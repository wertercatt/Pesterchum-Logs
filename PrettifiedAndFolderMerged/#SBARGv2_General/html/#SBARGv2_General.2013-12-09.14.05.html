<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">what</span>'s that</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and thats that she has probably dealt with the least despair of anyone in the comic</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> feferi is a sue bc she only died and aside from that hasn't had any despair</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the fact that shes pretty heavily implied to be a shitty emperor...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: having to delegate the (insert lusus name) duties to eridan</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and that wasnt really a "small bit" of eridan drama either</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">contrariwise</span> I could say that was a point for being a sue; being too "nice" to do that even though that makes no sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">for</span> a troll</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">in</span> which every bit of culture revolves around not nice things so she is unrealistic in being nice for no good reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but still, the point is that /just about everything goes right/ for kanaya</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: except for the shit that affected the entire troll session</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">kanaya</span> has an alcoholic gf, got shot through the stomach, has a clown that she caNNot kill despite wanting revenge on, has to deal with the guilt of not doing anything about gamter even though rose told her it was abusive, had to spend a while getting over Vriska, was worried sick about Rose for a while because of how she went grimdark</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok first of all im gonna call just about anything gamzee-related something that effects the entire session</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think thats fair</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you know what i meant</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: :smooooooooooooooooOoOOoOoooth:</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">well</span> I would think</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, the gamter thing seems sorta minor in the grand scope of things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: THANK YOU</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> I guesss that could count, as long as you still count the revenge thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (because that only effects kanaya)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (no one else cares about her revengeboner)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also, im gonna say "things that happen to rose that upset kanaya" are fairly minor compared to whats happened to everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so that leaves</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: getting over vriska, and being injured and then healed almost immediately</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so still not much compared to everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span>'d still count those</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span> weren't that much but they do add up</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> the point is that really being a mary sue isn't about being too good</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s about taking up the focus</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">because</span> you're so overly good</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">kanaya</span> is still pretty background of a char even though she's more prominent</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">nowadays</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also tbh "i care too much about my friends weh weh" is a very sue-ish problem to have</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">while</span> she still is a bit overly good it's not in your face</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s pretty realistic</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">of</span> a problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> sues tend to use because they don't want to be sues</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah but when thats basically the only problem you have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not sure wether the stuff about having the resoponsability of trying to continue the troll race is a sue-ish thing in this context or not. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">yeah</span> that's whne it's sue-ish</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> would think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah having the responsibility to carry the troll race is a bit sue-ish too</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> that's not too sue-ish given that it realistically shows "oh crap this is stressful what if everything goes wrong"</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">a</span> bit sue-ish</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> not too much</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (though it does kind of throw it in the background)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (the stress)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: comes a bit too close to "i just want to be normal"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: which is so sueish jesus</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span>'s</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">also</span> sueish just from sue-abuse of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">sues</span> often just use it as "I just want to be normal" for no good reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> it actually has a good reason (like showing the stress) it still leaves a bad taste from the suebuse but not as bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">imo</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">But</span> yeah I think that it doesn't particularly matter if she's a sue</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and again, tbh all of this also needs to be put into the perspective of</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">because</span> she's in the background compared to everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hussie is a virgo</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Death</span> of the Author</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> can basically just ignore that</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it would be like if i made zodiac-themed characters and then made scorpio the most important and special of them all</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but no one of the things i love about hs is that the author /isnt/ separate</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hussie is a very real presence in the comic, both literally and figuratively</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even after his insert character dies <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">his</span> insert char has been foreshadowed to be breaking the fourth wall</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: homestuck is a comic where the characters, author, and audience are all blended</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and i love it</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">and</span> then the half of the comic she does come in she doesn't get very much of a cool edgy story, just a single special power when lots of others have their own special power or redeeming feature</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> anything I'd say hussie was scared to make her interesting by adding in cool edgy backstories</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah kefka as the darkly humorous mad clown was entirely a product of the localization team</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, didn't know that before.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: in the original japanese he just came off as a pure psychopath who made terrible attempts at humor</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like shitty puns mostly</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, I need to get a sensor bar replacement (might wind up rigging some remotes or a string of cheap lights) and I'll only be able to play downstairs in the living room because my room doesn't have a TV in it (my tv is in storage) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really wish the menu allowed camecube controller suport. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if you get a classic controller you dont need a sensor bar i dont think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: could be wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you can use its joystick just fine on the menu</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: on the wii main menu thing? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: plus the presence of a select button makes it better for vc games anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: by the way its been bothering me a bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: were you there when ash ragequit the incip memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sortakinda. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: do you think i was wrong to bring that up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me scroll up to see exactly what happened real quick... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: one or both of us was being an oversensitive shithead</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... personally, I think she was over-reacting to something that really didn't even warrent a flip-out like that. She tends to do that sometimes. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah but</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, whenever I get emotional, she yells at me. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: should i let that sort of thing get to me to begin with?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i get the same way when it comes to discussing... most of the cast of the avengers movies tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: male cast at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: should i be letting it get to me so much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (still typing) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I think it's okay to notice those sorts of things, but it's important to be able to focus on your own strengths. Sure, there's going to be plastic men that resemble some sort of ideal out there, but really, that doesn't say much about the person behind the plastic so much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but it still makes me feel really self-conscious yknow</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its like how i might drool over zooey deschanel when alone or when talking with other guys who also want to drool over zooey deschanel</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (zoosmell who?) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but im not going to sit in front of a girl who i know has body issues and start drooling over her</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shes an actress</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't really keep track of famous people all that much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me ask you a question: do you want to be consdered attractive? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: id like to be sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: id like to know that most people dont consider me ugly at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's understandable. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it can be hard to know what others think exactly, and you can't just change their opinions on the turn of a dime. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but you shouldn't let that affect how you feel about your self-image too much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (man, I'm really sucking at this advic thing, am I?) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but its particularly bad with some instances - and im not saying the bit on incip is one of them - when its someone i have a crush on gushing about how hot this other guy is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and no youre doing fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean when its someone i already dont think i have a chance with</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stating to make a bit more sense now... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and theyre talking about how hot tom goddamn hiddleston is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dunno i just have general feelings of inadequacy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like on some level it really made me happy to know people were upset i couldnt participate in closing the blue hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because it means im someone people think about, you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: right. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and im reflecting the hell out of that ic right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i really am scared that well all drift apart when the rp is over</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: since pathetic as it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm afraid of that a little bit too, but I know at least some of us will stick around. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this is the first place i feel like im important</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I know what you mean. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i feel like i could just lock myself in my room for the rest of my life and the only reason anyone would care is because i wouldnt be pulling my weight</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and its not even like a suicidal thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but here i actually feel important and needed</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fuck its 4 am and im barely coherent i know</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it completely makes sense. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like knowing i genuinely upset people with amy's death makes me really happy and not even in a sadistic way</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (though thats part of it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just knowing that i crafted a story that genuinely affected pepople on an emotional level you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i never had that before</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, that PM RP thing with the hot cocoa was pretty awesome, and I really think it's cool how your character has spurred development with others. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shit just the fact that i have something im known for</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the weird, vaguely body horror-y surrealist stuff i like</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that means more to me than you can imagine</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: is that silly of me?its not really even a positive thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it's wonderful. Like, you've obtained attention and you're being notied, and best of all: others still want to talk to you. It's a great feeling to be acknowledged. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and... was the hot cocoa thing really that great? it was mostly just me going through the motions tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I admit a lot of it was on my art, but it still had some effects afterwards. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *part ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its kind of funny, i mostly went into that to privately bash fl as a character</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but then that didnt work out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: things rarely go according to plan. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sbargv2 was the first rp i ever really participated in</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i saw it on the memo list after reading the sburb glitch faq</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and i was afraid it was going to be... well everything that comes to mind when you hear "homestuck roleplay</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i actually came on partially to troll everybody</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: on some level i still am</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i really dont know if ill ever find a group as great as this one</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can still remember that first meeting when everyone was showing off their selfies. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think i actually started that when i didnt have any art of my character</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, maybe not started it exactly, considering I'd been using a shooped photo of myself as a ref around that time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im really not a fan of projecting an idealized version of myself as a character unless its part of the setting</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im fat and neckbearded irl, i can be fat and neckbearded in the game too</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. being able to show flaws in characters while writing can really add another level of compellingness. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think it helps keep me from a chris-chan situation where i have this version of myself thats such a painful form of hiding from who i really am</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: honestly chris-chan is one of the best things to happen to me motivation-wise</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it gave me something to strive to not be</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (wait, that's the sonichu guy, right?) ➜</span><br />
