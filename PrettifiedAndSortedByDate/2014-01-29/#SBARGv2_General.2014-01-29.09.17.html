<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: go for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT billiardHounds <span style="color:#00b6b6">[CBH]</span>  suddenly remembers why he quit the RP part of the memo --</span><br />

<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: and y'know what</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: you're right</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I haven't made my point yet ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: and I should just quit</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: LET ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: so I will</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ME ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: TYPE ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: last night you were attempting to bring a dormant character back into use when you already have a handful that take turns being active. That being said, I did everything I could ICly possible to prevent having to be the one responsable for said reactivation. Now, I realize you want to follow the reason behind said actions and take it all back, but that would be unfair to those who have participated in the &lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">event last night, because frankly: it's rare that any reactionary type stuff even happens very often and it probably added some character development that shouldn't be removed for the sake of fixing a mistake which has already been made. Thereare ways without retcons that you can deactivate AC or limit the use of your alts (a possible headcanon: some of the swap-out characters could very well be the same person</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">ICly wearing a variety of disguises) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: except</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: there was no event</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: I decided not to do the event</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: because i'm scared of GMing it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AC being untimelocked WAS the event.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah &gt;_&gt; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: except no one was involved</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yes, they were ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: so no character dev even happend</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I PM'd CP and EQ during the event for advice, and fluffy asked to be apart of the shenanigans as well. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: okay fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: I see your point</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: even so</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: FL's right</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: its stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh /hell/ no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: my shenanigans are stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am not going to be used as an example in this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: you've all said that on multiple occassions</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's the way you pull them off that's kinda shakey ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that thing one of your chars did last night with the pig seems to serve as a perfect analogy for your modus operendi. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: modus operendi?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: oh I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first: you bring something in that hasn't been confirmed to be a thing, second: you try to get others to go with your plot plan, thridly:other attempt to let you know about your logical falicies, forthly: you wind up breaking down and destroying the thing you were working on, most likely out of shame, as if it had no impact on things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (can somebody please tell me if I'm being irrational here? I'm starting to feel like I'm being too biased) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">no</span> sounds all good SJ</span><br />

<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: not a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: i'm sure you aren't the only one thinking that, SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: well I guess you aren't really thinking that</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: or are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: I can't fucking tell</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I feel like sometimes I'm a bit too hard-core when it comes to preserving continuity and the suspension of disbelief. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">nah</span> it sounds p valid complaints from my end</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seems okay to me too</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: its valid</span><br />
<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: still think I oughta just unmake that a thing, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: can't you just leave the past alone and work from a forward perspective? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: its the last shit like that i'll be doing though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Am I a bit extreme with the suggestion of a temporary ban?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you said that last time too, didn't you? ➜</span><br />
