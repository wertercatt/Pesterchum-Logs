<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: my father is a nationalist, war-mongering chauvinist, ultrasexist, extremely homophobic, and a childish narcissist who can't be reasoned with to boot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he says that it's a "truth" that "all gays have aids and only gays have aids and that that's nature's way of disposing of degenerates"</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Wanna do this to him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF:  <a href='http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/03feb/uf005240.gif'>http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/03feb/uf005240.gif</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he told me that a true man can't have female friends because that's "degrading to masculinity"</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: He's a fucking idoit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: you should see him talking up to my shrink</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: "NO HE DOESN'T NEED MEDS HE'S JUST FAKING HIS DEPRESSION'</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Okay<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: but there's no job market here</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Know how that feels.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: only 13% of work-capable youth in serbia actually have a job</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: maybe even not that many</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: most employers prefer older people</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: huh<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: so i'm financially dependent</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: yeah<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i told him i met a several gay people over the internet and he still doesn't believe me that they're not all effeminate and sex-obsessed</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: you know, when you hate other people so much that you can't live your own life, you're pretty much ripe for the meds</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i've given up on him</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: there's no way to make him even remotely rational</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i'm just going to go away and never turn back</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: and he's still alleging that finding a pair of tits to fuck is somehow going to cure me of my depression</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i hate him</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT fLmun [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sounds like he needs a shrink</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he says he is a "masculine, upright man who is not a fag and doesn't need medical help ever"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except not becuase that is sadly accepted in "normal" culture.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he called me a "faggy cunt" several times recently because i used to get sick every week or so when i was a small child</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i'm just sick of having to live with such an inhumane piece of shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: excuse me - you're for the systematic industrialised murdering of human beings who have done nothing to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: there's nothing "manly" about that because to be a man you have to be a human being first</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: of course, his father's "wisdom" he constantly drivels into my ears is the only thing he accepts</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: yes, he actually wants to kill all gays and infertile people</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: sorry for talking about this</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: and he's getting worse by the month</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he often shouts at me if i play any music he doesn't like and he says that all the people i know over the internet are "fat pigs"</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: great way to insult me as well, fuckface</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i mean, i can accept people who disagree, but i can't accept people like my dad</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he thinks that hurting innocent people is justified if they're "too different"</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: or rather</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: "different enough"</span><br />
