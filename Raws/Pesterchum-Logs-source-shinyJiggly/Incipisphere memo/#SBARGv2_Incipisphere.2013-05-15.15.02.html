<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nothing much at the moment</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((so I finally found myself a prototyped sprite))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((i had no idea what it'd be up until now))</span><br />
<span style="color:#15baaf">CAA: Okay. ^_^</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((also is it okay if I disregard my "canon" aspect for one I find more fitting))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((sure))</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (why the fuck not)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((because dunno))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (guardian took so damn long to get to this way past people probably already did stuff with one aspect or another in mind)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (so for guardian to throw a spider puzzle at you then give you /rage/ is just)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (fuck that noise right?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (fuck it long and fuck it hard)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (ah right)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (you just kept getting rage ?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (just the first time)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (rerolled)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (until i got mind)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (spent a saturday trying to see it right, failed)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (might try again later)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (icy)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (might not)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (are there a lot of Mind players ?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (don't really think so?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((a handful, but not too many))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (not too sure on the general distribution but i think its pretty even)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah, good.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((when I checked out the first SBARG thing it rolled me Mind IIRC))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but I don't remember what class))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((Page seems to fit I think))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (class hasn't shown up yet for probably best to leave it for the moment)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (iunno)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah right))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but I think I'll use Page if we need classes. it implies the player lacks part of the aspect in the first place ; it's associated with putting thoughts in action and I have a lot of trouble doing just that))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((plus weaponizing an aspect is awesome))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, after all this studying, I've come to a conclusion: Paradox space is held together by pretty much nothing but bootstraps and duct tape.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's kinda weird</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SBURB runs on ~ATH, we managed to DDOS it, and there are glitchly masses that will kill you floating in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: glitchy*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, more like cessation of existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you get the idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I don't think it was this bad before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Chances are its mostly the glitch that's causing the worse of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: As for the rest of it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I assume we caused.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: By DDOSing Sburb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With Rapid entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...Paradox Space isn't held together by duct tape and bootstraps, Sburb is just coded like a piece of shit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, does anyone have the codes for the sburb kitchen gear?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...also, Double carving is a waste of time.</span><br />
