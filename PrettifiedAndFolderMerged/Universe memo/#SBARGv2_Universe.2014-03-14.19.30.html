<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: BUT IT NEEDS A BETTER ONE ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I can feel this planet drawing me in, cloooser, cloooooser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like some kinda siren's call.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ty))</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: be careful about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You should be worried about that Envy</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: especially if it's this planet ._.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah it's fine, nothing I can't handle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's not! It's a completely different one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you sure that's not the pie at Gene's calling you? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's supposedly cursed, the COOLEST THING, the planet doesn't rotate at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh thank god it's not this planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It drifts and orbits, but it doesn't spin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You are still way too attached to curses</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course I am!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I proved the existence of an afterlife earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It was pretty cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...You what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: /What/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, well actually I proved it a while ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait, do you mean it's tidally locked so the same side always faces the sun, like Old Earth and its moon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Turns out dead people fill up these places called deadworlds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or that it never spins /relative to actual space/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah pretty much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...Did you see Kat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It just never spins, one side always faces the sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: One side doesn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah, I didn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I saw Merlynne and my mom but I didn't see Kat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Okay. That's. Okay. Your mom?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I thought she was alive what???</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay, tidally locked is kinda cool. the planet always having the same absolute orientation though would be even weirder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Or uh. Semi alive? </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Same absolute orientation pretty much actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Never spins relative to space, it's like frozen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The surface is frozen too, snow everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. whoa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Semi-alive too, I think. She's moving through deadworlds like nobody's business.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's how I got to them, chased her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh. That's relieving to hear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I think. Tell her I said hi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I will, for sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Thanks. </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But yeah the force is strong with this planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I can FEEEEEL it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: go young jedi</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: the force be with you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean I've never seen a cursed PLANET before, it's crazy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Even the pirates stay away from it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh hey I met the pirates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Mmhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ooh which ones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: what all am I missing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Everything beyond the starter planet, there's a whole universe out here!</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: all in can read is pirates, the force, and uh...tidelocked...whatever that means</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hence why I'm using the Universe memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: well, i'm not on starter either</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good! You're on your way</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: Yes but, i'm going to call this lace home</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: I also have a child to raise</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((NV, the site you linked isn't working... I clicked through to Episode 41, and there's no video player.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a good enough reason to stay home.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { wat }</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I think they were the ones who were raiding this galaxy, third planet from the main star, second cluster over from Starter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { All of them work for me ;; }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Huh! Awesome!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...temporarily disabling adblock...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: There was another bunch made entirely of angry penguinlike creatures.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { I'm using adblock rn and it works }</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: That was funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That sounds hilarious actually, I dig it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well it got funnier when I raided their shit and looted everything good</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...firefox or chrome?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: And then commandeered their ship. Wow. Seriously I should go out sometime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Firefox }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably!</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: God I need to fight someone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((no video player at all even with adblock and ghostery disabled, although attempting to load /all those fucking trackers/ nearly crashes the site.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: In a spar I'm just pent up here at this point.</span><br />
