<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  simply walks out of a wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  turns around.. yep, that was only one way. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fl what</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  flightcycles in... and promptly derezzes the bike into a gravestone. why does he keep /crashing/ today? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *appears out of nowhere!*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  You are standing on a platform above a large graveyard-like area. Multicolored glowing clouds blow  about lazily like a fog. On the ground, zombies, skeletons, and other "halloween-y" creatures roam, they cannot reach the platform. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  The creatures are /everywhere/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ZkRDgKoaw'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ZkRDgKoaw</a> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so yeah, this is the place</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT adorableSlayer <span style="color:#be00be">[CAS]</span>  already has her 6 carapace swords drawn --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has Requiem for a Whiplash and User's Revenge both ready to fire --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has a deck of cards and is grinning like mad*</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the enemies go down to pretty much anything, but they can swarm you if you aren't careful</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Let 'em..</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: They'll just die en masse!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if one has a pot on its back, theres a weapon or item in there you get if you kill it. i dont know how or why.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Really/?! /Awesome/! It's like a murderous treasure hunt!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but most of them dont, so theyre only good for grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: sweet, sweet, grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: free loot either way :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Midair calculus and treasure murder-hunts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: This place is… I /love/ this Game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: still, though, i can see why this land is abandoned</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if i entered this place as soon as i entered, theres no way i would have survived for more than a few minutes</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also: dont take items from enemies somebody else killed. theres plenty to go around, and i really dont want this to turn into a childish argument about who gets what</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you kill it, you get it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *stares at him blankly* /Obviously/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: just wanted to make sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  sideeyes ag --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *offended*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: anyway, go wild</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *launches herself down off the platform at the nearest enemies, somehow midair-summoning a demonic bicycle and managing to fling herself onto its back*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts firing jawbreakers at a group of skeletons coincidentally arranged in a bowling formation --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  leaps down, swinging his Bionic Arm in a circle --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((required listening: <a href='http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=47Y97lo4ve8'>http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=47Y97lo4ve8</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT adorableSlayer <span style="color:#be00be">[CAS]</span>  leaps down, a whirlwind of blades, into a cluster of zombies --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has drawn a black butterfly knife with a blade that almost looks like it's dripping, and another with a blade made out of what could easily be ice, and rides her demonbike into a cluster of enemies, slashing at anything that comes near her and letting her bike take out anything that gets near /it/*</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((you get to decide whats in the pots btw, this gives you an excuse to have that crazy weapon you couldnt figure out a believable alchemy formula for))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh, sweet</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hey guys1</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: *!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: found a cave over here</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the donjons here are pretty small, but they usually have good loot</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  collects the dropped grist and Ultra Bone Hammer, then runs over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: enemies never respawn here, either, the enemies that are there never leave and don't respawn when they die</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So anything in there is for killing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah, they dont drop loot though</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay, got it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: theres usually a chest at the end with something sweet though</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Everything in the cave is for killing, even if it doesn't loot-drop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Let's /do this thing/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *gets her demoncycle to turn and kicks it towards the entrance to the cave*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  Gambit rides over a tripwire, causing a dagger to fly  out of  the wall. Fortunately, she was too fast  to be hit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats new</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ponders how a rosary made of 12 jawbreakers can fire so many more than that, then shrugs and follows the others inside-- whoa traps --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe this is some special donjon</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...there are also usually enemies attacking by now</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: I don't remem8er ever coming in this cave, either...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok, just keep close</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  rolls for Detect Traps... and by that I mean does the Lighty Thing to illuminate any tripwires or other things --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  Holy shit, there's tripwires and pressure plates everywhere. They are all linked to various launchers that fire knives out of the floor, walls, and ceiling... hot damn that's a  lot of knives. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: All right, don't worry, I'll just murderalise anything that moves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *she's got her bike somehow flying a few inches above the ground now, a green Pentacle shield around her as she speed-demons her way through the cave*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  attempts to use the Lifey Thing to detect anything alive inside. He doesnt detect any life, but his class also limits usage of the Lifey Thing for detection purposes. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  uses a Vengeance Slip and runs through there before the temp-invincibility shield wears off --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  A voice echoes from deep within the cave... "Get out! Just leave me alone, dammit!" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: whoa, hey...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  shouts "Are you the one who set up all those traps?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  The voice calls back... "Wait, you aren't them, are you? You aren't the creatures?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We're worse!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Gambit...!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hang on, are you for killing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  The voice calls, "Who are you people?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Players!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  there is a scrambling sound from deep within the cave. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Are you for killing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  finishes disarming enough traps (by triggering them while invincible) to clear a safe path through --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lostKnight <span style="color:#000000">[CLK]</span>  peers out from behind a rock, only his head showing. He is unshaven, and has a wild look in his eyes. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3f002f">CLK: Don't come any closer! What do you want here?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Loot!</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Treasure!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Shiny things!</span><br />
<span style="color:#3f002f">CLK: I don't have anything you want.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3f002f">CLK: Can you... get me out of this place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: wait... are you this land's player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is a girl with semi-reflective eyes, cat ears and a tail, and a demon bicycle that's snarling bloody murder, and CP is a wolfsprite… thing-- she has to wonder how /they're/ not being mistaken for monsters or w/e*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sure!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Rescue missions and whatnot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: holy shit, you've been here all this time?!</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We can go /pick him up/ if need be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I already cleared a path... sorta...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lostKnight <span style="color:#3f002f">[CLK]</span>  comes out from behind the rock, hopping nimbly  across the cave. Though CP has already disabled most of the traps, he still navigates past where they were. He is wearing the tattered remains of a t-shirt and a pair of jeans. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *promptly tosses a black cloak at him* Here, stylish one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lostKnight <span style="color:#3f002f">[CLK]</span>  takes the cloak and wraps it around himself --</span><br />
<span style="color:#3f002f">CLK: Thank you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lostKnight <span style="color:#3f002f">[CLK]</span>  jumps a bit, noticing the spider, and reaches for a knife at his waist before relaxing when he realizes she poses no threat. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks at the memo on a vidwindow, then facepaws --</span><br />
