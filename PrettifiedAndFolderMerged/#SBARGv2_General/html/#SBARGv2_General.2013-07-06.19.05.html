I don't want to be upset over something, but I don't want AE to upset others thinking he's helping and I don't want him to get upset thinking he's doing more harm than good. This has gotten into something bigger than was ever intended. MG's got her thing she's dealing with, I'm practically over mine since I talked it over with NN, SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">and even AE (not knowing that he would post those things). I just want to stop seeing people getting upset. I don't think I'm the only one who likes getting upset.  :&gt;</span><br />
