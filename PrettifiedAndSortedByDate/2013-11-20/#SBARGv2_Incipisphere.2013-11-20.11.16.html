<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay. well, assuming the proportions are the same between 64 and 64DS, the portal to Dire Dire Docks /is/ only a few steps away from Bowser in the Fire Sea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its a bit of a path to get from the basement to the front door of the castle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you actually could have tripped over something right as you exited (idk what though) and fallen in...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its also a wall to floor gravity shift.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, after I managed to fly back up to the magicant, you guys had already gone through.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like what you did to the door, but did you really have to blow up the terminal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .../we didn't/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I just waited for you guys for a bit, then padlocked the terminal door, and headed back through the closet door to LoFaT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So perhaps Mewtwo blew it up so... something didn't go after him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe Mew?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ... ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what even.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you padlocked the door, and yet it was /torn off the wall.../</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Either we can blame aliens and ignore that, or Mewtwo fucked with your memories.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ....What? /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe someone put it back on the wall, but not connected all the way? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No its... pretty torn off the wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the terminal seems like it exploded from the inside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, did anyone even notice if it was only propped up but not hinged or anything? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if it was from the inside... maybe Mewtwo deliberately overloaded the door?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: o<span style="color:#730e8f">.0</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, the door was ripped off the wall... Like, this seems like Telekinesis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, grabbing something inside of the computer and /yanking it out/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's just weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets blame Aliens/Mewtwo/Glitches for that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh btw, Ash, you didn't completely delete your planning progress on v2Ronpa right? after things quieted down later, a couple of us wondered about still trying to do the "our existing v2 chars in the DR universe" version... since forcing everyone to use new self-inserts makes it feel a lot /less/ connected to v2...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, meta-stuff like that... just blame weirdness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or memory fuckage.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((No i still have the notes))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the question still remains... why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering Mewtwo is a powerful Psychic type, it makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah, why didn't he just kill you guys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...no idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok, good. reading back over the log, it sounded like you ragequitted the original idea entirely... just wanted to check ;) ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would he have a reason to straight-u kill strangers? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *up ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doubt it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats... something that points away from Mewtwo being responsible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but maybe it did it to /protect/ us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((I'll make a memoi about it because I dont know what was discussed after I fell asleep last night))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or... one of the two did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'll just send you the log))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Memos up anyway))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, that makes sense, after all, Missingno was in the game, and that might... be dangerous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But is Mewtwo a good guy... thats the question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, do any of us look like we could belong to Team Rocket? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dammit, I hate this orange and blue mortality shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...do we even know if it was Mewtwo specifically that blew the terminal? it might've been the original Mew, protecting us from Mewtwo instead...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do know one thing, and that was that... information wound up being taken from other media... Like, I had him on the ropes!... then he fucking /mega evolved/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not reassuring...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: MEGA EVOLUTION ISN'T EVEN POSSIBLE IN RED AND BLUE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that means he'd have to have a trainer that's bonded a lot with him or something like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or he can do it alone like in the anime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: speaking of cross-gen hax, I really hope a sitch like this wasn't the cause... <a href='http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-wanna-be-the-very-best'>http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-wanna-be-the-very-best</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I stopped watching the anime after Misty left, so I'm not an expert on that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...though to be honest, I didn't really give up a good fight after he mega evolved into Mega Mewtwo X.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He kicked me across the cave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, it seems the orignal japanese media is prefered.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As the Old Man was fucking wasted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pff</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfffft ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But if thats the case... maybe Mew isn't exactly good either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, so that's why he was blocking the path in the original japanese version of red? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, passed out drunk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...If they add another type to Gen 7, I think I know what it should be weak against!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (I think the Mewtwo Returns special was the best thing with mewtwo)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But you know, easily forgiven after a trip to space to contemplate our navels</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And hey Mega Evolution relying on bonds between trainers and pokémon? HAHAHAHAHAHA fuck that noise merchandising says we arbitrarily give this fuck the ability to do it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because it's not like the requirement for this power-up is founded on any semblence of bonds or shit. And it's not like our main character's an ineffectual loner</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They should have made it so the friendship stat needed to be maxed out to mega evolve!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As well as the Champion, but that one is understandable at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not /directly/ stated in X and Y that you need the strong bond, well, it is, but its the professor that says it, and to be perfectly honest... hes a dumb sack of shit.</span><br />
