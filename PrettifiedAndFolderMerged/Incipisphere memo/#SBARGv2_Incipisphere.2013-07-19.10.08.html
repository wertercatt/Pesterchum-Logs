<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i see what you mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're talking about sending a meteor through the center gate. the issue is that that gate is predtermined by skaia.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Instead of having a bunch of meteors, instead, you have a battleship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that was the result of outside tampering and the scratch</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SE: well, what if the gates send the meteors to our past selves' houses anyway, and in fact, our session was predestined to have a Fake Reckoning in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And as the battle field was in an eternal stalemate, the black queen is gone, and the white queen has the sceptre...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As well as the fact that Prospit has been destroyed and the white queen is likely dead...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, in that session.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that makes this a very different situation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While still preventing skaia from being destroyed... by the reckoning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... I thought the meteor plan was dropping the meteors that /chased us into the game/, and not the ectobabbies (which afaik haven't even been a thing for us yet)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...CP, remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but keeping in mind though that the black court is destined to win and defeat the white one and then start the reckoning all on its own</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We have already had glitched meteors flying at skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ We essentiallyy have t defeat the black king before the Reckoning Gets too bad /)</span><br />
