<span style="color:#410f41">plans come to obvious fruition. The Seer would fully comprehend the way that people’s actions alter Time’s natural course and the consequences of these changes, and would do their best to keep events on track and prevent unnecessary deaths and offshoot timelines.

<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: Also</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: "So, a Prince of Heart could destroy his or others’ fundamental identities, the qualities that make them who they are, rendering them hollow and fake, mere shells of the vibrant people they used to be. Alternatively, the Prince may champion their own principles, emotions, and morality as their cause, and with sheer force of will wreak destruction on anything that does not coincide with their core beliefs."</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Of course /you're/ looking forward to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: OH CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Do you have any music that makes you think of fire?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: like instrumental stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: "A Prince of Mind, on the other hand, smashes right through the façades that people erect and their externally-based motivations, leaving only their raw identities, and potentially destroying their ability or desire to make rational decisions. On the flipside, this Prince uses their cunning and composure as their weapon, breaking down their obstacles through careful thought and planning."</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, "I've never been on a LOGAE dungeon" is definitely a correct statement :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: Can i just</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, one sec...</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: goddamn Anna</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ugh, snipmp3 makes everything lag when I have it open in chrome :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: true facts CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i love how thorough she is</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: aw</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: i use youtube-mp3.org</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: ^because of that guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: it's so god damn fast</span><br />

<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: one video got broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: I think I use listentoyoutube</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: last night</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: wait really</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i have yet to have that happen to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: processing but no link whatsoever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: that sucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AG, for /downloading/ the songs, not just looping them...</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: there's like a bunch others but verdammt</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: ... listentoyoutube /does/ download</span><br />

<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: oh yeah I download then loop on iTunes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, the only two fire-type songs that come to mind are the original Lethal Lava Land, and Melty Molten Galaxy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: no but really youtube-mp3.org is really damn fast to download, and the quality is always at best</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">?NV: I use vdownloader</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i've heard of that, never tried though</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">?NV: I really like it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">?NV: Best quality audio, makes a little chart of all the songs and things I've added, lets me add video</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">?NV: For those times when I really want to show people "Big Bad Wolf"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: that's pretty neato</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Hey, what dungeon events are scheduled for like the next two weeks?</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: This and next week?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, we really need a calendar for these things ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: FF's is this Wednesday, mine is this Friday, FA's is next Friday/Saturday</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also: manually converting texpacks is /hard/ :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but it's my only option since mojang's tools don't work correctly with HD packs or OptiFine-style animations...</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: And Amory, you can't make it any day before Friday?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Fuck. I want to do LOGAE before Ash's, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: Hydra's home on Friday, which means wifi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: Hence why I /can/ push my event a day earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: I need her to also pay me back the $30 she owes me</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Would a lot of people be able to make it this Saturday?</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: So I can at least go and have enough money</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: most likely not</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'd probably be able to make it ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: /dammit Kris/</span><br />

<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: ... Oh damn SV is gonna be pissed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just please don't ask them to move theirs to next saturday, I just had a grandparent-visit sprung on me for that :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">?NV: Comic-Con is more important than sbarg rn</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I posted my "days I can't RP at all basically" on your piratepad sheet for the LOGAE dungeon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Fi, I'm not sure you'll be able to make it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: ... wait when is it</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Sometime next week :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Before Friday.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: I just need $20 for bus tickets and $6 for lunch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: And then I have wifi for one day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: the extra bus tickets are just a bonus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Right. So figure this out sooner rather than later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: any time next week that isn't saturday or sunday should work :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: I'm thinking Wednesday/Thursday next week. The 14/15.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i can work with that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that'd be good with me :D got a potential start time, or just "whenever everyone that signed up is online"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: "hey dudes grab your shit LET'S GO"</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">?SA: you're going to need to tell me the night before.</span><br />
