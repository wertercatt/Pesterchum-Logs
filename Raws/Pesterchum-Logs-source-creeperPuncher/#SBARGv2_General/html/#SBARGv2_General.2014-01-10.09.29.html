<span style="color:#860000">CNK: at least some of the things she was complaining about she was present during</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: if she wasn't paying attention then ????</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and she was really being aggressive and</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: jesus i hate to use this term</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: a little bit bitchy about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I'm almost sure she was on when EQ was talking to her denizen on multiple occasions</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: No denizens. No senseless killing of characters. No bullying other members and I don't /care/ whose fault it is and I don't want pointing fingers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: there was no bullying</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: of /anyone/</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: by anyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Otherwise I s2g, the memos are getting closed.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: I am being VERY lenient letting you guys continue running this after the main story has finished and letting you do your own thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: But some of this shit is ridiculous and needs to stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: :?</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sorry about being a horrible person with no job and not even doing my part and being an idiot and still hanging out with the very few people that I still call my friends ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this isnt your fault either niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its nobodys fault</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: everybody was some degree of shitty or another</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: not everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but the freaking game master is angry, and she threatened to splitus up forever. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: actually, I think SJ was one of the nicer people here</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: she threatened to delete the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but she wou;d probably go after us or something.] ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe even going chumplist!sethtier ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok good youre joking</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm being irrational here ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#860000">CNK: k</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I just don't like the thought of being restricted from talking to you guys just because something messed up somewhere. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you wont be restricted from talking to anybody</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: we could just</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: make a new memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: deleting the memos doesnt mean destroying all contact with each other</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ah christ, i really hope ash doesnt catch wind i called her bitchy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we could just add everyone to our contacts on here</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: i don't mean to undermine the GM but (She i tink??)? cant' physically wipe the characters from our minds :?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CMA: also doesn't mean you can't just... y'know. make another memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: she only has so much power over us</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also shes honestly probably exaggerating to make a point</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i seriously doubt shes going to delete the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but wouldn't she try to get rid of that memo as long as the majority of the v2 peeps were in it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: thats stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: if she's going to be that bitchy</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we can ignore her</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: how though</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CMA: just make a different memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but if she wanted to get rid of us, she would do that ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: how?</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: "ghost dunk pls delete this memo becuse i don't like it"</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: i doubt she'd do that anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...can memos even /be/ deleted?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CMA: also technically you can't "delete" a memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: they can</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: she can set it to autoban everyone who joins though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I'm assuming she doesn't actually have that much power outside of the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: i know this because i have owned some</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you can probably block a memo from being accessed ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and not let anyone in ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: plus we'll have other projects</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: should i feel this terrible for standing up for myself? for everybody?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: we wouldnt even need to name new ones after sbargv2</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i feel like i fucked up</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ok, setting up autoban would work... until the memo unregistered itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: no man u did good</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: didn't you say you'd be retrying PMDRP at some point?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just because i talked back when i thought the gm was being more than a bit tyrannical</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I feel like I screwed up by trying to say something to FA. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: you didn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SL, none of this is your fault. SJ, same with you, you didn't cause this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im terrified that shes never going to be willing to talk to me again</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: everyone was out of line there</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: especially if word gets back i called her bitchy oh god</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: w/e</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: if people cant handle being called out on their attitude</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: they need to just</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: get off the internet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: since thats</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shes gonna ban me from pesterchum and skype and 3ds and everything and i feel sick to my stomach about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wouldn't doubt it if the GM showed up one day as SF, did the prince of space thing and destroyed gene with our characters in it and said the end. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: y'know</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: big thing on the internet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: *cough cough* anons *cough cough*</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: and then one of us will make a new memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: similar name</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: hashtag that wouldn't kill our characters</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: nothing has changed</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i tried to grow a backbone and look what it did for us</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: its not your fault</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm usually a doormat too. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah it kind of is</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: no look its ok if gms are piss-poor at their jobs</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if i had sat down and shut up wed be fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: it really isn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: she isn't i don't think</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: you just have to</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: like</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: you and SJ were both pretty much the nicest people here</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: work around them</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: even when you were talking to FA</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i was not nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  techinically was a GM, thank you for insulting me, I dserved that thsanks --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: you were nicer than everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont lie to me to make me feel better</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: i wa snt referring to y ou</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and watchu talkin bout</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: in fact</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: you were plenty nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: SL I don't lie</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: i know nice gms just</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: some of them are</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: never cared for that shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: really bad at gming</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I may do it playfully every once in a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but i'd never lie about something like this</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: look imma be honest from what ive seen of her the gm is generally um</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: you and SJ, not just now</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: unstable</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no one tell her i said that but its true</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: are always amazing</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: i had a dnd gm that got so fucking pissed when one of us looked up what a monster looked like to call him out on something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and really helpful and nice people</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CMA: i'm... pretty sure you guys are letting your imaginations get to your heads and blowing this out of proportion. but maybe i'm just looking at this wrong. i don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont put me on the level of sj</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: and then we quit the session and forbid him from gming again</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: she is infinitely better than me</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: 'v'</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: she basically ran the rp at one point</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just sit here and bitch at people</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: you're nice though</span><br />

<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: you're really nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you guys remember when FL had that thing that vaguely mentione angels and then everyone was afraid of it going the scode route with angeldarkness? That was all because I snitched to the GM group and let them know that it was a thing and I felt horrible for it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I agree with MA on this one. I think, before long-term stuff is made and done, people need to just sleep for a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: keeping fl from being godmoddy as shit is not something to be ashamed of</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also i dont think i can sleep at this rate</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: in a setting like this GMs have gotta be fun police</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...should i kick kaylen from the pmdrp gm skype memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but it was just a minor detail with his land quest that was intergral to the plot he was writing, and it made him feel like he wanted to quit ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...Nak unfortunately has a point. if there were no restrictions, /all/ of us would eventually devolve into munchkins.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no SL ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: don't mess with any power structures, just be nice and let her calm down. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i hope ash comes back</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: we used to have a system back when i was mod of some memos</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (speaking of skype memos: what even is the "I don't know what" memo?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: fun police and overbearing are different though and not mutually exclsuisive so w/e</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: where the mod would have helpers</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (I know it was briefly a PMDRP thing, but...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: and the mod and helpers would discuss issues in the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: and find a way to work it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: (I dunno)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: (its just a whatever thing now I guess)</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: not just one person gming everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: (if anyone ever wants to just hangout or whatever)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im gonna try to go to bed i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I liked it better when people would actively ask questions via the ask box to figure out canon stuff. Like,  when everyone was trying to figure out how the modded second gate mechanics worked. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill be on skype mobile</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: //tucks you in</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: how are the sbargv2 memos operated?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: night SL, hope you sleep ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: night</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: oh, 'night</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: usually NN runs them, butright now she's on vacation. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: otherwise it's pretty lenient. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: //should be in bed since its like 1am but im trying to settle you guys cuz things will be ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: i mean like how are tey hosted</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: SB's right</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I used to have OP shades, but they expired after a while. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: is it just "us" being on keeping it up or??</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: mostly yeah, it's been the players keeping things rolling with minor outside input. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Man</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: ah, i was just wondering with the being lenigtiant about us continuing having basis of the memo being up affecting the GM</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: honestly i think that was just the gm being a tyrant</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though there's always been usually at least one or two folks with connections in the main memos at most times just in case, myself being one of them. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and most of the times I preferred to say nothing because I thought it was going okay and didn't want the players to feel like they were being watched. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and like, those who did bend canon usually pulled it off in a cool way that was interesting on a narritive level. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (........now I finally get how that one event worked, where FI was pestering SL and mentioned a joke that was said in Incipi despite not being in the memo himself)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: sorry, SJ :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: 'v'</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: //bends canon but tries to make it not sound completely ridiculous</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, with that one event, considering SV was behind it, he broke a lot of guidelines, including slipping with his cover so easily. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: i can understand the GM's dislike for the denizen thing that was blown out of proportion but i don't get FA's since its not even bending canon</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: i just???</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: she can just get kinda... uptight about things. She yelled at me once for floating on an icecube made of frozen macaroni and cheese even though I had a legit reason for having that in my inventory. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: i think FA just needs a break from the memo to cool down</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: 'v'</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it seems she likes to romanisize things to her vision and doesn't like it when others go against the contrary of thatvision. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: she's uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: i had a compliment but forgot it</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: halfway throuhg</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: creative?</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b3b58">CSB: //just putting a compliment there so a nice thing can be said</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... I think Replay Value gave Doom players (regardless of class) an ability that /pauses the death script/ or something weird like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though obviously it'd only work in-session :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: how functional ARE classpect powers in the new universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: most of them work as they have before. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or at least I assumed that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pretty much everything, far as I've seen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's just alchemy stuff that's stopped working...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, mostly for balancing reasons.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: why's that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (also my Closet Door back to the session got retconned, but in retrospect it was a dumb idea)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first of all, with no source of grist income, thery were going to become unusable anyways. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but other tech, like replicators (Trek-type) and cookalizers, still work</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: so the grist ran out is the reason?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: technically yeah ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Kinda? Its part that, and part the tech just stopping working, I thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I've heard both "it ran out" and "it got /cut off/", but functionally they're equivalent...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though without alchemy, it makes it feel like there's still some sorta challenge and weight to things now, which I sorta like for  some dumb reason. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: nak wasted all his griist on hats &amp; creating a time travel device from the time player meteronome</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still not sure why I let Nak keep the metronome. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: 'v'</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... it broke because Nak spent it all then? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: potentially ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: was everyone's grist cache's linked?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: through gristtorrent, probably...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's been said to be linked due to widespread grist torrenting ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I'm thinking I'm gonna have SS's stuff stripped down to a very limited selection of things</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: he made a /LOT/ of hats</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that reminds me, most of SJ's house stuff is still tiny-sized due to being shrinky-dinked to it in her sylladex. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like, his outfit obviously, two swords, and his hoverboard</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *fit ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: maybe the grappling hook too</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: cause i liked the grappling hook</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, there's just a bunch of dollhouse-sized furniture and stuff. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: so did all the sprites survive into the new universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, they got converted to non-sprites on the way. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: ...so that means there's a fucking steamwork dragon</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which means no sprite powers, no game info, and probably legs. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: wondering around</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: what about inanimate objects though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Nak, what was your sprite again? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: rocksprite? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: rock + dragon plush</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: it's a dragon though</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: so it's alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: remember, prototyping is broad in its attribute acceptance</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: its like a scalemate esque dragon</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: though</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: nak thought it was a nakodile fallen in battle</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: and just</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: threw it in</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: mine was a dragon statue</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: combined with a steamwork robot</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: o_o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if mine made it through, it would have wound up becoming an irl high school mascot antro tiger. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: im just imagining</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: all the sprites having long feminine legs with fishnet stockings and generic high heels</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: just sitting around</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: haha. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: wha</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, if CP hadn't ascended, his de-spriting would basically be equivalent to how he is now, minus GT abilities.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: unfortunately, I silently killed that sprite offscreen by having him actually get hit by a meteor duing the reckoning like I thought they were supposed to do, and really he only showed up again after so long because SV mantioned specifically that he had saved the sprites from dying. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alsowhoashitit'saftermidnightgoodnighteverybody</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you think that was cruel to do to that character that didn't even get very much screen time? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -woahitisaftermidnightokayigottaheadtobedaswellnight</span><br />
