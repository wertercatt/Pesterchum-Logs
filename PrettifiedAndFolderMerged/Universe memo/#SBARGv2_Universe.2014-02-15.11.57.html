<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AD: a guy from the session. we... don't like to talk about him that much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: that bad huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he was kinda manipulative ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...i see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and probably the reason why we don't have a specific "leader". ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: oh sheesh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... Kat's gone shithive maggots because she's remembering him, huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: or maybe remembering him is the only reason why we can get close to her now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: in some, weird backwards way</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it might have some stuff to do with aspect inversion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ever hear about that theory? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. it's one of the more common mechanical explanations of grimdarkness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Light Players act Voidy, Life Players apparently act Doomy, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, apparently a player has a chance of embracing the opposite aspect of their "true calling" if they're under a certain behavioral condition. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and it usually doesn't end well at all. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Sounds pretty complicated</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...yeah... Rose only snapped out of it through stabs, and even though Jade's grimbarkness was artificially induced, it still took a house to the head...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in a way, that could be used to explain the sylph's actions, considering it also can cover classes... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's the opposite class of Sylph?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: prince ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a rince of life is said to destroy life, which can be applied towards life players as well. ➜</span><br />
