<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why would I play games when I have a mystery to solve</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because we don't have any leads.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its a matter of waiting for a planet to explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Planets have already been exploding!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then figure out in which direction its happening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It started in that solar system we let her out in but then it just stopped like she just didn't do it anymore</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then I was like "Okay that lead is dead" so I tried to find another lead, found the Library.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe someone managed to shoot her in the head already?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, just some average aliens?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be anticlimatic as hell, but if you treat it like reality... you know, like it /supposedly is/... it would make a lot of sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hell, maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like just, BOOM, headshot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell it could have been just a normal farmer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: with a shotgun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But she did end up showing up on the chat after I saw the planet booming stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe she got shot and stopped for a second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just start tracking if planets start going boom again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And if people live on those planets?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't want to wait for things to start dying to find a lead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Though I mean in the context of serial killers sometimes that's a valid option.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, you know what they say, a million is a statistic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, that is not what they say, that is what Stalin says.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Stalin was a violent sociopath who ran the USSR!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might be sad, but its the truth. We don't feel as much emotional attachment when its more than one person that dies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hell maybe we missed something at the library. They're already out, I gotta go back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe see if Yaldabaoth'll talk again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /wat/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay so the library, right? It had these cubes, and when we put the cubes in the slot this like</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Holo-Baoth appeared and chatted us up</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( you know what, lets just let Ash and Kaylen deal with this if they show up ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And then it stopped talking when Isaac started asking it about trading cards</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually it might've just been a picture but Rob's magic ~Heart senses~ hissed at the hologram or...something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe Rob was coughing up a hairball.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So apparently its just that the body of a denizen can't go through the door and shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I actually don't even think it was a real denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it was just an animated picture, like if you read a book about a denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Signs point to it being a soul.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So a denizen soul made it through a door.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or likely through a defence portal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now that would make more sense, but why a defense portal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But really, the door seems close to a defense portal in some ways</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're a Heart hero right can't you do a soul-talkey thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I should stay here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Work on the design of the Dakkatank.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What you think if it is a soul it'll be pissed at you for nuking your own planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe /someone/ should go and get Hannah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since we /all forgot about that/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh god what even happened to Hannah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Shes stuck on an alien planet with green grass</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and a blueish sun (if I remember right)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: that could be like</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: A million planets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Billions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Trillions</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((back from shower))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean first of all, every planet is an alien planet, so it's literally just a planet with green grass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And a blue sun. </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and an oxygenated atmosphere... maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since most godtiers can breathe in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Is nemean on the memo IC? ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#716604">CNL: who exactly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hannah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: because if someone just ran off then its not my job to find them- oh</span><br />

<span style="color:#716604">CNL: word of the wise: dont discredit my trackers</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, NV, could you go and pick her up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I uh, sure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: okay thats a plan sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: but</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: She is likely gonna be pissed as hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: why should I give teh exact co-ords</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: *the</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: i mean dont you people still have a lot of trouble to deal with involving that cal person</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why not ask Gambit what to do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: or was that cleaned up</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I guess that's not cleaned up and got worse so maybe just</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Tackling a problem we can fix right now'd be nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: well the thing is this is not such a problem that needs attention right now. i checked in a week ago, mostly everything is fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: sure as heck better then what you all are dealing with</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: honestly, why should i tell you the co-ords now? once you have stuff settled and dont have a murderer on your hands then sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I'll just let her know you didn't tell us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: who, hannah? good luck with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Logically, she should still be connected to the Ring Server</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Logically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Check.</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: ... great now you got her to nag me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (not gonna say check mate, but its /pretty damn close/)</span><br />

<span style="color:#716604">CNL: rude</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: but heres a handly little feature: the ignore button</span><br />

<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Stymied by basic features. What now, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You do realize she could just change her chum handle /slightly/ and keep going with the nagging, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: so I could do the same then: go on a different handle and they would have no idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: 'sides why do i need to be online</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: like... okay if I really wanted i could just log off of pesterchum and then what can any of you do</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: none of you people know my skype</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You mean your skype that only manages to work through the ring server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, I /could/ start fiddling with the white and black lists</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: then we couldn't contact this thing at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe prevent connections except to certain external servers</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: as soon as you figure out what you are going to do tell me, because until then I'm going to be watching animal-planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Through the ring server's connection to beta earth?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I know what /my/ IP is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so thats 1/5</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: y'know if this is an attempt to give up co-ords you are going about this all wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: this just makes me want to go over to the co-ords and get rid of everything there instead</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right I'll just leave you alone</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: hmph. Thats what I thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sure NV and SJ can handle this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...wait what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Don't lump me in with Niki we work horribly together</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like SJ could check for a note with the coords that would be done via stable time loop</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: pft sure let the space-time-duo deal with the murder lion good plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or you could stop tosting me every 5 seconds ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or that</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: that is also a plan</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: where's my rough and tumble street gang when I need them</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only issue with that is there is multiple answers that could appear to be correct in that one case</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if the answer is limited to only being the true correct answer (like, P=NP), then it works</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but it /makes sense/</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What if in the future the coords change</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So in the present we end up going to the future coords and there's jack shit there</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: thats also a possibility</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((ah, okay then...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am confused again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((if it makes you feel slightly better, SJ stayed behind because she didn't want to damage her ears anymore))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but yeah, long as it's after 2pm PDT - and my parents cooperate and let me get home on time! - I should be able to make it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay, maybe that's worse))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I'm not even sure))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { It gives me no strong feelings one way or the other }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Last night's event was a little bit of a mess and I totally apologize for it }</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((would it be a teleport-there event finishing or just watching on webcamShinyjiggly?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Let's go with webcam, probably }</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah, I guess that's easier logistically))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: (( hi guys :D ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Herro }</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sup))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((hi there))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: (( done planning? :3))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I got mauled by a wolf sic'd on me by my mom, who's also like part-wolf or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Never done planning }</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((:b))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am now less confused. </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But before that I had a dog, then I cared for a bunch of wolves and dogs on LoFaR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So I ran a pack, sorta. Then I "inherited" two souls that look kind of like little balls of doge that were "heirlooms" from my mom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Before I went on a vision quest or some shit. It's all a very long and dumb story.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I will take your word for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am finding the pack mentality of the wolf family to be interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: The Dire wolf seemed to have been very much like huamns.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((*humans))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: It makes me wonder</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: because the Dire wolf is extinct</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, I'm /still/ trying to sort my wolf instincts out, being one of the only ones around here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You just gotta yolo it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's how I learned all my instincts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Perhaps you two could form a small pack</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not I'm not a natural wolf leader.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess my main problem is that a fair amount of instinctual behaviors conflict with human standards of dignity or something :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Such as?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, territory marking, for one <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  apologizes for the mental image --</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, because humans don't pee on things to claim them????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: No?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Probably not</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: hwoever I have found a relevent quote</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I remember you shit yourself all the time though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like when 682 showed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: "For man, the whole world is his bathroom"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh... I still want to forget that day... not because of that, but because I went FL Tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: FL Tier?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: one word: antimatter. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSR</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: How can I deduce the meaning of the conversation with one word that seems far removed from the conversation you are attempting to clarify?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That was funny as hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I'll explain a little. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you know what happens when antimatter hits regular matter? huge asplosion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL kept trying to expariment with antimatter a lot during the session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm pretty sure every single attempt ended in failure until he blew up his planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he only used it a handful of times, but he talked about it like a girlfriend or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: fondly</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My sides</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: understood</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: during that battle, Kim attempted to use antimatter against 682, and it didn't really work, somewhat thankfully. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE ANTIMATTER BOMB MADE HIM FART</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anti-anti-matter? I have no idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (is anti-anti-matter even a thing???) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anti-anti-matter is just regular matter though isn't it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 682 adapts to most things that attack it, I believe was the cause.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's what annoyed me about that one episode of Lilo and Stitch: The Series...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: But it worked out well enough in the end.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This brings me back to my question from earlier</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: How is life for you players now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: flip-flopping between endlessly boring and impossibly dangerous. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what SJ said, basically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Odd description</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I've also been pestering people in other universes. recently talked to what seemed to be a Pre-Scratch version of Kat...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: waithwat? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Really? Wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. it was... really awkward for both of us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even though I didn't mention what happened to our version of her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's impressive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But my life has been actually pretty good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This is good news</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Besides assisting in the release of like, 6 ancient horrors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, besides that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Life seems to be a very interesting road for you players</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (("His sources include [blah blah blah], and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage." THIS SHOW I CAN'T EVEN))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I honestly kinda fucked up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I believe you may be able to find a way to help yourselves through the issue</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's what we were doing at the Library today.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Then you have already started</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually we got maps and a new lead! Which is nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I still have your webcam Niki, recorded some good stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sweet ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am glad that it seems to be going well</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't remember the name since I only saw it for a second but I bet PE has the lead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's good to hear</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So we'll save Gene yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am wishing you luck</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am unsure if I would be useful by entering</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not, Iunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Would it inconveniance you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no strong feelings one way or the other.</span><br />
