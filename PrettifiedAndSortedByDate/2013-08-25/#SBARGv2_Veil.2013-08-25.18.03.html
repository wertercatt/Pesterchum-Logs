[06:03:33] It has been caught.<br />
[06:03:41] It is, incidentally, made of fire.<br />
[06:03:50] The narration hopes you enjoy fire.<br />

The purple aura flares adn with a mighty heave Judge tosses the flaming sphere away towards the Veil. --</span><br />
[06:05:05] <span style="color:#2b0057">CWE: *if DS is in that are he should probably watch out?*</span><br />
[06:05:09] Actually, he's not close enough to see AG-- she cannot be seen. WE, on the other hand...<br />

[06:10:01] No, DS.<br />
[06:10:13] You /don't/ see her-- she's /not able to be seen/.<br />
