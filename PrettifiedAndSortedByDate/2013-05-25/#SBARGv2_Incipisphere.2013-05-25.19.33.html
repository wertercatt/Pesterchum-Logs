<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 1/10 uses makes you smell like french fries</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi FI</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you figure out how to arrow keys yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, I think I'm gonna be sick... went on a culinary alchemy binge using every food ingredient I've captcharoided on Prospit. at least I don't have to worry about hunger for a few days :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or how to shot web</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (("how to arrow keys"? oh right, the denizen lair tile puzzle))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: *burp*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Anything delicious?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, I could do this all day. The look on their faces when all the 7 particles fly off... priceless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I went through every recipe in the Sburb Cooking Guide... and the guy is right, his chili recipe kicks ass</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (( <a href='https://archiveofourown.org/works/394694'>https://archiveofourown.org/works/394694</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: literal or figurative?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: currently figurative, but probably literal in a few hours when I visit the load gaper...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: DID NOT NEED TO KNOW</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: @ _@</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, don't try making OhGodCola. it explodes right off the alchemiter no matter how few cans you use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh right, like those colanades I made a while ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, is it possible to captchalogue before explosion?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: if you've got a time-slowing ability like Veil of Mist, maybe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I think the game's instability means the delicate superposition can't be sustained for more than five game-ticks or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So we have no way to know how delicious it is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's actually not meant to be drank, it's more of a weapon. exploding soda.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ceca54">CURRENT fortuitousSleuth [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  exploda</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: but since it's alchemized from your soda of choice (1x can and 6x cans), I assume it tastes the same as said cola</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's like my cola grenades without the reliability</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: sadly, I couldn't find a download link for "gamerGourmet's custom cookalizer firmware", so no epic bacon :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a tragedy</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay RS you're not actually coming here right</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: 7LAPPPPPP</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: P</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not right now probably</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Attacking for the last hour, thats what.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You could probably just tell them to go away and they would</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Kill them all with a bombing run</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Couldn't. bomb  consort village they were besieging.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was joking but that's wonderfully coincidental</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: hmm. just realized I've never seen any underlings in my land's consort villages ever. probably because of my consorts' "explosive" personalities <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I haven't seen that many underlings, but the consorts took care of the one or two I saw</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now that I have consorts that is</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...underlings?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Imps and their ilk</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ah. kay</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: .</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: .</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ah, hey, does anyone have those gravity rings or whatever CS repurposed for training?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just the rings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I wanna try and make something</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a bad idea but no I don't have them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No it's actually a good idea I've got an idea in mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: What ya gonna try and make?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let you know once its done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Unspoken plan gurantee, y'know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have that same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: you mean not saying what your plan is until after the fact?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hell yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I think Way-In-The-Future Me is doing the same thing to avoid the "Time Can Be Rewritten, But Not If You've Read It" effect...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: not telling me the circumstances around his self-prototyping with Ammysprite, to avoid making that specific sitch predestined</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (though the fact that he told me about the self-proto in the first place means the event is now predestined, but the details of it aren't)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I probably shouldn't have been able to do that, should I've.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: do what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Will a message from the future into existance, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Inducing a bootstrap paradox is something I figure you'd need to be a Time player to do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or figure now. Maybe the reason I could do it was I didn't know I shouldn't've been able to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: well, Karkat bootstrapped a hell of a lot of things in his memos, and he's a Blood player...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: and Sollux (Doom) was the one who created the transtimeline-memo feature to begin with</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: paradox space is made of paradoxes, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: especially bootstraps</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But its like, the difference between locking yourself into certain actions via time memo irresponsibility, and.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so while Time players may have +5 to temporal instinct, they're not the only ones who can figure out how to poke the timey-wimey ball</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I should've died. Barring anything, I would've. But I didn't because of a message I was only able to send back to myself because it saved my life and the more I think about it the more I unwrap my mind around it a little more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: well, I did make that stable-loop-theory post a few days ago, specifically talking about warnings-from-the-future with no apparent cause... which sounds like what happened to you <a href='http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51178224362/stable-time-loop-theory-a-light-players-perspective'>http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51178224362/stable-time-loop-theory-a-light-players-perspective</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Question:</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What is a bootstrap</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, in HS, "[S] Dirk: Save Everyone" is actually a bootstrap paradox too, albeit actional instead of informational</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Bootstrap paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Essetially something causing itself chronologically</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: NV: "pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps", basically a stable loop with no actual "origin"</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What's the difference between that and a temporal causality loop</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: In Blazblue Ragna's sword and his whole Bloodedge identity are a bootstrap paradox</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ragna takes up the sword, Blood-Scythe, and the surname Bloodedge, as homage to an unknown hero who helped his mentor out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But he was the unknown hero or whatever the hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: another example, in futurama: Fry is his own grandfather (technically a subtrope, but related concept)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Except at a point in the story he ends up getting sent back in time, developing amnesia. So yeah he's that hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He inspires himself, who then goes back in time to inspire himself and so on. His sword's like the best example of that: 'Cause of that timey-wimey craziness, it has no origin</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay I'm almost 100% sure that's a temporal causality loop and everything makes sense then</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Pretty much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: God damn your slang confuses the science in me</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher's <span style="color:#005500">[CCP'S]</span>  thinkpan hurts --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I once wrote a 200 page book on time travel during a week trapped in a village locked in time</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You won't believe me but I was there</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was theeeere</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Cool story bro</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: tell it again</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That'd cause a loop</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If I had that book with me I would make some kinda Time Hero's for idiots 101</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe that was a really bad vacation combined with lots of go-pills</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Who knows?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I induced a bootstrap without timetravelling or anything just through sheer force of win</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: *will</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((sheer force of win works better :P))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((ahahaha i realize this))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: actually that might work too</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I guess you'll have to adventure with me more</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And thank you for calling me Doctor</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But in all actuality it's more likely something based on your aspect or this virus than Lambency</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But..what's your planet again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: What's going on?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: SP seems to have developed cracks that glow yellow in his face</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nico was messin' with him and telling him he's got some disease from Gears of War but yeah, like he said more likely 'n not its something to do with his aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What virus were you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like referring to the glitch as a virus because it makes more sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh.</span><br />

<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Well you can stop looking to the clouds for anwsers and some investigation yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yeah, don't bother with the clouds. a few weeks ago, I had Code Observer set up a recording system pointed at Skaia to see if there's a pattern, but it's nothing but blue noise...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean, it doesn't even say "gotcha" or anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: I've stopped listening to the Horror terrors for my own good</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: there's some random partial images from time to time, but not really anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: and then there was that one day Skaia's cloud generator seemed to be pulling from The Foundation's entire database of visual memetics... oh frogs that was bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: dreamselves seem to be mostly immune to memetic hazards fortunately, as are carapaces (their brains don't work the same as humans, and dream logic prevents the meme from taking hold)</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Like how the Horrorterrors have even said positive things</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: are you saying they are taking information from just about everywere?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Well are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: sorry, was afk (freaking imps)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: idk for sure... but I think the import statement for both sources was changed to "import everything all;"</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Don't think I've worken up my dreamself yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: HAH</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's also possible for your dreamself to be "awake" but without you realizing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: before entry, for the longest time I figured this was the case for me... my dreamself was sleepwalking and staring at the clouds, and I'd subconsiously remember the visions but pass it off as deja vu</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((which, by the way, is my actual IRL headcanon for deja vu))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I feel so τired...</span><br />
