[04:18:13] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Hello</span><br />
[04:18:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: could someone bring me a toothpick so I have something to defend myself with?</span><br />
[04:18:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that /isn't/ oversized?</span><br />
[04:18:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait why? ➜</span><br />
[04:18:38] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: just burst into flames like usual</span><br />
[04:18:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: A_D ➜</span><br />
[04:18:55] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: What?</span><br />
[04:18:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um... my powers don't work right now.</span><br />
[04:19:02] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Scares me.</span><br />
[04:19:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, what did you do? ➜</span><br />
[04:19:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hell I can't even fly.</span><br />
[04:20:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I drank a potion.</span><br />
[04:20:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#baba00">CURRENT atomicEagle [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:20:09] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: This is all too funny.</span><br />
[04:20:12] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: was it spiked? ➜</span><br />
[04:20:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: apparently it was messed up.</span><br />
[04:20:22] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: This is all /too/ funny.</span><br />
[04:20:25] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Oh my god.</span><br />
[04:21:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a potion could be any "a potion" ➜</span><br />
[04:21:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes Brad, from anyone elses position I am sure this is hilarious.</span><br />
[04:21:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um... that Magic Anon potion</span><br />
[04:22:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, who did you lose a bet to? ➜</span><br />
[04:22:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh, right, you were out cold.</span><br />
[04:23:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (fucking timetravel)</span><br />
[04:23:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, what does time travel have to do with being knocked out? ➜</span><br />
[04:24:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, you kinda told us to knock you out.</span><br />
[04:24:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...okay then? ➜</span><br />
[04:25:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah after space trip was forced, Ash kinda got upset, and I over reacted... I might have mentioned someone I shouldn't of.</span><br />
[04:26:02] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I still don't know that story.</span><br />
[04:26:09] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Anyone willing to explain?</span><br />
[04:26:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh... ➜</span><br />
[04:27:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah, after that, Ash got even more upset, and I understood that I fucked, and decided to go back.</span><br />
[04:27:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nearly everyone on the ship tried to stop me.</span><br />
[04:28:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I ended up flaring instead of taking the transportalizer and then Brad told me to get out, which then I was bullheaded and just sat down... and after ripping out my heart once, I drank the potion, which seemed to have bugged up... so now I'm 3 inches tall.</span><br />
[04:29:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And now all my weapons are incredibly oversized. So could someone /please/ bring me a toothpick?</span><br />
[04:29:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
[04:29:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can't leave you alone for one minute, can I? ➜</span><br />
[04:29:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how about a sewing needle? ➜</span><br />
[04:30:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that would be needlekind, not spearkind.</span><br />
[04:30:13] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: You could tie a pebble to it</span><br />
[04:30:21] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: a sharp pebble</span><br />
[04:30:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#722881">CURRENT awesomeSwordfish [CAS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:30:40] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: ((ohgodimdyinghere))</span><br />
[04:30:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((:b))</span><br />
[04:31:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well I guess I could help you guys thread needles right now.</span><br />
[04:31:57] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: shrug ➜</span><br />
[04:32:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah I guess PW is captain now</span><br />
[04:32:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since I won't be able to push the buttons.</span><br />
[04:33:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...if my shades get broken I'm up shit creek without a paddle.</span><br />
[04:34:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus I'm worried that since I can't fly, god tier revival might not work right now.</span><br />
[04:34:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so basically I'm tiny and vunerable for who knows how long.</span><br />
[04:38:19] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: looks like you need to use your hands</span><br />
[04:38:35] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: cause you dont got a paddle.</span><br />
[04:38:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[04:38:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its figurative.</span><br />
[04:39:01] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: use your hands charles</span><br />
[04:39:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I have a couple raw numbers still. Maybe you could use 1? ➜</span><br />
[04:39:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's pretty small ➜</span><br />
[04:39:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (they're ➜</span><br />
[04:39:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: * ➜</span><br />
[04:39:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I guess a 1 would be hooked at the end and thus pretty deadly.</span><br />
[04:40:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually, could you see about replicating them? I think they would be rather fragile.</span><br />
[04:40:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm gonna try that. Not sure it it'll work though... ➜</span><br />
[04:41:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((darn it, now to check the logs to see if raw numbers were grid-compatible...))</span><br />
[04:42:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( lets just say you end up replicating look alikes. ))</span><br />
[04:42:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (( "-- FUTURE shinyJiggly [FSJ]  technically number magic over here :b --" ))</span><br />
[04:43:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( okay, so it won't work. ))</span><br />
[04:43:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...plus I want an excuse for FL to fight with a toothpick. ))</span><br />
[04:43:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((heh))</span><br />
[04:44:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( "OW MY EYE" ))</span><br />
[04:44:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lets see, we don't need to worry about falling damage due to the square cube law and FL's boots... ))</span><br />
[04:44:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um.... does anyone know where the replicator is on the ship? ➜</span><br />
[04:45:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And FL has his shades on right now, so unless those break, he should still be able to access the memo. ))</span><br />
[04:45:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay then))</span><br />
[04:45:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( If he /really needed to/ he could use the chip. ))</span><br />
[04:46:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( He would need to use the strifekind theme then though. ))</span><br />
[04:46:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( To prevent Zalgo Crashes. ))</span><br />
[04:46:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I think I found it. How do I scan stuff? ➜</span><br />
[04:46:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: um...</span><br />
[04:47:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does the touch screen say?</span><br />
[04:47:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is there an advanced menu in the lower right?</span><br />
[04:47:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it says the usual thing when you haven't touched anything yet. ➜</span><br />
[04:47:57] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's see here... ➜</span><br />
[04:48:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think so? ➜</span><br />
[04:48:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, tap on it.</span><br />
[04:48:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should be an option to scan an item.</span><br />
[04:49:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, found it ➜</span><br />
[04:49:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, stick the jar of numbers on the pad thing? ➜</span><br />
[04:49:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[04:50:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should manage to scan it without destroying it.</span><br />
[04:50:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, it's doing the scanny thing now. ➜</span><br />
[04:51:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how long does it usually take? ➜</span><br />
[04:51:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anywhere from 5 seconds to 5 hours.</span><br />
[04:52:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: depends on if it uses molecules that are familar or not.</span><br />
[04:53:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might not be able to replicate some things, but if you need to, you can force a "most close fit"</span><br />
[04:53:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, it says it's done, but it also says "10 errors found". ➜</span><br />
[04:54:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah, it does that when its an item that doesn't follow standard physics</span><br />
[04:54:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: aka magic items</span><br />
[04:55:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm gonna see what it does when I try to replicate from the scan data. ➜</span><br />
[04:56:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaaand, it replicated an empty jar. ➜</span><br />
[04:56:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: great. ➜</span><br />
[04:57:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you sure there isn't any stuff at the bottom?</span><br />
[04:57:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me check... ➜</span><br />
[04:58:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((the numbers are primarily energy-based, what would that do?))</span><br />
[05:00:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( is there any matter in the numbers at all? ))</span><br />
[05:00:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((probably not))</span><br />
[05:01:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I was going to say if so, the bottom of the jar would be filled with dust. ))</span><br />
[05:01:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( so yeah, its empty then. ))</span><br />
[05:01:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((ah, okay then))</span><br />
[05:02:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I shook the thing, it's pretty darn empty. ➜</span><br />
[05:03:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay then.</span><br />
[05:03:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: can't replicate numbers.</span><br />
[05:03:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Jars seem to be fine though.</span><br />
[05:03:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was worth a shot. ➜</span><br />
[05:03:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, it gave us valuable information.</span><br />
[05:04:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if it worked perfectly, we wouldn't have learned anything about the numbers, right?</span><br />
[05:04:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so. ➜</span><br />
[05:10:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so anything else you wanna try to replicate?</span><br />
[05:10:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm starting to think I should save some filespace on the Ring Server for replicator information.</span><br />
[05:11:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: password protected, but there.</span><br />
[05:12:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That way all of our replicators will be linked.</span><br />
[05:15:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that sound like a good idea</span><br />
[05:15:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
[05:15:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (fucking enterkey)</span><br />
[05:18:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((back from lunch))</span><br />
[05:19:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think that might beuseful ➜</span><br />
[05:19:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *be useful ➜</span><br />
[05:20:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I'll work on it when I get back to normal.</span><br />
[05:20:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...since I don't wanna be anywhere around the mountain at this size.</span><br />
[05:21:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: o_o</span><br />
[05:21:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, don't want to get eaten by anything. ➜</span><br />
[05:25:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, could I have something to defend myself with soon?</span><br />
[05:31:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe not the toothpick, someone might see it and not me.</span><br />
[05:31:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at least, knowing /my/ luck.</span><br />
[05:32:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which Kimura said was pretty bad.</span><br />
[05:32:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (course he later said it was broken so I don't know)</span><br />
[05:39:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...idea!</span><br />
[05:39:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what is it this time ➜</span><br />
[05:39:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There might be a few drops of the potion left over.</span><br />
[05:39:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could you see about replicating a tiny bottle so I can get the drops?</span><br />
[05:40:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, is there a resize option on this thing? ➜</span><br />
[05:40:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay maybe not the best idea</span><br />
[05:40:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /don't/ try to scale it yet.</span><br />
[05:40:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would be very, very bad.</span><br />
[05:40:54] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll take your word for it. ➜</span><br />
[05:41:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically the shock of the bottle rapidly expanding into its normal size would likely cause it to shatter.</span><br />
[05:41:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know this from watermelons.</span><br />
[05:41:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even if it were a plastic water bottle? ➜</span><br />
[05:42:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would still expand.</span><br />
[05:42:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: due to the current resize option using the same amount of matter and just compresssing the space.</span><br />
[05:42:44] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />
[05:42:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: simple to script, but incredibly useless.</span><br />
[05:43:16] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Keep on rock'n me baby.</span><br />
[06:03:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...why do I keep making things worse?</span><br />
[06:03:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no idea. ➜</span><br />
[06:34:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Brad, please don't untie the strings, okay?</span><br />
[06:34:54] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Sure.</span><br />
[06:35:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...are you going to find a loop hole?</span><br />
[06:35:36] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Probably not.</span><br />
[06:35:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, thanks.</span><br />
[06:35:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What are you doing on that Earth anyways?</span><br />
[06:36:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Getting locked in cells by Area 51 goons?</span><br />
[06:36:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: F_L ➜</span><br />
[06:37:44] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I dunno if you realized, but my presence at the bar would indicate I had a change of heart.</span><br />
[06:37:53] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I couldn't find what I was looking for.</span><br />
[06:37:59] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Or rather, I was too late.</span><br />
[06:39:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
