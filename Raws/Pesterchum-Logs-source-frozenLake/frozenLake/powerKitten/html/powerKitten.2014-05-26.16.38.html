[16:40:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: (( Real Land is launched out of decaying session, and sinks into an empty bubble. ))</span><br />
[16:41:04] <span style="color:#007200">PK:  :3 (( why would it get launched out of the session instead of just landsploding or something?)) :3</span><br />
[16:41:18] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: (( Its not from the SBARG session. ))</span><br />
[16:44:59] <span style="color:#007200">PK:  :3 (( no I mean normally lands explode or something not pachoo out into the ring)) :3</span><br />
[16:46:05] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: (( That would be the case, if the explosion of skaia didn't knock it out of the session. ))</span><br />
[16:47:30] <span style="color:#007200">PK:  :3 (( due to being in the ring, a high enough force such as a skiaiasplosion would cause the land to never stop moving)) :3</span><br />
[16:48:02] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: (( And thus, everything would be moving relative to it. ))</span><br />
[16:48:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: (( Nothing is truely stationary in the ring, or in space... they all are moving somewhat ))</span><br />
[16:49:36] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: (( So it moving so it slowly sinks into a bubble moving at a similar rate then getting trapped inside would not be farfetched. ))</span><br />
