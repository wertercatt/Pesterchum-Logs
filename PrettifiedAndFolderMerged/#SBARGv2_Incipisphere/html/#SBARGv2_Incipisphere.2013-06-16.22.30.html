<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah... I think, I have a good idea the main attraction in Baithos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For now I'm plumbing as many dungeons as I can, getting as many artifacts and other assorted loot. The artifacts are like turn-ins.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Good Luck, RS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Baithos is the second sector of my land, or what I've taken to calling it</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Apparently once I finish this next dungeon, it's gonna open up more dungeons in myland. howevr, gonna have to face the heartlessone to do so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The underwater city inhabited by the Ancients long ago. Nowadays its abandonned, save for the consorts that took up residence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: They're trying to figure out the place's secrets and of course that requires lots of artifacts from the dungeons throughout the place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Neat!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Haha, you'd think so wouldn't you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I mean...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The area is banzai, yeah. The residential area's least flooded over and even that's a marvel... And then getting deeper in, where things gradually get lower but the water level doesn't to compensate...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Undersea ruins like you wouldn't believe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Sounds cool looking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Sounds awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Underwaτer ruins, huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tablets are the hottest things...Journals of back when the place was still a mecca and flourishing, its hardest to come by, most of the time guarded by nasties, but the reward's well worth it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A bit of insight into these 'Ancients'...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And rare loot for showing them to my consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That main attraction I was talking about earlier, the largest structure in the land... It's locked off, from what I can tell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: All the entrances are collapsed, any improved entryway's similarly locked...It's basically inpenetrable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And chances are its where I've gotta go</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: eiτher τhis is a denizen forτress or someτhing</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Maybe. I don't really think so, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's a weird gut feeling...I could be totally wrong, but, I don't think its his keep.</span><br />
