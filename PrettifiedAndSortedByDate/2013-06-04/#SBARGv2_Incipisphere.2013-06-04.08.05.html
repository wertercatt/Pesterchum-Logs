<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, when are we gonna get our quest beds fixed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm beginning to wonder when I can prepare to end chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its not a matter of if anymore. Because we will end him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are not going to let another person die because of him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most people just say 'When'.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: fuck yes we will</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: People.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I want you all loaded with your best defensive gear, and your dreamself on crypt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because even if we die, it doesn't matter if its a heroic death UNTIL we are god tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So the heroic death can still make us god tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I want everyone wearing Single HP retention gear as well as health regen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps even more than one Focus Sash, as I have been doing lately.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except for the high grist cost, its worth it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the fact that each one only works once... per battle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff660d">CURRENT squealingVermin [CSV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: First off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Essentally only once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I have four Astral Pouches (basically Life Shrooms, but restoring to max HP). that good enough?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This enemy fights with time and space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I suggest finding something that avoids being erased from existance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: an anti-pumpkin?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Kinda.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...SCP-682?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SV, I'm not sure what would be worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Pumpkin &amp;&amp; (Cream Pie ^ Matter)... == Anti-Pumpkin? problem is getting the code for a pumpkin... and for generic matter...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (("^" is XOR, for those who aren't coders))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Why did that need to be OOC? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((habit?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, what's the ^ thing for</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((there, now a reason to explain it IC))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically, it means "|| the two things, then remove the bits they have in common"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Are you suggesting we work with exponential values?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, XOR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, so the pumpkin code can be laserstationed if you get the captcha card in the machine fast enough...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but there's still the problem of "how do you get the code for just plain matter?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hydrogen XOR Anti-Hydrogen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except we shouldn't be messing with antimatter... unless everyone agrees this would be worthwhile.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: If you could get a stabilized form of antimatter, and only if that is possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's more of the concept of "anti-" that needs to be applied to the pumpkin, and it's the only way I can think of</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Binary NOT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean "!Pumpkin"? wow, why didn't I think of that in the *woof* first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still, how to get a pumpkin to begin with</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Simple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We wait until the period of time they stop vanishing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: October 31st.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT issunJar [CIJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Of course, the one day of the year they're stable!</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: But... how would we last that long? Unless you mean sending a Time player back to LAST Halloween...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now we just need to stay alive for almost 5 months...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but didn't we already get a bunch of pumpkins from last halloween already?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't think we still have them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either way, we need to wait for one thing or another.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Yeah, but they're already gone. Bakagami's code-hacking machine ate them all as fuel, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I mean like, they'd wind up paradoxifying or something if we went back to get them</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: To think of it if we did go back and paradoxify them that'd be a pretty good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It might make them more stable and immune to the paradox's Chronos could throw at us</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...do ghost images stay stable?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...guys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, not really. remember when Jade first started using the Pictionary Modus?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ghost images tend to explode</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, better questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: question*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait here's an idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We put the slime in like, bullets or some shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How LONG do ghost images of pumpkins last?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Until the laws of physics kick in </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So all of a second maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: about as long as the pumpkins themselves do; a minimum of one panel and a max of when Paradox Space notices them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So we need to wait until october, or make some sort of quantum superposition weapon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Or, like I said, send a Time Player back to captcharoid and WRITE DOWN the code for a pumpkin from last Halloween...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As Pumpkins exist in a quantum superposition, the opposite would likely be an object that is held together from quantum effects...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like SCP-682 after the test with SCP-536.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I think I've managed to enhance my Gravity Dislocator.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It should be able to contain massive ammounts of gravity in a field now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we can for example, drop a black hole on chronos then contain it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Either that, or we try a void+time or time+void fraymotif on him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Lock him in time or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What about a Void+Void+Time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: How about just Void+Void+Void and remove him from existance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that aspect powers can double up in this session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think it would be that easy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: question is, how does aspect damage typing work in this game? can Time affect Time, or Breath versus Breath?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, there is a chance that he has managed to capture another aspect for himself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or are they all self-immune?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But from the way the aspects line up, the only extra aspect he could have... is void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, Worse case scenario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I do know some aspects are opposites, like Light and Void...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He has Space, Time, AND Void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so if he is a Douche of Space and Time AND Void, I'd deal *and* recieve automatic Super Effective against him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We can't let him into another session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we do, he may have four aspects then, and we won</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 't be able to stop him them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, lets see, what are our current plans?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1. Drop him into a black hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2. Window intersection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3. ANTIMATTER.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 4. Everything that is on the not to alchemize list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How about the fabled time/space punch</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: doesn't that only dislocate and not remove?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 5. Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was thinking more of the Ark Gurren's punch</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But Super Tengen could definitely work better</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What happens when you do the Ark Gurrens punch with Super Tengen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You punch straight outside of the known universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#aaaa7f">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what are you fools doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We can do it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Planning how to kill Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...define the plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: All we need to do is get a fraymotif that involves every single person in the session as a combo move</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And then we'll be able to make Super Tengen Toppa Sbarg Lagann</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...problem. thats impossible. some of the people in this session are perma-dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They live on on our backs and in our hearts *O*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Unless they were assholes and then good riddance</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some of them were nice people...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why do you think he said UNLESS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: NV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Please, think of what you say before you spew it out of the gaping chasm which is your mouth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The majority of them were good people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Ya kay, SV?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...however, for the people that WERE jerks... well, I still feel bad. They didn't deserve /that/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's just drop the subject, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, where are we gonna get pumpkins?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what pumpkins</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I swear to god if another person makes that Joke I will smash a pumpkin on there head when I can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we could try stealing them from Chronos a couple months ago before they ran out, but then he'd probably pull that "I see you" thing and take us out then and there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would be best to wait about 5 months.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...I was completly serious, FL. what pumpkins.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: You know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We could do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We would not even make a paradox with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, we are planning to use binary not on pumpkins so he can't wipe us from time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Just think about it. we notify our past selves about this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Thats not the only thing we have to be worried about, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then we fuck over this timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And slay chronos when he was still weak, or we run the guardian release code earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SV, we are not doing this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would DIE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, get wiped from existance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Had a bad thought earlier, about what FL is doing with the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I mean, cronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL =/= Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I misspelled. sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The best plan is to tell our past selves to send us the code, saying we need the pumpkin for shinanigans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And tell them NOTHING ELSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, this needs to be a forgetful person...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a person who remembers giving the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or we hop about 5 months into the future and grab the code for a pumpkin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Anyways, why did Cronos need the codes relating to aspects?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh god.</span><br />
