<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maximum*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Some of our powers might not be the most useful in a solo combat situation anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but at the same time some of them /are/</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: like as maid of life most of my abilities suck for 1v1 combat</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ouo</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: not all tiers are created equal</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...then we should split into randomized teams of two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: incase we get passive players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but thats gonna be even more of a pain to schedule...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why don't we do both solo and team battles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  Shouldn't be too hard to schedule, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well if we team then that means we need to wait for 4 people to be available instead of just 2</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but then again, it shouldn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It shouldn't be /too/ hart.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think 1v1 would be more fun, but maybe thats me</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So make team battles /another/ event.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We need the practise -.-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats just you</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and each rung, it randomizes the players who are teamed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...lets stick with 1v1</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I'd also be interested in team battles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I have no practise with anyone outside of DL, and believe it would be a good way to meet other players and perhaps a lesson in teamwork.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to be able to learn to work as a teamwith /anyone/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: including people we don't like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It'd be really good practise not killing each other!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … or only killing the each other we're supposed to kill :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...bluh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: complicated</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nooot really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just do everyone in 1v1s.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And anyone who /wants/ to build teamwork skills can do 2v2s! :DDD</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll do both!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but lets just focus on 1v1 for now</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Why not arrange them both at the same time? If you are already compiling a list of interested blokes, it would be simpler to add names to two lists instead of going back and asking later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok, so... fl, ip, and ag are interested right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: me too i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets compile a piratepad list of everyone... then use <a href='http://www.random.org'>http://www.random.org</a></span><br />
