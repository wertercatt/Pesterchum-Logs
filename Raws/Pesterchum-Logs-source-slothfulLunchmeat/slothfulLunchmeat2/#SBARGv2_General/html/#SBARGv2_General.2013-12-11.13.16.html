<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (i did /horribly/ on the oral portion though)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (she asked where the library was and i told her where the bookstore was)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (/incorrectly/)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (ouch)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh man, giving directions is always a pain. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so its some sort of moleman library i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I remember the oral portion of my finals... fortunately, the way Masako-sensei set it up was that, she gave a list of questions and we wrote and had her check the answers over /in advance/, then the oral itself was that she'd ask randomly chosen questions and we'd have to answer from memory.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well she at least let us answer in english and get most of the credit but</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm guessing yours was entirely on-the-fly...</span><br />
