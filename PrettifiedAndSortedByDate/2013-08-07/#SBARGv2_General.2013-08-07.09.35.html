pfffft<br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, and if CP was still online, I'd thank him for reblogging this: :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EP, I'm not offline until I'm not in the chumlist.</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: lol :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Anyway, thanks CP :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Can you even get bouncers for pesterchum? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I thought bnc's were network specific. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: all I know is, half my co-workers at Fallen Moon have bouncers so I never know if they're actually online or not :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have a bouncer, which sucks in a way, since I haven't been on rizon in over a month, but if I were to go on now, I'd still be shown as logged in :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: As if I was always there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm not exactly sure what the point of a bouncer is, unless it's to keep logs even when you're not actually logged in...</span><br />
i am so hopelessly lost<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, this so very much. <a href='http://echoingbassist.tumblr.com/post/57682881137/me-right-now-every-single-time-same-yup'>http://echoingbassist.tumblr.com/post/57682881137/me-right-now-every-single-time-same-yup</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The reason I got a bnc was because my internet connection would be really inconsistent and would disconnect and reconnect like TT's and so with a bnc, I wouldn't have to worry about re-logging in and re-identifying. :&gt;</span><br />
what's a bnc?<br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: bouncer :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It keeps you identified and logged into irc even when you go offline :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so to prevent "X is already in use. Retrying with X_..." ghosting things?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Because ghosting is a pain in the ass :&gt;</span><br />
ughhh<br />
yeah that is a bitch<br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, I know a thing or two about computers after all. At least, I know a thing or two about irc. :&gt;</span><br />
