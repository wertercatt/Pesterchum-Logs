<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I guess I'm done playing Shogun 2 tonight. (may as well, since my room has to cool down before bed, and the desktop just heats it up)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: it heats up the entire room?@</span><br />
*&gt;!<br />
*?!<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. because it's an old case not designed for the fan placement of the new mobo, the only way to keep it from overheating is to run it with the side panel taken off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ever tried putting a fan infront of the place where the side panel should be</span><br />
Like a fan for cooling yourself off and such<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's more of, the holes in the case are all at the middle or lower, and to actually vent the hot air they need to be at the top of the panel, so the hot air just gets trapped in the top part</span><br />
oh<br />
if its heating up your entire room it seems like a health concern<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I know :/</span><br />
