[06:13:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: when you broke that track switcher, did you pitch in to help repair it?</span><br />
[06:13:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Sorry I murdered your family member, have a simpathy card"</span><br />
[06:14:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: or did you run off and leave those people to clean up your mess</span><br />

[06:14:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fl, you could have gotten down on your knees and begged for forgiveness</span><br />
[06:15:14] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />

[06:23:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i will drive right the hell over there and toss you in myself</span><br />
[06:23:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL is being an angsty cowardly fucktard, SL is being a proselytising moral-preacher-type fucktard, and everyone needs a drink.</span><br />
[06:23:51] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Welp. Sounds like a normal day, then.</span><br />
[06:23:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, basically.</span><br />
[06:24:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah for all I know, I might be an angry drunk then murder an entire neighborhood of consorts, that would be /great/ for the PR</span><br />

[06:24:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: every bit of it</span><br />
[06:24:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL.</span><br />

[06:24:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i never thought id say this, but you deserve to be burned at the stake by an angry mob</span><br />

[06:25:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh, do you think what he did is justifiable:?</span><br />
[06:25:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that would due wonders for the torture</span><br />
[06:25:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I think it's not actually your business, SL.</span><br />
[06:25:24] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: please, if the defense would like to make a statement, i am listening</span><br />
[06:25:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Wooo.... And FL what.</span><br />
[06:25:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: let me go fl's "im a heart player" route and point out that i am a life player</span><br />
[06:26:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tch. I'm no defense. If he'd shut the /hell/ up and quit being an angsty fucker who runs from everything, he wouldn't even be annoying.</span><br />
[06:26:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL, grow up. SL, stop preaching and playing judge-jury-executioner-too.</span><br />
[06:26:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and so when someone tells me they commited murder and then put a mockery of the victim in front of his friends and family, yeah, i get a little upset</span><br />
[06:27:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I can fix this... augh, but it would be cheating /so much/</span><br />
[06:27:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: do tell</span><br />
[06:27:32] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:27:36] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: SL.</span><br />
[06:27:43] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: It was a fucking mistake.</span><br />
[06:27:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Your upsetness doesn't give you the right to call him a sociopath-- which he /isn't/-- or start playing judge-jury. Yeah, he fucked up big time repeatedly and ran from it, but you're /not/ in fucking charge here.</span><br />
[06:27:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: that he refused to fix for /months/</span><br />
[06:27:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and he still isnt</span><br />
[06:28:09] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Get off ya bloody high horse. Before I beat you with it.</span><br />
[06:28:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And that's your problem /how/?</span><br />
[06:28:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Stop acting so holier-than-thou!</span><br />
[06:28:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Going into the code room and locating that poor consorts remaining scraps of code and try(99.9% chance this won't work) to put it together again.</span><br />
[06:28:23] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: And SL. He Thought he did FIX it!</span><br />
[06:28:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because that could have been my daughter, thats why its my problem</span><br />
[06:28:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … No.</span><br />
[06:28:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It "could have been" a /lot/ of things.</span><br />

[06:29:16] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: AH. You are A denizen of Knowledge, yes?</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you are saying that we shouldnt care about someone commiting murder if we didnt know the victim</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And unless it /specifically is/ your problem, not "/could have been/" your problem, get off your judge's stand before I help FF beat you with the holier-than-thou stick up your arse.</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Mhm. Why do you ask?</span><br />
[06:30:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And no, SL, I'm saying that it's not up to you to order him around and force your ideas of what to do on him when you're not purrsonally involved.</span><br />
[06:31:22] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Because I Really Need a Damn Drink. Or somethign that would make SL and FL shut the hell up.</span><br />
[06:31:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, FF-- chloroform!</span><br />
[06:31:40] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ugh...</span><br />
[06:31:44] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a crazy idea. Not sure if this could work out, but what if I take you back to before you captchlogued the orginal consort, making sure you take the breandead one with you, and then you do the hearty thing to take the consort's soul so that you can give it into the braindead one? ➜</span><br />
[06:31:52] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: I think that Berserker Drug had some bad side effects. Head Ache Sucks.</span><br />

[06:32:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: actually yeah sj</span><br />
[06:32:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: try that</span><br />
[06:32:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: heeheehee.</span><br />
[06:32:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what if I just switch the braindead one with the real one?</span><br />
[06:32:21] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />

[06:32:39] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Um</span><br />
[06:32:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: also that still wouldnt fix the actual problem</span><br />
[06:32:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As the braindead one was created via an 8 digit code</span><br />
[06:33:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because you would /still be replacing someone with a lobotomized version of themselves/</span><br />

[06:33:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, okay.</span><br />
[06:33:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if anything, it would be time travel simply generating information</span><br />

[06:34:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so really, all I have to do is go back to before I captchaed the poor consort for the last time... and do a switch without me noticing.</span><br />
[06:34:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I don't even need to go back.</span><br />
[06:34:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT, you were a genius.</span><br />
