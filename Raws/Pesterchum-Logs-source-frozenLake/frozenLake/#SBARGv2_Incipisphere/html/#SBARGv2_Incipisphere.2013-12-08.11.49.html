[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: since EQ isn't here</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think its safe to say</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: something's up with her</span><br />
[11:59:24] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: not sure what yet, but i'm pretty sure there's something...</span><br />
[12:00:42] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: with that said, how's everyone doing?</span><br />
[12:00:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly, we don't have solid evidence.</span><br />
[12:00:55] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: unfortunately...</span><br />
[12:01:04] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I wish i'd kept the pesterlog</span><br />
[12:01:09] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I wasn't thinking, sorry :/</span><br />
[12:01:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If only back then, I had gone against it...</span><br />
[12:01:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry, just... thinking out loud.</span><br />
[12:01:43] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Hm?</span><br />
[12:01:56] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: how can you think out loud on a computer...</span><br />
[12:02:23] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: or are you using one of those voice to text thingies</span><br />
[12:02:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When you forcefully reactivate a chip in your brain that you had deactivated.</span><br />
[12:02:54] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh...</span><br />
[12:03:42] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: still...</span><br />
[12:03:50] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I feel like she's going to do something crazy...</span><br />
[12:04:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, but without solid evidence, we won't be able to do anything.</span><br />
[12:04:37] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: we can monitor her, can't we</span><br />
[12:04:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...There are those who would say thats a bad idea.</span><br />
[12:05:05] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: It's not them i'm eager to to incriminate her...</span><br />
[12:05:14] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I just don't want her doing anything stupid.</span><br />
[12:05:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And I don't want to lose her like sogBot.</span><br />
[12:05:57] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: sogBot?</span><br />
[12:06:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But, the matter stands that... we can't /do/ anything.</span><br />
[12:06:46] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: who's sogBot</span><br />
[12:07:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...an old friend.</span><br />
[12:07:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh...</span><br />
[12:07:48] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: am I the only one who didn't know about the trust issue thing?</span><br />
[12:09:45] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: she was saying during the battle we had that she couldn't trust anyone</span><br />
[12:09:50] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I believe CP was there for that part</span><br />
[12:09:59] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FS might have been as well</span><br />
[12:14:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and yet...</span><br />

[12:18:18] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ..."aττack"</span><br />
[12:18:45] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: perhaps retaliation would have been a better word</span><br />
[12:18:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really think we need to be turning our attention to her denizen, Athena. ➜</span><br />
[12:18:59] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes</span><br />
[12:19:03] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: SJ is right</span><br />
[12:19:19] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I bothers me that she'd ever trust her denizen...</span><br />

[12:19:34] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: since she's you know... the planet boss!</span><br />
[12:19:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: especially after that one time with project omelas. ➜</span><br />
[12:19:47] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hey my denizen is acτually genuinely nice.</span><br />
[12:19:48] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: What happend?</span><br />
[12:21:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the became a guina pig for her aspect-tweaking expariments and was talked into being a mental shut-in or something weird like that. ➜</span><br />
[12:21:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that's what project omelas was?</span><br />
[12:21:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: or is that TT's denizen...</span><br />
[12:21:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first thing. ➜</span><br />
[12:21:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh</span><br />
[12:21:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that's horrifying</span><br />
[12:21:30] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Yeah</span><br />
[12:21:50] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: please tell me she at least feels BAD about it...</span><br />
[12:21:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus we lost Sogbot before that.</span><br />

[12:25:30] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I guess you do mind then...</span><br />
[12:25:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically Athena replaced Sogbot's AI with one of her own, then... deleted him.</span><br />
[12:25:42] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ?!</span><br />
[12:25:53] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh my god...</span><br />

[12:27:14] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'm afraid of what Athena's going to make EQ do...</span><br />

[12:29:38] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: .n.</span><br />
[12:29:52] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'm trying to think of what we could do</span><br />
[12:30:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because like it or not, most of us are too much of pansys to go after Athena.</span><br />
[12:30:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Including me.</span><br />
[12:30:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'm not a pansy</span><br />
[12:30:31] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: If I had some military grade backup I could easily get the job done</span><br />
[12:30:40] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I need to finish this fleet...</span><br />
[12:31:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...AC, are you... willing to kill the consorts that live there as well?</span><br />
[12:31:31] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I have my ways of dealing with them...</span><br />
[12:31:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because... thats the major problem about making an army.</span><br />
[12:31:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Collateral damage.</span><br />
[12:31:49] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'm trying to avoid total war as much as possible</span><br />
[12:32:02] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: there are two options i'm considering</span><br />
[12:32:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Problem is, thats what its going to be.</span><br />
[12:32:11] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I have τo go!</span><br />
[12:32:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: bye...</span><br />
[12:32:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[12:32:21] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: First</span><br />
[12:32:30] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I could do what I just mentioned</span><br />
[12:32:37] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but the other possibility is...</span><br />
[12:32:47] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: leading a small team in secret to athena</span><br />
[12:33:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[12:33:10] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and killing her that way</span><br />
[12:33:28] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Either way, after what you've said</span><br />
[12:33:43] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I don't think its a good idea to sit idly</span><br />
[12:33:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have some explosives that might work, but they give major debuffs to people considering you a good guy.</span><br />
[12:34:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, thats not part of the weapon itself, just peoples reactions.</span><br />
[12:34:54] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, we still need to find out exactly where she is, without getting caught, and there's still the problem of being able to out-wit her. ➜</span><br />
[12:35:18] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: is she our only mind player?</span><br />
[12:35:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
[12:35:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: CA is a Mind player too. ➜</span><br />
[12:35:47] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: class?</span><br />
[12:35:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Prince. ➜</span><br />
[12:36:03] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ooh, that's good</span><br />
[12:36:15] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: is CA particularly brave?</span><br />
[12:36:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably. He's been involved in these sorts of affairs before ➜</span><br />
[12:37:00] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: also here's a thing:</span><br />
[12:37:02] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC:  <a href='http://enderquestral.tumblr.com/post/69340420397'>http://enderquestral.tumblr.com/post/69340420397</a></span><br />
[12:37:08] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: incase you haven't seen it</span><br />
[12:37:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...AC, if you go, I'm going to go as well.</span><br />
[12:37:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we need a plan.</span><br />
[12:38:07] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FL, I have one major fear</span><br />
[12:38:33] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Athena could be trying to prevent us from going to the new universe</span><br />
[12:38:53] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: let's see... a plan...</span><br />
[12:39:19] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Could CA potenitally negate EQ's ability to sense us?</span><br />
[12:40:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe? Good luck on getting that guy to follow your orders though. ➜</span><br />
[12:40:29] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh so he's disobidient</span><br />
[12:40:44] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: is there something he cares about particularly, something that would inspire him to follow orders?</span><br />
[12:40:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no, just independant and doesn't know you. ➜</span><br />
[12:40:59] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: something that Athena could potentially destroyed</span><br />
[12:41:02] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'd guess he'd try and figure out his own plan. ➜</span><br />
[12:42:19] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ((why does FA have two blogs? :P))</span><br />
[12:43:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I think one of them is partially ooc/SCODE and the other one is v2 stuff))</span><br />
[12:43:38] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ((ah))</span><br />
[12:44:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I would actually suggest a movement to evacuate the consorts.</span><br />
[12:45:03] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that could work</span><br />
[12:45:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, we are all gods, and at this point, can take down what ever underlings they send at us.</span><br />
[12:45:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even Lich Queens.</span><br />
[12:45:37] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: i'm trying to think of a way to get them off quickly and efficiently</span><br />
[12:45:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (which I have finally managed to get to the point of one shotting some)</span><br />
[12:45:52] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think a spacer might be able to get them off and to somewhere safe</span><br />
[12:46:00] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: (nice)</span><br />
[12:46:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: any spacers who want to help us out</span><br />
[12:48:04] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: or we could get some kind of tractor beam</span><br />
[12:49:31] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I could probably disable EQ if I could reverse the ADD</span><br />
[12:49:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[12:50:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Shon is kinda flakey, NV doesn't really care, FA's probably busy with frog duties, and Brae, I'm not sure about. ➜</span><br />
[12:50:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, reverse the polarity.</span><br />
[12:50:21] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so that's one problem solved</span><br />
[12:50:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That /always/ works.</span><br />
[12:50:36] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh it was sarcasm...</span><br />
[12:51:02] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: The v5 will be the most powerful ADD as well as the smallest</span><br />
[12:51:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like how you can get a Flashlight to remove light in the room by putting the batteries in backwards!</span><br />
[12:51:24] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FL... please stop...</span><br />
[12:51:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just making a point.</span><br />
[12:51:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This isn't star trek.</span><br />
[12:51:51] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think I already know what setting I need</span><br />
[12:51:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[12:52:04] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I stumbled upon it while v1 was still in testing</span><br />
[12:52:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, uh...</span><br />
[12:52:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it explodes, its not my fault.</span><br />
[12:52:22] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: don't worry...</span><br />
[12:52:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since your basically feeding in current /the wrong way/</span><br />
[12:52:28] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Its a lot more complicated then you think</span><br />
[12:52:44] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: That's not how it works</span><br />
[12:53:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, so your telling me your battery charger can drain battery juice?</span><br />
[12:53:22] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes</span><br />
[12:53:24] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: :P</span><br />
[12:53:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: No</span><br />
[12:53:32] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but really, I think I know how to do this</span><br />
[12:53:45] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: It should be done in a manner of minutes</span><br />
[12:53:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well excuse me as I reverse the polarity of matter</span><br />
[12:54:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: @ _@ ➜</span><br />
