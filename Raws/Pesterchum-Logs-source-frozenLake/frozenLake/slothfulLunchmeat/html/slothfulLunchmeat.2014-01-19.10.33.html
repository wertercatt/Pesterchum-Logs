[10:35:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah, 26 hour days kinda make things complicated... I guess we should blame DS for that.</span><br />
[10:36:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: or we could keep using gmt like civilized fucking human beings</span><br />
[10:36:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But I figure I could actually turn this into a setup for getting the time on /multiple planets/!</span><br />
[10:36:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, its based on GMT.</span><br />
[10:36:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Sorta.</span><br />

[10:37:46] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: probably for the best</span><br />
[10:38:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah, had to account for the 414 day years and the 26 hour days.</span><br />
