[04:25:45] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Ew.</span><br />
[04:26:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What, the bread is moldy?</span><br />

[04:28:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nice try.</span><br />
[04:28:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  puts it back in there. --</span><br />
[04:29:12] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That's about what I figured from a bitch-bender.</span><br />
[04:29:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  goes back to eating her newly created toast. --</span><br />
[04:29:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  rolls his eyes. --</span><br />
[04:30:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats actually to prevent me from burning myself alive, but... you kinda have a point.</span><br />
[04:30:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads over to the couch and sighs. --</span><br />
[04:30:18] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Of course I do.</span><br />
[04:30:30] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Aww, did I hurt your feelings?</span><br />
[04:30:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  sneers, tearing the "toast" in half and waving it around like an offer. --</span><br />
[04:31:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have no idea.</span><br />
[04:31:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do I have feelings to hurt in the first place?</span><br />
[04:31:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or do I just manage to fake them?</span><br />
[04:33:01] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably faking them, why you're such a shitty firebender.</span><br />
[04:33:46] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Or at least, I figure you can shoot fire around for a reason.</span><br />
[04:34:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I fake guilt, as well... so if I were to /stop/ faking the feelings...</span><br />
[04:35:50] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: And have feelings like a normal, not idiot?</span><br />
[04:35:56] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah then I could probably hurt them a lot more.</span><br />
[04:39:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or I'm just a complete psychopath and would have no emotion... okay scratch that, my emotions are totally real.</span><br />
[04:44:12] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Naaaah..</span><br />
[04:45:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell me Emberess, how fast would you die if one of those dice was slipped into your food?</span><br />
[04:46:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would literally /rip you apart/.</span><br />
[04:46:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL. down.</span><br />
[04:46:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fine.</span><br />
[04:46:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Also Kimura, you do realize that its ironic that its coming from you, right?</span><br />
[04:47:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes. yes I do.</span><br />
[04:47:38] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: At least I can die, I mean.</span><br />
[04:47:51] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I know what that means at least.</span><br />
[04:48:03] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Y'know it's probably who I'm such a badass firebug compared to you.</span><br />
[04:48:41] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { why instead of who* }</span><br />
[04:48:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how the hell did I survive to go godtier.</span><br />
[04:49:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How did I survive that long?</span><br />
[04:49:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I remember.</span><br />
[04:49:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was because I manipulated the alchemy system to give myself an edge on the monsters. To survive as long as I possibly could.</span><br />
[04:50:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With auto regen and items that prevented a blow from taking me under 1hp...</span><br />
[04:51:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: don't feel bad FL, I kinda did that too with my badges. Emergency Point Swap, anyone?</span><br />
[04:51:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And now I realize why everything in this universe can kill me easily.</span><br />
[04:51:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because alchemy is disabled</span><br />
[04:51:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right?</span><br />
[04:52:00] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: HAH</span><br />
[04:52:02] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What a bitch</span><br />
[04:52:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah. Because I grew too used to it.</span><br />
[04:52:17] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I bet you couldn't even beat me in a sword fight, even with all those stupid swords.</span><br />
[04:52:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I thought I would never lose it, and then I did...</span><br />
[04:52:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that reminds me FL, lemme know when you fix the freaking AU Machine. I need to replicate a Door Station to put on Augataur.</span><br />
[04:53:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I thought it would never change. But then it all came crashing down around me.</span><br />
[04:53:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kimura, I don't think those can be replicated, actually.</span><br />
[04:54:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why? it seems like it's just tech-based only...</span><br />
[04:54:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unless it's the same problem as the stargate</span><br />
[04:54:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[04:55:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Basically my IC justification for preventing hypertech items from being replicated ))</span><br />

[04:55:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe you could ask Brad to spawn one in.</span><br />
[04:55:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess.</span><br />
[04:56:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And me now abusing the fact that Voiders are walking alchemiters. ))</span><br />
[04:56:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( :V ))</span><br />
[04:56:31] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Man, looks like my empire's time to shine is now.</span><br />
[04:56:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in the meantime though, I made a visit yesterday and put a remote-terminal on the Augataur-side door to turn it on or off from there, being powered by the Starter-side station.</span><br />

[05:14:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And those all end up existing.</span><br />
[05:14:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its funny, actually.</span><br />

[05:15:38] <span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: Then that just makes the percentage of what an absolute bitch you've been while being here even higher.</span><br />
[05:15:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wonder what would happen if our hotel characters visited this universe.</span><br />
[05:15:52] <span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: So how about trying to quit antagonizing everyone.</span><br />
[05:16:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would likely be pretty awkward, wouldn't it.</span><br />
[05:16:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: about as awkward as us meeting the pseudoexiles, probably.</span><br />
[05:16:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Expecially when we tried to claim that we were controlling them.</span><br />
[05:16:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually scratch that; as awkward as us meeting /our specific/ exiles.</span><br />
[05:17:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I've met PK's, he's kinda a weirdo.</span><br />
[05:17:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
[05:17:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, it would be pretty much the same, wouldn't it. Voices that claim they control us, when really they just /think/ they control us.</span><br />
[05:18:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be like Harry Potter meeting JK Rowling.</span><br />
[05:18:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, good point.</span><br />
[05:19:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be like Andrew Hussie meeting Andrew Hussie, actually.</span><br />

[05:20:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, the Pseudoexiles likely have someone writing about them, too.</span><br />

[05:21:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Likely would be some sort of shitty High School anime.</span><br />
[05:21:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pseudoexile, us, Hotel...</span><br />
[05:22:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm willing to bet that there are /multiple/ universes with them being written about.</span><br />
[05:22:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Hotel version of JK Rowling compared to our version of JK Rowling, both writing the harry potter series.</span><br />
[05:23:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might just be that in some way, shape, or form, everything is a universal constant.</span><br />
[05:24:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda sound like a nightblogger, don't I.</span><br />
