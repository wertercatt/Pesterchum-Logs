[05:50:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT ChanServ [CCC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:50:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">[#SBARGv2_General] <a href='#SBARGv2_Incipisphere'>#SBARGv2_Incipisphere</a> for IC; <a href='http://kapowcreations.com/?action=sbarginfo'>http://kapowcreations.com/?action=sbarginfo</a> for info. DISCUSSING NSFW IS AN INSTANT KICK.</span><br />
[05:50:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#133295">CURRENT existentialPenguin [CEP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:50:22] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And it would be unrealistic for someone to tell you to "just think happy thoughts" :&gt;</span><br />
[05:52:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000aa">CURRENT Noodles [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:52:16] But that's literally all most have done<br />
[05:52:16] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: A lot of people don't understand. :&gt;</span><br />
[05:52:27] Hell I think someone used those exact words last night<br />
[05:52:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have faith that things can get better for you, but I understand that this isn't just a matter of outlook :&gt;</span><br />
[05:52:44] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And that it might take a while :&gt;</span><br />
[05:54:03] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's not as simple as many people would like it to be. :&gt;</span><br />
[05:54:15] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I'm sure you too wish it were simpler. :&gt;</span><br />
[05:54:28] Yeah...<br />
[05:55:27] It seems like the longer this goes on the more people I alienate and... yeah<br />
[05:56:00] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm sorry it seems that way. I don't know whether to say that's true or not. :&gt;</span><br />

[05:56:31] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">noodles</span> can I ask a slightly personal question?</span><br />
[05:56:47] I might slightly answer it.<br />
[05:56:57] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">do</span> you have a therapist / counselor?</span><br />
[05:56:58] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">also</span></span><br />
[05:57:04] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">why</span> does slightly everyone do that</span><br />
[05:57:12] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">the</span> repeat-the-way-I-ask-if-I-can-ask-a-question thing</span><br />

[05:57:20] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: :u</span><br />
[05:57:26] No<br />
[05:57:28] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: because we're all a bunch of snarkers :&gt;</span><br />
[05:57:32] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">well</span></span><br />
[05:57:37] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span> might be a good idea to try to go to one,</span><br />
[05:57:43] ...<br />

[05:57:55] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> don't think I'm calling you weak by suggesting that</span><br />
[05:58:04] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s a common fallacy that going to a therapist or counselor is a sign of weakness</span><br />
[05:58:17] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">when</span> in reality it's just like going to a physical doctor</span><br />
[05:58:22] "Parents not wanting me to be on here to begin with" ring a bell?<br />
[05:58:25] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">right</span></span><br />
[05:58:30] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span>,</span><br />
[05:58:34] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">have</span> you tried to ask to go to one at all?</span><br />
[05:59:29] No because they would ask why and I don't have a good answer to tell them<br />
[05:59:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#887000">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:59:39] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: seriously, counselors help big-time</span><br />
[05:59:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: speaking from experience</span><br />
[05:59:49] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">patient-doctor</span> confidentiality</span><br />
[05:59:52] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Depression is a good answer. :&gt;</span><br />
[05:59:53] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Also, :&gt;</span><br />
[05:59:54] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">give</span> that as an excuse</span><br />
[05:59:56] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: You could just say :&gt;</span><br />
[05:59:57] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> yeah you should try asking</span><br />
[06:00:02] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span> might seem impossible</span><br />
[06:00:07] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> sometimes they'll bend if you ask enough</span><br />
[06:00:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: "I just feel like it would help to see one" :&gt;</span><br />
[06:00:11] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though to be honest, :&gt;</span><br />
[06:00:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm too scared to see a therapist/counselor :&gt;</span><br />
[06:00:27] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">EP</span> think of it like going to a regular doctor</span><br />
[06:00:33] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Also, no health insurance. :&gt;</span><br />
[06:00:36] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't see doctors. :&gt;</span><br />
[06:00:38] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span>'re not goNNa judge or anything based on whatever kind of mind disease you have--</span><br />

[06:00:59] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> anyway they're not goNNa judge on whatever equivalent of a disease for the mind you have</span><br />
[06:01:10] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">like</span> how a real doctor doesn't judge you for getting the flu or such</span><br />
[06:01:25] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: though, :&gt;</span><br />
[06:01:37] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: if you tell someone online in a private message that you're feeling suicidal :&gt;</span><br />
[06:01:47] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: they'll be concerned, but they won't call the cops :&gt;</span><br />
[06:01:49] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: a counselor would call the cops :&gt;</span><br />
[06:02:16] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">actually</span>.</span><br />
[06:02:23] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> you send someone a private message that you're feeling suicidal</span><br />
[06:02:27] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span>'re legally obliged to call the cops</span><br />

[06:02:56] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: ._. what if you don't want the cops being called? :&gt;</span><br />
[06:03:16] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> doesn't fix how they're essentially doing the legal equivalent of leaving you to die</span><br />
[06:03:30] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'d be the equivalent of not calling the firefighters because you want your house on fire</span><br />
[06:03:40] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">in</span> the eyes of the law.</span><br />
[06:03:52] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: well, I'm not saying I am feeling that way. Or that the hypothetical "you" is. :&gt;</span><br />
[06:03:55] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: But :&gt;</span><br />
[06:03:58] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like :&gt;</span><br />
[06:04:02] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: From experience :&gt;</span><br />
[06:04:11] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">from</span> experience they won't call the cops.</span><br />
[06:04:15] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">however</span>. that is a bad idea for them.</span><br />
[06:04:16] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: The hypothetical 'you', as in 'I',  :&gt;</span><br />
[06:04:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: No, that is not what I'm saying :&gt;</span><br />
[06:04:23] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: hold up :&gt;</span><br />

[06:05:17] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: When I/you say that they're feeling that way, they don't really want to die or kill themselves or anything like that. They just feel like they've been having those thoughts :&gt;</span><br />
[06:05:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And they want someone to talk to about those thoughts :&gt;</span><br />
[06:05:30] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">try</span> to tell your parents to let you go to a councillor or therapist</span><br />

[07:30:34] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ *Was distracted for a minute there* Yeah there were one or two instances of players having a spat ooc in scode and while generally it settled down ok that instance was particularly bad Σ</span><br />
[07:31:16] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: There was a GM defending the person who was clearly out of line.</span><br />
[07:31:18] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I just get annoyed when everyone outside of the arg sterotyped scode as nothing but drama and wrote it off as crap. :/ Σ</span><br />

[07:35:26] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Well to be fair, it was mainly an issue of miscommunication and bad blood between two specific players about something outside of the game that caused this Σ</span><br />
[07:35:51] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ They just used this as an excuse and then people jumped in without knowing what was going on Σ</span><br />

[07:37:25] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ If I remember correctly from my conversations with PM and the other person about the issue it started with some other stuff entirely and the led to the anon hate as they passive-agressively went after each other Σ</span><br />
[07:38:10] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ neither side was right (especially the one who sent teh anon hate) and I made sure to talk with them about how that wouldn't be tollerated in teh arg Σ</span><br />
