<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man... what happened...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I... have no idea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't want to know</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, now I'm curious</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: about what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a37fce">CURRENT sleepingTimetravlur [CST]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I have sunken into some emotional stress that might as well turn into the Green Sun...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: D: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, I wasn't able to find what the mysterious note was pointing to... apparently I need more carapace reputation to access that part of Prospit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: what's wrong ST? er, TT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If you need to talk, we could always have a hardcore feeling's jam at the base.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I don't think my mind is safe anymore unless I'm asleep...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: And even then I'm not even sure that I'm safe here, either....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean about that thing that you and RS were almost talking about earlier?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: Y-yeah...there's someone in my head...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: and that someone is the Denizen of my planet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: uh-oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, what kinda stuff are they saying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: are you a Mind player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: helpful stuff? harmful stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: confusing stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...Remember that time you had to rescue me?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: Mind denizens might do psychological warfare instead of physical strifing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: The state I was in?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I'm a life player, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, when you were all ink-dark and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I was under the denizen's control...in a way...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hm...what does it say?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT sherlockAdventurest [CSA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSA: those fucking snakes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: n-no.....</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: SA, quiet for a few minutes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: My denizen...I don't think she's snake-like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I...understand what you mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Does she look like a person?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sound like one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I really want to help, I'm just not sure how. It'd be nice to know something about the denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...something about...taking away human emotion...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: she's...corrupted....</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: not completely...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, that's a start. She's trying to..break you, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She's corrupted enough?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: i guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: starting to remind me of my relationship with my denizen.. though he was actually a lot nicer from the sound of it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: there's still a part of her left that's still pure...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which part reaches out to you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: and a bit of that part is...around the base...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: remember that luminous rose..?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oooh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think I understand it a bit then..</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: well...it's now a...person-like being?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#005500">[CCP]</span>  falls asleep at the keyboard... even though technically he's already asleep --</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: it's...complicated....</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait, the rose became a person?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I think...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Where is it? She?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: she's been going around purifying nearby areas....</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: s...she can't do it all by herself though, which is why...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: .....</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is why...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She needs your help?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you gotta stay strong, Kat. There's folks that need you out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ..I...I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: it's that...she told me I have to trick the voice in my head somehow and make them think I'm in cahoots with them...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: or something like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...and I don't know if I'm up to that task...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes you well, get asked to do things you might not be up to</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But even if you do mess up, the worst thing you can do is not try</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...that's the problem...IF I fail...I might...lose it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's nothing you can lose that we can't find, I hope</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: and I do descend that far...I'm not even sure that the antidote we have can save me again...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, we're here for you no matter what happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And hey, this game is all about challenges!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The game believes in you and so do we</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You can handle it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Otherwise it wouldn't have given you that quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: considering this is a glitched session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ......</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: but you're right...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the only option we have is to deal with the cards we're dealt</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And hell there's a few fully loaded decks getting your back</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ......</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: thank you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I needed to get all of that off my chest...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: any time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn it, all of a sudden I feel so hyper and almost everyone's asleep already...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm not asleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, besides you</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And you're welcome Kat, don't be afraid to ask if you need help</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: :P not like i wanted to hang out anyway, gosh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's all cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh parcelbombers I was supposed to deliver that card</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I...got something I wasn't supposed to and Rob wanted one, so I was at LoIaR to deliver it.</span><br />
