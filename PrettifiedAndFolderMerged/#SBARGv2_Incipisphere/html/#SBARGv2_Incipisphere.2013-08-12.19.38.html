<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: ...If you could jump start my second drone, that would be nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Um.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Yes I took pieces off it and It broke in the maze.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Is didnt your third drone take it apart for upgrades? Can it still work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: But the fact that there wasn't a huge explosion means that you can still jump start it... it won't be as armored though... and its gonna move /slow/</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ugh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: maybe you should just have an army of like</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ED-Es</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that guys such a tenascious little badass</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I'll bother Hannah to do so. But, it'll most likely have to wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: The boss-thing is almost done, and they are kinda distracted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: tell me when you win</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: ...how much damage did I do to it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: I would hope my hydrogen cell would do /something/</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: a fair amount, from what I could tell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: sweet</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Actually you could just rip the cell out of the downed one and /throw it/</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: I mean, I don't need the drone, but the cell makes a good explosive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: One sec...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you'd need a charge or something for it to explode</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like a blasting cap</span><br />
<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: You are right with that echo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: think of it like c4</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: doesn't explode unless you make it</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: She says "heck no" to the cell idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: -But, drone <a href='#2'>#2</a> might be going online again. Hopefully.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well unless any of you use either A. tracers B. incendiary rounds C. lasers</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you probably can't detonate the cell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: DT, check if the drone is active or not.</span><br />
