[22:10:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((between the wall of their world and ours, there is a plane where there is nothing but deminic furbies apparently))</span><br />
[22:10:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and if the wall is broken too much, they could escape and that would be a VERY BAD THING.))</span><br />

[22:12:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((hey, just because his guy in the session isn't the brightest doesn't mean you should judge him on that.))</span><br />
[22:13:10] <span style="color:#7bc536">CPK: ((and auctually the class of that forth walll breakage on my scale is that it was a level 9 breackage due to the risk factor in the dual voids, and the damage to my screen))</span><br />
[22:13:38] <span style="color:#7bc536">CPK: ((Im just saying I doubt a lot of FLMun's headcanons come true</span><br />
