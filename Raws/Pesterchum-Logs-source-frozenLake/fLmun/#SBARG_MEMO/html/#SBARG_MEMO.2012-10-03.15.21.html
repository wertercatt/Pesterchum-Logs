<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Heir of Heart eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Saving the entire land would not work, as that would cause a paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Doom is so broad and vague</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The explosion was what killed me on the quest bed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Surprisingly hard to get a good explination of the title</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: how about your own, Prince of Space? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Okie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: I have a Prince of Space character I'll be making for a story</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My land was the land of Iron and warmth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: so any insights are nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Or that. Prine of space would be cool to listen to too</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Ill mute the memo while i do it then, Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: kk</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: brb coffee</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My title actually has to do with the iron in blood, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Well, the prince is a very headstrong and active class</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: It is destruction through the aspect of choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: So as a prince os space, I would likely fling things around at high velocities to weaponize them, Changing their size as or before they hit for maximum damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or it destroys it instead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A prince of space like this would be able to defeat any monsters or denizens at ease while at god tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And now my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Frogs and fatigue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, you might be able to rip a hole in the fabric of space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: The land would be grey and morose, Slow paced, My consorts would be crabs, They would have very basic tribal-like communities too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: My planets quest to light the forge would be a giant puzzle that took up most of the planet, Yet the pieces were way too small or too large.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My consorts were Komodo Dragons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: So i would have to ascend to godhood to be able to light my forge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And then the heat and light from the forge would liven my planet up, Making it faster and more colourful, Allowing me to collect frogs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: BOOM</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: alright how about mine now</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Knight of Doom</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Always fun to lisren to these</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: i have my own theories on how my classpect works but new perspectives are always nice</span><br />

<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: K</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A knight is a defensive class.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know what is fun, but might be considered a bit twisted?</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Hard to weaponize, But mainly good for protecting yourself or others from harm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A knight of doom could be either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: They could protect their allies from doom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Or protect the doom of their enemies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Causing all of the iron in the blood to shift to one side and cause the skin to begin to "rust"</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Forcing them to be taken by their doomed fate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Without them having a say in the matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And your land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: I'd say your land would be a large and colourful land, Seemingly nice, With your consorts being a brightly coloured rodent, But all of this is "Fragrance" covering the decay of the planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, sending ALL the blood to the head to make it explode works as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: The planet would slowly be dying, From the repercussions of the rodents destroying the land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: It would become dangerous, And not a nice to place to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Your quest would be to stop and revert the effects of your consorts.</span><br />
