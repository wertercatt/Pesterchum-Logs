<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm not gonna flood it with water because hot things cooling quickly have a habit of shattering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Well, as it cools down, the problems with the heat should lessen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's why I'm doing it gently with Galestorm. windy thing instead of wet thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Considering the memo seems to have stablized, it has likely seemed to managed to repair that... you should be able to connect to other alternate universes again soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: However, there still is the issue of two deaths on our hands that we must worry about.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Why are you so afraid of death?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: It is unlikely that FL was the one that built it though, as some of the components seem to be beyond his capibilitys. Perhaps they were being built on commission.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: I will attempt to feed the energy running to the AU Machine to the rest of the mountain so the elevator doors can be opened remotely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...woops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Alright, lets try to filter some of the power off it... not nearly as much though.</span><br />
