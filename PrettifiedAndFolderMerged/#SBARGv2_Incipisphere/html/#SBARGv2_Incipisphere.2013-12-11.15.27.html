[05:10:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: 2-2 and 2-3 were not-MC at all... in fact, all of Chapter 2 was the "Big Lipped Alligator Episodes" variety...</span><br />
[05:10:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then it went back to regular stuff in Chapter 3</span><br />
[05:11:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and in 4 (which I haven't done yet), there'll be other characters and a sane plot :D</span><br />
