<span style="color:#005500">CNV: As a hypothetical question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause he's gonna get an ocelot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If I gave an ocelot cat things, would it survive?</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay, I can get fish</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: if you mean cat-food... then, in /theory,/ yes. I also have a feeling that an ocelot has something in its diet that it needs, that catfood might not give it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont get an ocelot</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have an ocelot</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh god</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: why do you have an ocelot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because somebody gave me an ocelot</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: I'm going to Google care and feeding of an ocelot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: who gave you an ocelot</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Oh, Envy! You're a medic! Do you know much about broken bones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, what do you need to know about them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also my friend Marsh thought it would be a good birthday present</span><br />

<span style="color:#447463">CAG: If a bone shatters, will it heal to be stronger, weaker, or the same in the places where it has fractured?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: depends if it sets right</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Depends</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If it gets set wrong, weaker</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If it gets set right, the same way it was before</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if it doesn't set right then it's technically weaker even if the joints are stronger where it rejoined.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: In fact, if some idiot sets it wrong and you asked me to look at it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause it doesn't support weight properly anymore</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd have to break it again to set it right</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and that might not even help</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: yeah, not fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ugh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Unless its a rib, those things heal pretty well</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why do you ask?</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Because Ash was making a shitty metaphor about bones breaking and being stronger and how that applied to the heart as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "Don't be a baby, ribs grow back! (No zey don't.)"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: And I wanted to know if she was doing it right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: o ash</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ahahaha &gt;implying ash has medical knowledge</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: pft</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Nah, just wondering what the correct answer was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you have to work a heart to make it stronger</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's a muscle</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a giant piece of specilized cardiovascular muscle</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and like</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing else</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm sure the metaphor was about love or something gushy</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is actually in your frontal lobe</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which you also have to work to make stronger</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: just in a different way</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: which is kind of cool when you think about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: breaking it creates emotional... uh. fissure's i guess is the right word</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and it's easy to fall into them again if you aren't smart about how you deal with your emotions</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The more emotional synapses you create the more neural pathways are available to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Meaning humans progressively think harder the more they think critically</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is probably the coolest thing about biology</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Besides like having organs</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: are you kidding me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Biology's amazing man I'd fucking hate to be a computer program just because biology</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: anyway nv i have the ocelot knowledge</span><br />

<span style="color:#447463">CAG: That is always the best part.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: loot usually happens at the end anyways</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: w/e</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Loot-- anything interesting that isn't both bolted down and on fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: But the kind that comes in chests usually is, yeah :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so underlings drop specibi if theyre using a certain weapon when they die, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think that's a chance drop</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: they have a /chance/ to. it's not guaranteed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: common</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uncommon</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in fact, it's pretty damn rare actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ergo it means you can but it does not mean you always will</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: can you cheat the system by giving them a certain weapon you want the specibus for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because i just alchemized a b-ball with legendary power's and i would like to have a ballkind specibus</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: why not</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: don't you have a spare specibus card?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, they have to spawn with an unallocated strife card to pick up a weapon like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we've been in the game for like</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: four months now</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i have a stack of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: closer to five actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what have you been doing</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: my land has basically nothing but swords you realize</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they drop empty cards</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and roses</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: not often</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: they usually grab a sword from somewhere and then they just drop another bladekind card</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: four-five months is enough time for not-often to become a small thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i have received 2 blank cards and already allocated both</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also SV, once you're done GMing the last part of the event I need to ask something before you disappear and our online times don't overlap again for several weeks...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you lead a sad life</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: better start grinding huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fuckin sword land</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: find a land with less swords and grind there</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: use that brain of your's man</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i know it's there</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no need to be shy</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: come on out little guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anyways</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: head somewhere else and grind levels there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: btw SL, there's also a chance to get a free specibus at certain echeladder rungs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: mind if i head over to your place for a bit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I got rosaryKind when I hit... Lv400 I think it was?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: just so i dont show up someplace uninvited like an asshole</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wait you mean my land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but it's very player-specific, just like the rung names themselves are player-specific</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sorry. it's a little... </span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Dude. Just pick an abandoned Land or something.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ?</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like when FI was attacking people?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because the common idea was to sit on our hands</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: but there were meetings</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just not huge ones</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ignorance he was complacent in but hey details right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What matters is he made a shitty post and some stupid comments acting like there was any chance people would leave him to die and not tier him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i didnt even bother fighting him :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: me either, but mostly because it would've been sudokucidal for me to try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean when he came for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Hank was probably one of the few that COULD fight Seth safely, and he /still/ got taken out in the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i knew i wasnt gonna win, so i didnt even bother</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Did not end well.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and i also didnt realize she had just tiered so</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Kind of hard to hold ignorance against somebody, again, she'll get over it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm sure she didn't get eaten by wolves but it probably sucked, so give people who just died some space</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, it seems like the main thing about it is not that her denizen killed her, but that in the process of ascending, she became part raven.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and she's trying to adjust to that, like I had to adjust when I self-prototyped</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: See what that has to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh, like, emotions or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk, just a theory</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Birds have fragile emotions Rob</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Check your human priviledge</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well i adjusted to tiering pretty easily but i didnt get crazy combined with anything so</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...It did strike me as odd, her reaction. She seems a lot more emotionally crumbly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably being tiered with Ashsprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The whole "past her" thing I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ashsprite was pretty emotionally crumbly</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the fact that shes well... a sensitive person in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So you've probably got a lot of backlash all pent up</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i deserve it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah probably. But really, she'll be fine given some hours or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or not, I'm not a psychic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: understand that i never mean to hurt people</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i like pointing out peoples flaws and kinda teasing them about it, but i do it to help them improve</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: like even if my calling her a tightass is a bit over the line, ash really does need to lighten the fuck up</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're like a less vindictive me and I find that revelation horrifying ._.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: everybody here is a flawed motherfucker, myself included</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and ive found mocking people for their flaws makes them want to prove me wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: youre welcome you ungrateful pieces of shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so you think you're doing them a favor by insulting them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: See, I used to think that. Then I realized that people, when their flaws are brought up, are far more likely to either do one of two things</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, thank you? &gt;_&gt; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 1. Curl up into a pile of sad and say "No he's wrong" until they become a shallow husk of that one flaw you pointed out</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#008141">There Are Not Enough Finish Crumbs In Paradox Space To Describe My Opinion About That</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or 2. Actively try to improve themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but if the first is their reaction, then can anything get them to change?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Far more people are number 1. so insults just become pointless bullying</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most people resist change very strongly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and it doesnt help that a lot of people have these echo chambers who tell them that theyre perfect and special and nothing needs to change</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and thats arguably worse</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah arguably. The trick is finding people who aren't like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no those people need to be sought out</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: they need to be torn away from their echo chambers and told "no, you arent perfect you arrogant piece of shit"</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: im forcing them to think about themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No you're not</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're forcing them deeper into their echo chambers</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because somebody has to</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: do you know how to get them out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because if you have a suggestion id love to hear it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's not whining at them and complaining at them with little jabs</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: People in those "echo chambers" need to come out themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: More often than not that gets done by just ignoring them unless you have any positive things to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but they never will</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: they need to be forced out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Throwing firecrackers into the hole of a baby rabbit will not force it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It will just make it scared of the outside world</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is good, because they can be eaten outside. But it's bad, because life continues on without this baby rabbit on the ecosystem</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((could you maybe ask him to recode it to work with non-pesterchum irc servers? like, strip the color codes, show handles without having to text-prefix, etc?))</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, a pesterchum coded for non-PC servers wouldn't work with the PC server, so the me-mo's irc-exclusiveness would probably stay intact...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Python is absolutely ridiculous, but you might not actually be able to do that unless you just... write a program to do it automatically. }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { I should do a gradient quirk. }</span><br />
