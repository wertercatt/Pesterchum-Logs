[04:01:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // BEARS. --</span><br />
[04:02:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  moves one of the pinned up blankets covering a window to check outside --</span><br />

[04:03:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  flares right infront of the entrance of the bar... and starts getting mauled. --</span><br />

[04:07:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  runs over, getting between FL and the random attackers, barking angrily at the latter --</span><br />
[04:07:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The bears decide to go after Kimura. After all, its not like they are about to be blown apart or anything. --</span><br />

[04:08:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // ...And the crows start pecking at FL. --</span><br />
[04:10:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  realizes pulling a Stone Mario isn't really gonna be useful, transforms back, puts up a forcefield, and flings the User's Revenge at the crows --</span><br />
[04:11:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is bleeding, but at least the crows are killed. --</span><br />
[04:12:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  uncaptchas the medigun, which he got back earlier from the clinic, and fixes the bleeding problem --</span><br />

[04:14:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  pops the charge, while looking back to make sure the bears are keeping their distance --</span><br />
[04:14:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  jolts up, pulling out two swords. --</span><br />

[04:15:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  starts spinning... and spinning... SPINSPINSPINSPINSPINSPINSPINSPIN --</span><br />
[04:16:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks, and looks at the surroundings, the last few bears fleeing. --</span><br />
[04:16:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  then passes out from all of the blood. --</span><br />
[04:16:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh.</span><br />
[04:17:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // ITS EVERYWHERE! --</span><br />
[04:17:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  picks up FL, getting him out of the trigger zone --</span><br />

[04:21:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  then draws Deluge, trying to wash the blood away with localized rain --</span><br />
[04:22:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The blood finally goes away. --</span><br />
[04:24:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also FL, since you left the skype memo currently known as "check your foot privilege", just gonna post this here: &lt;slothfulLunchmeat&gt; i mean hes dead and technically still has a lifey thing revival, maybe he used it to merge with the lifestream or whatever and just make nature hate charles ))</span><br />
[04:25:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((until further notice, this is the headcanon explanation for why nature is in spades with you))</span><br />
[04:26:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And FL is just gonna assume since its mainly crows, it must be paradox space telling him he isn't much different from prometheus.))</span><br />
[04:27:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((eh, if you say so.))</span><br />
[04:27:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues waiting for FL to snop out of it --</span><br />
[04:29:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( wait what was the memo originally? ))</span><br />
[04:30:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((the name of it tends to change fairly often))</span><br />

[04:30:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...Don't remember ever joining it. ))</span><br />
[04:31:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I think you left the memo a few days after he made it...))</span><br />
[04:31:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and I can't remember what it was called at the time, but after you left it changed to "come on and slam and welcome to azkaban"))</span><br />

[04:33:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: man, I'm wondering if you should check your house for cursed shit or something...</span><br />
[04:34:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What happened?</span><br />
[04:34:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I heard there was bears...</span><br />
[04:34:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bears, yes. very yes. also crows</span><br />
[04:35:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, So I take it the crows pecked me to unconsiousness or something?</span><br />
[04:37:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably</span><br />
[04:37:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is there something you aren't telling me?</span><br />
[04:38:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  casts a suspicious look on Kimura. --</span><br />
[04:38:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "probably" as in "either that, or you fainted from the blood pile"</span><br />
[04:38:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...which I already cleaned up, don't worry</span><br />
[04:38:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...blood pile?!</span><br />
[04:38:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WHAT?!</span><br />
[04:39:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh.</span><br />
[04:40:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what happened.</span><br />
[04:40:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: crows, bears, Cube Wisp, forcefield, slicey dicey, blood fainting, Deluge, the end.</span><br />
[04:42:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I assume I did the slicey dicey?</span><br />
[04:43:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah.</span><br />
[04:43:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And since I don't see any bodies, I assume I sliced so much that it caused them to turn into a fine mist.</span><br />
[04:54:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm heading into the bar.</span><br />
