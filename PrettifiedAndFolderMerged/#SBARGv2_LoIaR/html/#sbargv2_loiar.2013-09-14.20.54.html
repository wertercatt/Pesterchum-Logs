<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  has smoothed his expression out into something more neutral.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  notices the danger in time, letting himself get run through in the side, dropping the club, and trying to puch IP sqaure in the face. --</span><br />
