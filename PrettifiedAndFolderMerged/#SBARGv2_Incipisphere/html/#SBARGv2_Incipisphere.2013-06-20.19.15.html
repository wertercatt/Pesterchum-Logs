<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SP, I have an idea, but its risky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda found the code for the golden apple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: GoldeN ApplE YoU SaY?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: ThE ApplE OF DiscorD?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, from Super Paper Mario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, not THAT one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: i Don'T ThinK i KnoW ThaT OnE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty much, it puts the one who eats it to sleep until they get a black apple</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: InterestinG</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and what's really dangerous about it is, it overrides normal dreamself/realself waking attempts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: for example, if the dreamself eats it, the realself can't fall asleep at all. and vice versa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: WhaT AbouT DreambotS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, is there a clause for that written out somewhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: assuming it works like Jade's bot, that the dreambot is awake when the dreamself is, it should still be the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: OK, I'lL GivE IT a TrY. DO YoU AlsO HavE ThE "BlacK ApplE" ThaT CaN UndO ThE EffectS OF ThE GoldeN OnE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: aT7OFDzE and dj7OFDzE for the Gold and Black apples.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: AlrighT. I'lL GivE IT a TrY AnD ReporT BacK ON HoW IT WenT</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: please be careful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CSP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know what would happen if both waking and dreaming selves at the apple, so be careful-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DAMMIT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there are some forces that shouldn't be meddled with...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, both codes have --7OFDzE in common. I wonder what could be made by changing the first two digits...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably the other weird apples</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I don't think we should try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just figure it would be dangerous.</span><br />
