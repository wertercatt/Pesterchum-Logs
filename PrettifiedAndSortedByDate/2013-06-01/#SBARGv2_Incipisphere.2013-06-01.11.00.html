<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Your text color changed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is that important?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Not really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It probabely will again at some point, but that gray was really god damn depressing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Its just, yeah, text changing usually indicates something, good or bad (most times bad)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (sometimes good though!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((pft))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't know sometimes it could be good</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah I know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't know if becoming part dog is necessarily bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So has anything interesting happend since I left?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Unless you're like a total spaz and change your text colour because you're sad</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (but sometimes it means you tampered with second magic and got yourself dressed as a gothic loli)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (sorry, goffic)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV:  <span style="color:#000000">sometimes i just become so god damn metal it hurts</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#ffffff">What am I doing with my life.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV:  <span style="color:#ffc0cb">and sometimes i just feel like sucking some dick</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sometimes I feel like punching you in the face.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: This discussion can wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Has anything interesting happend since I was last on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What's the last thing you were around for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: The interplanetary puzzle</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, hey, yesterday I revealed the HH Arkaiser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: The what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The HH Arkaiser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What is that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Like a carapacian ship?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's cute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not just /a/ ship, but /the/ ship. This baby's of my own creation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that kind of ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Created a barebones ship with alchemy, tore it down to the chassis, and built it up from scratch. Some of... Ha, who am I kidding, most of the systems in this thing might put a carapacian ship to shame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So it was the kind of ship I originally thought you meant by 'ship'</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is it bigger on the inside?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Is what bigger on the inside?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ih</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It doesn't need to be, its plenty big as is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could we repurpose it as a back up base incase the lands explode?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Took a cue from the Super Galatic Dai-Gurren, or Cathedral Terra  if you prefer, and rigged it with an intricate web of transportilizers to facilitate movement</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: FL, I think there is probabely an artifact pertaining to LoLaB on your planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can it turn into a giant mecha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: That thing with the satalites, those satalits were just abstractions</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you charted the path the satalite is taking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So I think that an artifact for another planet has been created on every planet in our chain</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Probably not. But I mean, the weapons and defense systems are more then good enough to tear stuff to pieces</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is it watching a fixed location?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: its not an actual satalite</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It just symbolizes the placing of the artifact</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And besides I've got a couple other mechs. Chances are we're not gonna run into anything bigger'n em</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So you have my artifact</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, I'm gonna check out this abstraction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe it might have a hint or something on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: If you find anything pertaining to the land of Lava and Blindness, tell me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It might be important.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll just turn around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am so fucking lost </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Where the fuck did she go this is bullshit</span><br />
