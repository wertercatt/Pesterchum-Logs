[01:20:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((my network is crying today))</span><br />
[01:26:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, isn't something supposed to happen today?</span><br />
[01:29:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In 2 and a half hours.</span><br />
[01:35:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *Azure should be activating for the first time from his perspective.</span><br />
[01:38:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is supposedly going to be chaos.</span><br />
[01:38:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okaaay?</span><br />
[01:39:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the most he should be able to do is blow up everyones computers and such, or display rude images on the TVs.</span><br />
[01:39:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, not much of a /huge/ issue.</span><br />
[01:40:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering I have managed to get it so the server is "unhackable"</span><br />
[01:42:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so It won't be blown up.</span><br />
[02:11:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh hey PA</span><br />
[02:11:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is this bird yours?</span><br />
[02:11:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ff520e">CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary [CPA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[02:11:30] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Bird?</span><br />
[02:11:32] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What kind?</span><br />
[02:11:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, Adal supposedly knows.</span><br />
[02:12:00] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: And it's not Adal's bird?</span><br />
[02:12:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but it has giant yellow eyes and it looks like a derp</span><br />
[02:13:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus it's attached to FL, and was indirectly the cause of that bee swarm yesterday</span><br />
[02:13:20] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I guess I'll take it</span><br />
[02:13:25] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: If you don't want the bird</span><br />
[02:13:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I just... figure its someone's pet.</span><br />
[02:14:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as it looks like the trees back on our home planet with its feathers instead of the trees here</span><br />
[02:15:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and its head kinda makes me think its slightly crossed with a frog.</span><br />
[02:16:05] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Uh...huh.</span><br />
[02:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so it might have been a mix up with the frog ectobiology.</span><br />
[02:16:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if thats even possible.</span><br />
[02:16:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[02:19:54] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably not.</span><br />
[02:20:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah my guess is it would be more frog like if it was.</span><br />
[02:23:58] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably.</span><br />
[02:25:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, it would kinda make sense if it was an ectobiology experement with the hypno toad, but thats... likely not the case.</span><br />
[02:40:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so what are you two doing?</span><br />
[02:42:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not much right now, I guess. floating around on tumblr, probably gonna draw stuff later.</span><br />
[02:42:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 80 minutes to go.</span><br />
[02:42:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 5400 seconds about</span><br />
[02:57:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((FL. help. your IC insanity is rubbing off on me oocly.))</span><br />
[02:57:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( which part? ))</span><br />
[02:57:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( FL counting down? ))</span><br />
[02:57:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I just came up with a weird time shit theory for how Dirk's Auto-Responder builds a robo-arm, which then retroactively becomes the Mastermind O_O))</span><br />
[02:58:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (([12:53:22 PM] Kimura: obviously SiD's universe has homestuckian time physics, so maybe Mastermind Arm threatened AR from the future into becoming a mole and building the arm in the first place, or else be erased by doomed timeline? [12:53:39 PM] Ash: ............ [12:53:55 PM] Ash: Ash blinks at Kimura like wat [12:54:29 PM] David Archibald Strider: Dave is Mondo and Aleesa is Chihiro [12:54:44 PM] Kimur</span><br />
[02:58:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">Kimura is on dayquil right now, please disregard his 1pm nightblogging [12:55:23 PM] Grimdark!Jake: ono [12:55:49 PM] David Archibald Strider: thats some FL level craziness right there ))</span><br />
[02:59:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Dave == Bradmun, fyi))</span><br />
[02:59:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( yeah I guessed ))</span><br />
[02:59:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( and now I bet everyone is asking "who is fl" ))</span><br />
[03:00:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((nope, actually. the topic went back to Homosuck AUs))</span><br />
[03:00:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( wooo ))</span><br />
[03:00:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( At least its better than my theory of the entity thats controling Jane is a future version of AR. ))</span><br />
[03:01:46] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Counting down to being able to kill you without stupid game bullshit getting in the way.</span><br />
[03:02:14] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That's what I'm up to.</span><br />
[03:02:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what?</span><br />
[03:02:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, just because a doomed timeline would no longer be in the way, doesn't mean he wouldn't still revive if it was a plain death.</span><br />
[03:02:52] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, but that's just one more thing not in my way.</span><br />
[03:02:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what do you mean doomed tim- Oh, *Azure.</span><br />
[03:03:10] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: The kid's pretty much a lost cause anyway, shouldn't be long before he does somethin Just.</span><br />
[03:04:44] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Then I'll find a spaceship, then I'll conquer a universe.</span><br />
[03:06:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...huh.</span><br />
[03:06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The countdown just lessened by a minute.</span><br />
[03:07:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was going to end on 4:14 on my clock... but now its gonna end... oh gog dammit the number returns.</span><br />
[03:08:02] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Sounds dumb to me.</span><br />
[03:08:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what is /with/ paradox space and 413s?</span><br />
[03:08:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess as the countdown goes down, it gets more exact?</span><br />
[03:09:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it might have been destined to happen that way anyways.</span><br />
[03:09:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is funny, cause if you ignored daylight savings, it would have been 3:14 originally</span><br />
[03:10:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so wait it ends in three minutes what</span><br />
[03:10:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, if you /ignored/ daylight savings.</span><br />
[03:10:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we still have another hour.</span><br />
[03:10:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh. wait. you were /Central/ time, not Eastern.</span><br />

[03:20:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I'm not talking about Azure. I'm talking about 413 itself, /and it being such a big thing in homestuck/.</span><br />
