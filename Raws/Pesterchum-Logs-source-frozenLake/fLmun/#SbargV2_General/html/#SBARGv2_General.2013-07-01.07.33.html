<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: see, there's nothing /wrong/ with that second one</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: but bladeKind is /easily/ the most engorged weapon class and I can't help the gag reflex</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: the first one, the PS weapon, was pretty cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#412841">CSA: I'd say it's alright, but... yeah, the fact that bladekind has easily the largest database for weapons...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure most of us pick bladekind because it has the most weapons, then we just try and make more weapons for it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And the third one's another bladeKind. Same as last time, nothing /wrong/ with it but yeah</span><br />

<span style="color:#412841">CSA: Also staffkind /and/ pistolkind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Scanned abstrata for weapons with endgame level stats that /weren't/ bladeKind</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I started out lanceKind, but quickly reached the top dual-wielding dragon pipes</span><br />
<span style="color:#412841">CSA: Weren't /just/ for me because I use bladekind like your avg. JRPG char <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: which, while admittedly badass, weren't even close to endgame level</span><br />
<span style="color:#412841">CSA: Bladekind unfortunately /easily/ has the most amount of endgame weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Swapped over to spearKind and got Gungnir which had endgame 9999 power but next to no/piss poor modifiers</span><br />
<span style="color:#412841">CSA: Which leads to people using it and submitting /more/ weapons and. Vicious cycle essentially.</span><br />
