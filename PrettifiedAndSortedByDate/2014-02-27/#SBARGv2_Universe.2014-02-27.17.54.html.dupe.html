<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ to the best of my abilities</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ So</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ If I am correct, correct me if im wrong. The players started their session of Sburb as any normal session</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ even though the game is never normal</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ but the guardian per say was actually an evil being/player known as Chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ who basically broke all the gates to each players land, etc. </span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ lot's of conflict</span><br />

<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ there were many losses, dungeons, drama, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ but eventually</span><br />

<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ who was ridiculously strong and big, and basically invincible</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ 13 billion+ health</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it was more of a hide and seek with the black king and a cardboard cutout. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ that too, that slippery bastard</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ eventually we used Sburban Finale, which was a fraymotif, that required one player of every aspect to use their powers against the king</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ this obliterated his health </span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ we killed him</span><br />

<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ Chronos himself</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ and after an even bigger battle</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ and a giant fucking Hope and Rage Drill chase</span><br />

<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ had a royal ball</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ and fought the NEW threat</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ the Blue Hole, which was basically a glitch in the game, unable to be ficksed by Ornis</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ it also prevented us from beating the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ so Seth and Brae destroyed it with the help of other players</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ and we finally were able to beat the game that had caused everyone so much stress, fun, and grief</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ once we got to the new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ AKA Gene</span><br />
<span style="color:#21c8ba">CPE: ~ most people went their seperate ways, on their own</span><br />
