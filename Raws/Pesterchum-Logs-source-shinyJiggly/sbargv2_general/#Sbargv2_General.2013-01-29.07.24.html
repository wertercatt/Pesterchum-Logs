<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 GENERAL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi there</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#3a4961">CURRENT anomalousEntity [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: had to go out buy something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: how did you like my 3 664-word update?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: (i'm always looking for comments and criticism)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was pretty thick, that's for sure. At some points I was wondering why they were info-dumping on eachother, but the dumps themselves were facinating.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it's some of passive-aggressive thing between what I hate about myself and what I want to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it's wonderful how i've come to analyse my own self through writing this thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: and by wonderful i mean completely horrifying</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i almost never use "wonderful" in a non-sarcastic way</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, I kinda skimmed past the egogiastuff, even though that probably had some sort of strange plot/puzzle/story signifigance</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: "CHAPTER 6 LOL DID SP[EL CHEKING ON THIS ONE SO FUK U PREPZ"</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i actually started laughing out loud when i read that dramatically</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i'm glad you liked it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: 4/5 hats, would read again, if only to get all the details and such. </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (sorry, by bro called me out into the other room to look at something)</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it's nothing. i know how it is to be distracted</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: thanks so much</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, I gotta go soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: okay then</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: see you</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nice talking with you.</span><br />
