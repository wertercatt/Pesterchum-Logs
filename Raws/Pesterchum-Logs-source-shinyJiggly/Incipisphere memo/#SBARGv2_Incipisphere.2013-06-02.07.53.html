<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And I liked /that/ game better when it was called X5</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I liked Battle Network 3.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well a 'course you did, it was a good game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then they made battle network 4... :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Now if you said you liked Battle Network /4/, well I'd have to wonder if everything's alright in your head</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeeeeeah there it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Battle network 4 SUCKED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny thing, that. The Battle Network games go in cycles, just like the Resident Evil ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Except its a different cycle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, the concept of the dark chips was a bit... entertaining.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SV can tell you that its a logical argument.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As he apparenly is going to die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I never played the battle network games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For Battle Network its rubbish game with some potential waaaay below the surface, greatly improved game maxing on the concepts of the last one, and absolute bully game to peak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Then the cycle repeats</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, 6 was FUN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then they reinvented the wheel with star force.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Battle Network 1 was rubbish no two ways about it. Battle Network 2 was the surprisingly improved sequel, streamlining the internet and navigation, introducing style changes,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 peaked in the story...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Battle Network 3 was the sum cumulation, building on everything to be arguably the best of the trilogy and capping it off</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I always thought that the Cross system in 6 was better than the style system, but thats just me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's my fondest dream that they rerelease the first three battle network games on the 3DS in a compilation, polishing 1 up to par with the last two and linking them such that chips and such carry over, making it into a real complete experience</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also Chaos Unison is OP, nerf plz.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or atleast prevent pausing while charging.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Chaos Unison and the Cross system were OP as /shit/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Beast Out similarly so and Cross Beast just broke the game into tiny little pieces.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cross worked, but it might have been better if you could only have a few crosses at a time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So yeah, that cycle. Battle Network 4 was trash, 5 was surprsingly improved, and 6 was great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Mostly unnecessary but hey Zero 4's much the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, I have a lets play.</span><br />
