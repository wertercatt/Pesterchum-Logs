[04:09:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty much just kick a table in the coolest way possible. ➜</span><br />
[04:10:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: since distance based tends to get out of hand. ➜</span><br />
[04:10:43] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: dropkicking?</span><br />

[04:13:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like</span><br />
[04:13:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: depends on how cool it looks. ➜</span><br />

[04:14:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ill try to slip out and leave amy to radd</span><br />
[04:14:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm afraid if I tried to kick a table normally I might break my foot.</span><br />
[04:14:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the points will be done 1-10, rated seperately by everyone involved ((and mostly based off of description quality)) ➜</span><br />
[04:14:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might have to pass.</span><br />

[04:16:50] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah needs more context</span><br />
[04:17:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he's referring to the point system ➜</span><br />
[04:17:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh</span><br />
[04:17:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: pfft</span><br />
[04:17:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a way to even it out is to record it and do the point stuff way later after watching the tapes a bunch and stuff maybe. ➜</span><br />
[04:18:06] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: nah why bother</span><br />
[04:18:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug</span><br />

[04:18:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on my land</span><br />
[04:18:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((bluh... kinda need to have a shower now, but at the same time if an event's about to start...))</span><br />
[04:18:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ooh, that sounds cool ➜</span><br />
[04:18:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets do it later</span><br />
[04:18:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, 45 minutes or something?</span><br />
[04:19:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sounds good. ➜</span><br />
[04:19:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: picnic/garden planting party?</span><br />

[04:20:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ehhhh</span><br />
[04:20:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its obvious Ash is the best table kicker in the session</span><br />
[04:20:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so its really just gonna be a fight for second place</span><br />
[04:21:02] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...i guess im leaving amy to radd</span><br />
[04:21:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eh, it's not supposed to be about the competition, it's supposed to be an excuse to bring us together. ➜</span><br />
[04:21:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, you can't beat orbiting multiple gravity wells and getting it to land exactly where it was</span><br />
