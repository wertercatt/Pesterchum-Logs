<span style="color:#5e008d">CPT: ok so</span><br />
<span style="color:#5e008d">CPT: that wasn't actually a cloud? it was a bunch of horrorterror tentacles</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ef041">CSG: Mhm..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CLE: hmmmmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: I thought that's what it was in the first place.,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: I want to ask sbarg a question and tumblr won't let me</span><br />
<span style="color:#5e008d">CPT: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ef041">CSG: I bet I could ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ef041">CSG: What is the question?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: "What will happen if we cannot find all the codes in time?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#5e008d">CPT: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: Because, that answer will scare a lot of people into finishing this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we can't then it will cause a paradox most likely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5e008d">CPT: i'm going to go try a couple of tarot spreads to see if i can figure out what they're talking about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, if the game is not started, the chess game never progresses...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And thus the meteors don't come to kill us before we start the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ef041">CSG: Mkay, I asked.,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: The meteors would just come.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CLE: i just askede another thing </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Really? How can they come if they never were sent in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: It would be an end of the world scenario instead of a situation where a few people can survive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its a paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: Remember the thing where Rose was explaining how so many sessions are void, failed, or not even started?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: somewhat close to a grandfather paradox- oh nuts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ef041">CSG: Hey guys...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CLE: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: I don't see it being a paradox. If the meteors are coming, then they aren't going to just turn around and say "Oop! they didn't start the game yet!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ef041">CSG: Someone say something over texas. :o</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CMD: The stalemate...I am really unsure.</span><br />
