<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  grins like a little kid as she double clicks, immediately tossing the thing into the air as out pops a disc with red lines that seems vaguely reminiscent of Tron, though it's much thicker and there's one section where the lines fall off from the design, and another smaller section glowing red. She immediately catches it in her hands and pulls it apart, revealing two thin discs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You need a lot more gear than your leg, so why not?</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  then tightens her grip around the unlit section entirely, showing the entire giant button there, and everyone hears a small high-pitched screech before a laser literally shoots out of the glowing red end, hitting at the center of the target she's pointing at and burning right through it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: And that is your demo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: cool. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  gently helps Niki adjust her grip to be more firm and nodding at her aim, gives her the all clear to shoot. --</span><br />
