[13:35:42] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Quiet Sunday, huh.</span><br />
[13:35:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( we have a general memo for the OOC stuff ))</span><br />
[13:35:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kinda good this way.</span><br />
[13:36:02] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((BUT NOBODY IS IN THERE))</span><br />
[13:36:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((^))</span><br />
[13:37:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: rob do you have any ideas on how to get a soul to control a constuct?</span><br />
[13:37:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[13:37:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A few.</span><br />
[13:37:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I swear to god.</span><br />
[13:37:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...any that you would be willing to share?</span><br />
[13:38:12] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Depends. What do you wanna know for?</span><br />
[13:38:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Soulbots.</span><br />
[13:40:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, they would likely have to learn how to walk again from scratch, but... yeah.</span><br />
[13:40:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Who's soul are you planning to put into these things?</span><br />
[13:41:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[13:41:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a f-couple laying around.</span><br />
[13:42:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So a few laying around.</span><br />
[13:43:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Iunno if I'd trust a guy who shopped around tumblr for a title definition to do Heart-y things.</span><br />
[13:47:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh really. What would I have found on tumblr if that was the case?</span><br />
[13:47:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A bunch of people who have no idea what they're talking about.</span><br />
[13:48:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: 9/10 yeah.</span><br />
[13:48:19] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I distinctly remember Amanda giving a stupid thing about "only taking a little of a soul" and accompanying it with a dumb homestuck gif</span><br />
[13:48:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just a little soul.</span><br />
[13:48:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Distinctly because mind-numbingly dumb things stick with me</span><br />
[13:49:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well excuse me that classpects in the game are dumb and confusing as hell.</span><br />
[13:49:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I hate to circlejerk with Rob aggressively but hell that might be the reason you've stayed like, exactly the same through the entire session</span><br />
[13:49:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, do /you/ even know what heart is?</span><br />
[13:49:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nope</span><br />
[13:49:37] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I have no idea</span><br />
[13:49:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, even though you are a heart play-... fuck.</span><br />
[13:49:45] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I got through the game with absolutely </span><br />
[13:49:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: no idea</span><br />
[13:49:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: achieved my personal growth</span><br />
[13:50:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was a Page of Heart for a day and I probably have a better idea of what Heart is than you Charles</span><br />
[13:50:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: realized i didn't have to put on a dumb name and gank everything under the sun to make something meaningful of myself</span><br />
[13:50:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: and kicked the ass off the greatest crafter and his three kids</span><br />
[13:50:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And never achieved godhood.</span><br />
[13:51:02] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: without an /inkling/ of what Heart is</span><br />
[13:51:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Godhood's overrated anyway</span><br />
[13:51:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well yeah, since you have to watch all your friends die around you.</span><br />
[13:51:48] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh. Yeah. Because me being God Tier or not is indicative of my understanding, and not of whether I was either dumb enough to die somehow, or power-hungry enough to do it to myself</span><br />
[13:51:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I mean that's what you're trying to say right? </span><br />
[13:52:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:52:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: &gt;dumb enough to die somehow</span><br />
[13:52:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I blame my death on you guys being dumb to this day</span><br />
[13:52:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: HEY GUYS. GUYS. MAYBE....WE HAVE TO /LET/ THE WOLVES EAT HIM.</span><br />
[13:52:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: we're not talking about this again</span><br />
[13:52:27] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: WE'RE NOT</span><br />
[13:52:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: GODDAMMIT NICO WHAT KIND OF REAL WOLF</span><br />
[13:52:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: WHAT KIND OF REAL WOLF IS /RED/</span><br />
[13:52:41] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: OR /GREEN/</span><br />
[13:52:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh come on, if we had done something, it would have retroactively been wrong anyway</span><br />
[13:52:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: GODDAMNIT ROB WHAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT WITH A DENIZEN WHO'S KNOWN TO BE A HUGE BITCH</span><br />
[13:53:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There /was/ no right answer.</span><br />
[13:53:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: SHE STABBED CHARLES FOR OFFERING A HUG YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D MAUL A KID WITH MULTI-COLORED WOLVES</span><br />
[13:53:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless we cheat.</span><br />
[13:53:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You just never even look for a right answer</span><br />
[13:53:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, what is 2+2</span><br />
[13:53:53] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fish.</span><br />
[13:54:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: HA I WAS TALKING BASE THREE- ...fuck.</span><br />
[13:54:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It could be 11, it could be 10, it would /usually/ be 4.</span><br />
[13:55:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But knowing what kinda shit the game put us through, it was likely 5.</span><br />
[13:55:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't look for the right answer anymore because /logic doesn't mean anything to paradox space/.</span><br />
[13:56:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The game didn't put me through anything particularly awful, but then again I didn't lose my planet</span><br />
[13:56:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I actually was mildly competent about my land quest</span><br />
[13:56:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sure lets just... keep talking about how much of a failure I am.</span><br />
[13:57:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I'll figure out my own way to get a soul to control these robots</span><br />
[13:57:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well when you're not doing anything about it</span><br />
[13:57:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But like seriously, Heart is the aspect of the soul and the self, and you really haven't figured out your title yet?</span><br />
[13:58:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh please, the self can be many different things</span><br />
[13:58:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it isn't fixed to just /one answer/... oh.</span><br />
[13:58:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No, that can't be the right answer, it can't be that its a cat in a box.</span><br />
[13:58:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[13:59:09] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought you had it, at least a little</span><br />
[13:59:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: but then you just let it slip through your fingers</span><br />
[13:59:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you know what I'm just gonna say fuck it to looking.</span><br />
[13:59:55] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: like so much of mom's spaghetti</span><br />
[14:00:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't need to know in order to set myself on fire and die.</span><br />
[14:00:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously those are the two things I'm good at</span><br />
[14:00:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Have you tried being good any anything else?</span><br />
[14:00:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well I'm good at Sonic 06</span><br />
[14:01:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but thats not something I /should/ be good at</span><br />
[14:01:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I'm halfway decent at sonic games</span><br />
[14:02:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not a master, but... decent at least</span><br />
[14:02:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you even know anything about you, yourself?</span><br />
[14:02:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might not ever be the best at one thing, but at least I can be decent at multiple things</span><br />
[14:05:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Y'know I'm actually curious, what do you think Rogue of Heart means?</span><br />
[14:05:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um... that I have to steal souls in order to help things? well, steal and give.</span><br />
[14:05:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like... oh gog I'm a politican.</span><br />
[14:06:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ....Wow.</span><br />
[14:06:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TAXES</span><br />
[14:06:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay. Hold up.</span><br />
[14:06:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: God please stop.</span><br />
[14:06:09] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[14:06:33] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay, okay. That's what you think a Rogue of Heart is in entirety?</span><br />
[14:06:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
[14:07:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I never was good at putting feelings into words.</span><br />
[14:07:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe uh, you should try getting good at that.</span><br />
[14:08:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why? Its not like you would ever let me get a job in teaching.</span><br />
[14:09:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is a difference in knowing something and being able to explain it.</span><br />
[14:09:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hell some people that can explain it don't even know it</span><br />
[14:09:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Being able to explain it is probably the greatest test in knowing something you could have</span><br />
[14:09:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's why a valid method of studying is teaching the thing to somebody else</span><br />
[14:10:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hell it's how I figured out what my title meant, albeit the "students" were robots.</span><br />
[14:10:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...and Echidna but I won't count her since well.</span><br />
[14:12:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Echidna won the contest for "most adorbs denizen"</span><br />
[14:12:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: She probably had no idea she was even entered.</span><br />
[14:12:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like Luigi?</span><br />
[14:12:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably.</span><br />
[14:13:17] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And then there was that other Witch, she was pretty helpful.</span><br />
[14:13:17] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: man i still remember that time she totally scammed us</span><br />
[14:13:18] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Anyone else remember the Yaldabaoth Telos fight?</span><br />
