<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't think I'm ever gonna get annoyed at people badmouthing the HTs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, stuff was happening earlier...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, all they did was get us pissed off at Seth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /They/ did that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh, man. Silly me I figured that was him uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /Killing people/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((what's happening/did happen on LoIaR? just idle HQ memo?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Y'know like me? And Fi?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They were the ones that directed us to the tumblr.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Shortly before that, you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, he killed me too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ninja'd</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DAMN YOU</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The one's who directed us to that tumblr and let us know who/what to look out for? Giving us info?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: They didn't /turn anyone/ against anyone they gave us info to draw our own conclusions from. Not hard conclusions, mind you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Giving us info that just made issues with Seth even worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No no again I'm pretty sure that was the fact that he was /killing people/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then basically doing /nothing/ for the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wow I'm</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: laughing</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I can't believe you're actually turning Seth's issues into one to be sourced to the HTs. I actually can't believe that's what you're doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I take it you see it as that I'm making excuses to be angry at the horror terrors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mostly cause that's exactly what you're doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The least they could do is help with the blue hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because, what happens if we can't stop it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It likely would end up expanding into horror terror space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and assuming it expands without limits, it would eventually eat all of paradox space...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its their problem as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, it could just be prospitian propaganda thats stuck in my head from my dream self...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I doubt its just one factor though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might just be a general distrust of authority.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Personally I just don't think this session was meant to succeed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hahahahaha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, so far we've /made/ it succeed... I don't see any reason to NOT follow through at this point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the Reckoning is over, Chronos is gone, the Frog is growing... all we gotta do is close the <span style="color:#0000ff">Hole</span> and we've won.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: are we meant to make the new universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Should we even be gods?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Me personally I think anyone on about this God stuff is off their rocker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because sadly, I don't think we have grown up at all through out the course of this entire game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I figure every two hundred years or so I would be giving a mind hero a visit to wipe out a large portion of my memory.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: think about wha<span style="color:#730e8f">t you just said</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: you clearly haven't fo<span style="color:#730e8f">r long enough then</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think about it, even if we are immortal ourselves, that doesn't mean the consorts or crux are as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As such, we would out live them... multiple times.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Multiple times?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit... you /are/ right about that :(</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah the way I figure it just the once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah consorts'll probably die soon. Crux, too. Me, if I don't God Tier soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And even that'll only earn me however long it takes me to bite off more than I can chew and stumble into a Heroic Death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I don't want some great great grandchild of a consort to notice me in a picture and start asking questions that would just... bring back sadness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Meh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A parent should never have to outlive his children.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...now that I think about it, even Issun would die eventually, being technically an organic being. (which is still a mystery I never got around to solving)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: People live. People die. That's just, /life/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: and whether you wipe your memory routinely or not it's <span style="color:#730e8f">not going to change that it will happen</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except sadly... we won't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You think so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just would want to wipe my memory of all those I had lost... so I don't grow cold and distant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because God Tier doesn't last forever. It doesn't last past certain deaths, that's for sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ..<span style="color:#730e8f">..</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Thinkin' you're gonna live forever...Is that under the assumption you lock yourself away in some cabin like a hermit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: F<span style="color:#730e8f">L</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its under the assumption that I stay out of major wars, and not take sides.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: I am tellin<span style="color:#730e8f">g you now</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, yada yadda yaddda its a bad idea and you are saying I shouldn't do it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That /was/ what you were going to say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't deny it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: I will not have that<span style="color:#730e8f"> taken so lightly though</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, even if our lifespans are unlimited... the capacity of the human brain is not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eventually, you will start overwriting memories.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And you will forget.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, that's true. I remember a special the mythbusters did once about how humans /could/ be immortal, and one of the problems they proposed a solution to was that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, that was just Adam Savage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (it wasn't a mythbusters episode itself, just hosted by them)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See previous statement.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (see number of routers kicked into kerbin orbit for lag)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The title of the show was Curiosity: Can You Live Forever</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi PO ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why would I do that indeed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If anything /I've/ got plans. I've got goals, abstract as they are. And yet here I sit, patently non-godly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why would /I/ do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7f20">CPO: What's goin on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey Mike.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh nothin' just Charles bein' a little bitch. The usual.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wasn't the one that set myself on the crypt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I kind of didn't have a say in the matter. I couldn't go through the door as a sprite (as far as we know, anyway), so I /had/ to tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, FL got the tiers kinda forced on him by the denizen battle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I... honestly expected that day to be my final death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dammit, why couldn't I have just stayed dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh. Damn, thinking on it...Yeah you weren't one'a those who just did it for the sake of doing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Your death /meant/ something. My bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah, previous statement about being a little bitch retracted. In part.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Big part though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the only reason why I got tiger was because I thought it was going to be important so that I could actually be considered useful in the final battle. Probably a stupid reason considering how little it even impacted. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you also had to do it because of a stable loop if I remember, SJ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I only stupidly looped for that reason. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the loop only cemented it happening in the alpha timeline. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, if you believe that one theory about the ultimate riddle, its our subconsious that helps to enforce those Timeloops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its why our future selves can pull off a stable timeloop to push us out of a rockslide.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because /we/ wouldn't want to get caught in said rockslide.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: theoretically. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in practice, it would be considered cheap. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and the current version of that pers on would be considered pampered by their other time'd self. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah... but would /you/ want to be pampered?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or would you like to be able to grow as a person?</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I /could/ use heart powers to check the loot for lich soul.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: do what now FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wouldnt recommend trying to do anything with that dungeon unless you can send your heartself or whatever with a sword</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not trained in /that/ kind of heart powers.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: liches dont have souls do they?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: They have those, phyla things that I can't spell for the life of me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought the whole thing was /those/ were their souls. Or contained their souls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: liches are basically what fl just described himself as</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He doesn't keep his soul in something other then his body.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No magic or anything, either</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he uses science instead of magic</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its still mostly dark science</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...literally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, either I switch souls around, or burn portions of my own soul up.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this makes too much sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I don't have to murder to move my soul to something else.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i love you nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You could say that about any aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well life actually is lame so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's true. all aspects have their weak points...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And so is void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: void rad</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering they are weak against sensory attacks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: void is the most op aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its clearly unfinished</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, they still see and hear, and that can be used against them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With Seisure Grenades for example.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or perhaps you could overload them by using that one sonic thing in Iron Man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you mean the music from HOW 2 DRAW SANIC HEGEHOG</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNK</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the one that Stane used on Tony to basically knock him out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that doesnt answer my question</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, I believe that voiders need to remain consious to continue being voided out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7f20">CPO: What are Hope's weaknesses?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: despair</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You cast self doubt upon them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Make them lose confidence in their own abilities.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Light's weakness is obvious. bad luck and obfuscation of knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If a hope player thinks he can't do something, Its not going to happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also darkness</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7f20">CPO: So I have to blast through all doubt with sheer mangrit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, I would say the main weakness is situations where luck doesn't matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...eh, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at the same time though, that clusterfuck of bad luck stuff when the HQ was in halloween mode /really/ messed me up :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also when you roll high rolls when you need bad rolls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Messed /you/ up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I rolled all 8s on my 8 Splash Damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it... didn't take off at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: touche x2 combo</span><br />
