[02:47:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, our first session of debate will be the discussion of "game constructs" in the new universe.</span><br />

[02:48:20] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: wouldn't anything created with an alchemiter be a game construct?</span><br />

[02:48:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would be "constructed with a game construct" ➜</span><br />
[02:48:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A major factor in this might actually be the exiles, as they were able to exist on earth.</span><br />

[02:49:35] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that seems like semantics to me tbh</span><br />
[02:49:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So if anyy carapacians would show up theyy'd be from the new universes session /)</span><br />
[02:50:01] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Which I think we can agree, the Frog temple meteor hasnt even arrived yyet /)</span><br />
[02:50:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT paleBeachbum <span style="color:#00a600">[CPB]</span>  can't agree --</span><br />

[02:50:44] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: wouldn't there be more than one frog temple</span><br />
[02:50:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, that is a point, but the new universe and the old one don't have any physical laws changed, plus Consorts and sprites have been brought through.</span><br />
[02:50:48] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: and if the universe is infinite</span><br />
[02:50:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ No /)</span><br />
[02:51:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT paleBeachbum <span style="color:#00a600">[CPB]</span>  thinks that probably more than one planet got sburb --</span><br />
[02:51:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PB has a point, we have nothing so far that states only one planet in a universe can have a successful session.</span><br />
[02:51:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT paleBeachbum <span style="color:#00a600">[CPB]</span>  is probably stupid but whatever --</span><br />
[02:51:40] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ THats.... okayy thats a decent point but whyy would yyou want that /)</span><br />
[02:51:54] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why do you not want it?</span><br />
[02:52:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's more than one planet out there that's been set up for being in a session, session time and standard universe time is seperate, but the point is AC's other session was canonicaly unsuccessful and probably went by a more standard set of SBURB rules. ➜</span><br />
[02:52:34] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: yeah</span><br />
[02:52:46] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: I was actually going to write a gaiden or whatever it was called at some point</span><br />
[02:52:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so a lot of things should be more restricted from AC's session stuff. ➜</span><br />
[02:52:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Personally, I find it interesting that First Guardians and Sprites were able to go through, but with a large degree of changes.</span><br />
[02:53:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why not use those sort of changes with the denizens and carapaces for example?</span><br />
[02:53:45] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB:  well</span><br />
[02:53:57] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: the carapaces I know can prototype outside of the session</span><br />
[02:53:58] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Okayy /)</span><br />
[02:54:04] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: because didn't PM do that?</span><br />
[02:54:06] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ then yyeah I can understand AC's people showing up /)</span><br />
[02:54:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PB, that was the case on Earth.</span><br />
[02:54:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we already know that going through the door tends to cause physical changes.</span><br />
[02:54:46] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: oh the doo</span><br />
[02:54:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if it were up to me and if I were a jerk about it, I would tell certain people to stop smuggling in denizens and chess people and consorts. ➜</span><br />
[02:54:47] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: *door</span><br />
[02:54:48] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: then yeah</span><br />
[02:55:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mainly with the Sprites and Ornis.</span><br />
[02:55:06] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Im with yyou there SJ /)</span><br />
[02:55:08] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Like /)</span><br />
[02:55:19] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ The onlyy reason Im okayy with consorts /)</span><br />
[02:55:22] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ is because Nak got through /)</span><br />
[02:55:28] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ But naks whole thing was fucked up /)</span><br />
[02:55:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL was one of the primary smugglers, so you can understand where I am coming through on this.</span><br />
[02:55:35] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I gave up tryying to understand it /)</span><br />
[02:55:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nak is the best tho</span><br />
[02:55:50] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So, yyeah /)</span><br />
[02:55:58] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ thats the onlyy reason i was okayy with consorts /)</span><br />
[02:56:07] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ also, theyy didnt have anyything that could possiblyy destroyy worlds /)</span><br />
[02:56:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: heh, if cp was online i imagine wed be a lot more chill about everything</span><br />
[02:56:28] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he just has that effect doesnt he</span><br />
[02:56:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ash, I believe that is the logic for Ornis losing his powers.</span><br />
[02:56:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ...He does tend to have that impact /)</span><br />
[02:56:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYeah, Ornis went the sprite route /)</span><br />
[02:56:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: CP was one of the main canonbreakers, but I didn't want to say anything. ➜</span><br />
[02:56:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As well as the Sprites losing powers.</span><br />
[02:56:58] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think someone compared him to the mayor</span><br />
[02:57:00] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ He lost his powers and became a regular old Crane... that can talk /)</span><br />
[02:57:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why did you let the Sprites and Ornis through?</span><br />
[02:57:10] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ SJ /)</span><br />
[02:57:15] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ CP Still managed to keep within the canon though /)</span><br />
[02:57:22] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also personally i dont understand why we need to perfectly follow hs canon to begin with</span><br />
[02:57:23] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Despite the little Breaks here and there /)</span><br />
[02:57:30] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ He wasnt NEARLYY As huge an offender as some others /)</span><br />
[02:57:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he basically started the precident of the whole "game rip-offs everywhere" theme. ➜</span><br />
[02:57:55] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYeah but... Iunno /)</span><br />
[02:57:57] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Something about that guyy /)</span><br />
[02:58:04] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I enjoyyed everyy minuet of it /)</span><br />
[02:58:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, he's too nice to be mad at. ➜</span><br />
[02:58:14] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also unlike some other players his canon-breaking felt like an improvement over canon</span><br />
[02:58:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ He at least followed the rules when it came to Alchemyy and Grist /)</span><br />
[02:58:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: his canon-breaking felt like it was done well</span><br />
[02:58:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it had a basis, due to the glitches.</span><br />
[02:59:00] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ..."So bad its good" Comes to mind /)</span><br />
[02:59:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like with a game like sburb that has a massive file size, spawning permissions could be screwed up.</span><br />
[02:59:27] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nah not that ash</span><br />
[02:59:45] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: more like he kind of broke canon... intelligently?</span><br />
[02:59:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, allowing normally alchemized items to become part of the world generation.</span><br />
[03:00:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least, thats how I understood CP's thing.</span><br />
[03:00:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: when he broke canon there was a point to it</span><br />
[03:00:26] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he wasnt just doing it for the sake of it</span><br />
[03:00:39] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Exactlyy /)</span><br />
[03:00:50] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ All in all CP was a huge offender but it FIT /)</span><br />
[03:00:54] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though i may want to point out</span><br />
[03:01:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: who knows what people might do with having denizens around</span><br />
[03:02:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly. Which is why I suggested stripping powers.</span><br />
[03:02:10] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no i mean</span><br />
[03:02:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: fun fact: the glitch/game hacking excuse was the only reason we could make up to have v2 actually being able to be a thing when v1 canonically said that there could be no further sessions from that version of earth. ➜</span><br />
[03:02:32] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not having them around just shuts down plots that could be there</span><br />
[03:02:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: good /and/ bad</span><br />
[03:03:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes. After all, I kinda wanna keep the Firebird so people can interact with her. Not because of her powers, but what her powers /made her into/.</span><br />
[03:04:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, I might be able to count the times Denizens left planets if you are using that excuse... Though it was usually some players and in the primary case, Rob.</span><br />
[03:05:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because of Dae and his kids showing up at the <span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafé</span>.</span><br />
[03:05:47] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYeah, uh... /)</span><br />
[03:05:56] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ FL some of those things slipped under our noses /)</span><br />
[03:06:02] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Rob was a pretty big canon-breaker too. ➜</span><br />
[03:06:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: rob was literally a gm though right</span><br />
[03:06:14] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ And byy the time we had learned about them, theyy had alreadyy happened and it was too late to Retcon them /)</span><br />
[03:06:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: only for  the last half really ➜</span><br />
[03:06:26] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: then its certainly too late now</span><br />
[03:06:40] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ No ones made mention of, or even interacted with those denizens though /)</span><br />
[03:06:41] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ theyy're just /)</span><br />
[03:06:43] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ kinda there /)</span><br />
[03:07:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: to facilitate potential future plots</span><br />
[03:07:06] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So i dont see what the big deal with them not being there is /)</span><br />
[03:07:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I'm suggesting the power strip method. That should prevent the denizens being used horribly.</span><br />
[03:07:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: anyway im dinner</span><br />
[03:07:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, some people made... attachments with the denizens.</span><br />
[03:07:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYes, thats... thats the point of them, FL /)</span><br />
[03:07:52] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYou're supposed to /)</span><br />
[03:08:08] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ so when yyou have to kill them, yyou've made the journeyy into yyour title /)</span><br />
[03:08:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i made attachments to amy but i still murdered her when the time was right</span><br />
[03:08:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is a Replay Value thing.</span><br />
[03:08:32] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ But it makes sense /)</span><br />
[03:08:33] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (though i still think it was a bit too early)</span><br />
[03:08:52] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ And yyou guyys were running off Replayy value for nearlyy everyything anyywayy /)</span><br />
[03:09:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We broke off at alot of points.</span><br />
[03:09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We took inspiration from it, but didn't let it take over.</span><br />
[03:09:33] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ yyeah /)</span><br />
[03:09:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ But /)</span><br />
[03:09:57] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Of all the things that would ba allowed throuhg the door /)</span><br />
[03:10:08] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Do yyou honestlyy think a Denizen would be one of them? /)</span><br />
[03:10:12] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Like think about the Betas denizens /)</span><br />
[03:10:30] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Would Dave be able to just hike up Hephaestus and chuck him through the door? /)</span><br />
[03:10:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you put it like that, no.</span><br />
[03:11:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would seem a bit out of character for Dave to do. ➜</span><br />
[03:11:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But would you expect Jade to chuck... Bec through the door in an AU?</span><br />
[03:12:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, Bec would likely follow due to GOOD DOG BEST FRIEND</span><br />
[03:12:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think if anything, its a matter of /who would want to go through/.</span><br />
[03:14:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really think the problem here is how the denizens in our session were characterized with limited idea on how they were supposed to operate. ➜</span><br />
[03:14:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, a large majority of denizens might not want to go through, but others might want to move to some new land, something more interesting.</span><br />
[03:15:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, according to the game, they're "supposed" to be the main plotpush for the players to fix the problems on their land. ➜</span><br />
[03:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which FL absolutely failed at, and his land was destroyed.</span><br />
