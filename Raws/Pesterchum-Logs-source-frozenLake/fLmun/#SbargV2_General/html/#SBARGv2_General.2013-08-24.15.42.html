[04:18:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well i tend to think it would more be an accidental point where the script glitches</span><br />
[04:18:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: like the script for calculating the next items price or something</span><br />
[04:18:39] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">well</span></span><br />

[04:18:47] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">you</span> could call that function repeatedly in the terminal</span><br />

[04:19:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: basically you know about killscreens right?</span><br />
[04:19:32] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">assuming</span> it's all implemented correctly it would depend on your browser's highest integer number</span><br />
[04:19:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: places in endless arcade games where a script glitches or the data overflows and it spawns too many enemies or glitches the graphics horribly or gives you an impossibly short timer and the game cant progress</span><br />
[04:19:55] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i wonder if cookie clicker has one</span><br />
[04:19:57] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">yeah</span></span><br />
[04:20:10] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">most</span> of those were due to integer overflows</span><br />
[04:20:27] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">the</span> issue is that if cookie clicker has one that's goNNa be near impossible because of how much memory computers have</span><br />
[04:20:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well donkey kongs was due to a script error at least</span><br />
[04:20:43] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">MOST</span></span><br />
[04:20:57] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: there was that one person on tumblr who hacked their classic save to have a million grandmas and it crashed their browser</span><br />
[04:21:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The saves maxed out at 1000 for me.</span><br />
[04:22:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: heh</span><br />
[04:22:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and by maxed I mean I loaded then resaved.</span><br />
[04:22:49] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i just had flashbacks to editing my smb crossover and ssf2 saves with notepad to see if there were any unused characters</span><br />
[04:22:52] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: (there werent)</span><br />
[04:23:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i did do some pretty impressive reverse-engineering on the ssf2 side though</span><br />
[04:23:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: creating a save with no one unlocked then creating another with black mage unlocked and comparing the raw data</span><br />
[04:25:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: one time i did decompile the flash files and find out an unfinished version of marth was in there</span><br />
[04:25:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: still no way to actually unlock him :/</span><br />
[04:25:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like how I decompiled the flash files for... almost everything in SBARGv2?</span><br />
[04:25:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: sure</span><br />
[04:26:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: there was also a stage icon for skyworld but no other data</span><br />
[04:26:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And discovered sadly that all the data for lands were in an external file?</span><br />
[04:26:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: hue</span><br />
[04:26:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except for a land title list?</span><br />
[04:27:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which had Ramparts missing the "R"</span><br />
[04:27:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh yeah</span><br />
[04:27:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and you found a clown title too right</span><br />
[04:27:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was in the ascention flash</span><br />
[04:27:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: btw, do you know about the tcrf wiki?</span><br />
[04:27:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
[04:28:07] <span style="color:#887000">CSL:   <a href='http://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor'>http://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor</a> documents unused stuff in games</span><br />
[04:28:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh</span><br />
[04:28:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: if you have the time, a LOT of the flash game pages need improvement</span><br />
[04:28:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: like somebody found unused graphics for the final fantasy party members in smb crossover, including some custom sprites, and then uploaded them with heavy resampling</span><br />
