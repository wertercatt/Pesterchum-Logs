[01:00:58] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: lol</span><br />
[01:00:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: pretty much</span><br />

[01:01:26] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Seems accurate enough.</span><br />
[01:05:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and when I saw it, I first assumed it was a focus sash</span><br />
[01:05:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: until someone brought up the point</span><br />
[01:06:08] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Achievements in ignorance.</span><br />
[01:06:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh</span><br />
[01:06:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so what PO does</span><br />
[01:08:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, I made the ruby amulet when I had around 20 max HP</span><br />
[01:08:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so it took about 2 seconds or so to jump to max health</span><br />
[01:10:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as the formula to get one hp is currenthealth/60 seconds</span><br />
[01:10:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For people who are just starting out, thats fine.</span><br />
[01:10:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, really fine</span><br />
[01:10:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OP even</span><br />
[01:11:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but, when you start getting into the hundreds</span><br />
[01:11:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it begins to take minutes, then hours.</span><br />
[01:11:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, if you were at 360 health</span><br />
[01:11:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would take 6 seconds to recover one health</span><br />
[01:11:55] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: six minutes</span><br />
[01:11:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
[01:12:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, that would be being at a health of 21600</span><br />
[01:12:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: to recover one health</span><br />
[01:13:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, if you are at 1 hp, it takes a 60th of a second to restore one health</span><br />
[01:13:42] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh</span><br />
[01:13:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah that makes sense</span><br />
[01:14:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and its constant regen</span><br />
[01:15:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no idea how that would handle something at negative health</span><br />
[01:16:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe treat it as zero seconds?</span><br />
[01:16:06] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they die</span><br />
[01:16:06] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and stay dead</span><br />
[01:16:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or would it glitch into an unsigned interger?</span><br />
[01:16:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they'd be dead</span><br />
[01:16:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[01:16:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I was thinking</span><br />
[01:16:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like those old glitch clones</span><br />
[01:16:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that were so fucked up they had negative health</span><br />
[01:17:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which Is why I made the Healing Shiv of mine</span><br />
[01:18:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... if negative health has an interval of zero seconds... in theory it could take someone from Negative Infinity HP to 0HP in one game tick.</span><br />
[01:18:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless it treated it as an unsigned value</span><br />
[01:18:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then they'd be dead for a 60th of a second before ticking over to 1HP and go from there or something</span><br />
