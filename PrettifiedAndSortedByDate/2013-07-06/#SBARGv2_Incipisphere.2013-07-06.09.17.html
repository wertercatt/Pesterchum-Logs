<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys the Dewey Decimal System doesn't work with books on magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does it like, go on a different system?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 793.8</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's the code for books on magic and magic tricks that I remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think this kind of magic really works for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So? Use it anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's so important about the dewey decimal system anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I dunno, I just know a lot of codes from it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys, you come up with a better method of sorting the books while I cry in a corner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Make 'em alphabetical I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stick them on a rack and hope that you find the right one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And how does that help for SUBJECT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  what is organization <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay. I'll group them by subject, alphabetise the titles in each subject, and alphabetise the subjects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that works</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Yeah, because we can't do authors real well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm not gonna lie I only barely care about this right now because I"m watching Summer Wars' finale.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Good stuff. Nope, /great/ stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I care about it because it involves books.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I should show Summer Wars, cripes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe later after the dungeon romp</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that is an awesome movie</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what area would each subject be in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hell yeah it is!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: boo. yah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We can think about this later i don't even know man.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure if I'll be able to make it to the dungeon and/or movie though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We don't need "area".</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: First thing we should probably do is set 'em up with some kinda database, log 'em all. Then maybe once we've got that info down we figure out how to organize from there and carry on</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aw man, what's up Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There in the library.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the old armory.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I didn't even /realize/ we had an armory dang</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there was an armory?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … right then. I dunno where /that/ is. Can I get some directions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right across the hall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Awesome.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TAKE A BREAK!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Dude, why so insistent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've pulled three-hour shifts doing nothing but this sort of stuff on a weekly basis before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Used to be a library volunteer, dude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: RS: actually, I think I can probably make it to the dungeon thing after all. it's a Lethal Lava Land type one, right?</span><br />

<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … and Raz, with your time sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If it starts in an hour, it was probably supposed to start /now/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: I suppose I will wake up for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah. Sweet loot, the locale's crazy (if possibly lethal), it'll be a blast.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: is it the enemies that are on fire?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: or will I be wanting to inflict fire damage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's a Lethal Lava Land.</span><br />
