[07:08:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: But yes: for the other side of the choice now. Option B is I do my normal denizen job: No strings. Just be a pain in the ass to anyone hoos on LoTaL. You players would not receive any of my help, in fact: I might go out of my way to hinder you, though. You people would then be allowed to barge into my secrets and stop what you deem to be... "wrong."</span><br />

[07:11:20] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: So... those are your two choices: Help and don't bother me, or an enemy hoo you can deal with.</span><br />
[07:11:22] <span style="color:#bf97eb">CWS: "um, dude, that's proooobably not the nicest thing to be saying, to a denizen to say the least"</span><br />

[07:11:51] <span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: I would like as much help as we could get, but I'm not sure I want to see your secrets. They are you're, after all. Then again, if you explicitly said that they might be wrong....</span><br />
