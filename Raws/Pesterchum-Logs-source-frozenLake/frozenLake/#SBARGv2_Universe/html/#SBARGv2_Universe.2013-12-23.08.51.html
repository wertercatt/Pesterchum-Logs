[07:10:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might be able to tweak my computer to run a minecraft server for a small portion of the day.</span><br />
[07:11:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( basically my dad is letting me host for a small part of the day, with firewall and all. ))</span><br />
[07:11:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... is it the FTB mod thingy you keep trying to get me to figure out?</span><br />
[07:11:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that I still haven't figured out?</span><br />
[07:11:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah!</span><br />
[07:12:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, do you have the FTB launcher?</span><br />
[07:12:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no</span><br />
[07:13:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and, uh, if it's a separate launcher, that /might/ be problems.</span><br />
[07:13:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://feed-the-beast.com/'>http://feed-the-beast.com/</a> Okay, download the client first.</span><br />
[07:13:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, why?</span><br />
[07:14:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because separate launchers like that usually require the base client to be vanilla</span><br />
[07:14:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and OptiFine has to be directly installed in the jar itself</span><br />
[07:15:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it downloads multiple client folders, and you can edit the jars in the folders afterwards.</span><br />
[07:15:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, in your main FTB folder, you will get a folder for every modpack you download.</span><br />
[07:16:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'll see if I can try to get the client to work here...</span><br />
[07:16:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, in this case, FTB/TechWorld2</span><br />

[07:22:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tech World 2.</span><br />

[07:28:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured out how to load Optifine without going to the jar directly.</span><br />
[07:28:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There should be a jar that has all of the Optifine data, right?</span><br />

[07:29:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: just drop the Optifine jar in there and it will auto load.</span><br />
[07:29:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((brbdinner))</span><br />
[07:31:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait, you mean /TechWorld2/minecraft/mods, with all the other jars of the pack?</span><br />

[07:35:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and since my usual texpack is 128x, minecraft /crashes/ unless I'm using OptiFine with it. ...so vanilla textures and settings it is :/</span><br />
[07:36:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also shit, controls overlaps!</span><br />
[07:36:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there is so many new blocks that your texture pack won't work anyway.</span><br />
[07:37:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, true.</span><br />
[07:37:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, controls overlaps, wat do.</span><br />
[07:37:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, remap the controls once more?</span><br />

[07:38:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I mean /the mod controls conflict with THEMSELVES/</span><br />
[07:38:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, its fine.</span><br />
[07:38:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't worry, as those controls only come into play when holding certain items.</span><br />
[07:39:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, once I have dinner ((as in once the smoker lady gets out of my kitchen so I can get in there!)), I'll try to play the thing</span><br />

[07:40:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since redstone is the basis of energy basically.</span><br />

[10:23:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL when you say that it makes me feel even worse since then I regret some members of my "family"</span><br />
[10:27:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so yeah</span><br />
[10:29:23] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: why noτ jusτ consider your friends your family...inb4 you don'τ have frens</span><br />

[10:31:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just feels like we could be making a difference in the next sburb session</span><br />
[10:31:21] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just roll with it and relax. ➜</span><br />
[10:31:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, does this place have an end of time too?</span><br />
[10:32:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, haven't checked yet. Though it probably does. ➜</span><br />
[10:32:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: everything has an ending. ➜</span><br />
[10:32:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: dammit, why does sburb seem like avalon code</span><br />
[10:33:03] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Why worry about a sburb session in this universe when we don't know for sure if there will be one?...</span><br />
[10:33:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We /know/ there is going to be /at least/ one.</span><br />

[10:33:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell, from the universes perspective, one might have already happened.</span><br />
[10:33:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all there were other stars when we arrived.</span><br />
[10:34:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: still don't know how we could talk in space</span><br />

[10:35:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Simple.</span><br />
[10:36:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We write a walkthrough.</span><br />
[10:36:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For the predetermined events of the game that happen in every session, and for alchemy tricks.</span><br />
[10:37:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, a SBURB Alchemy Guide (with codes)</span><br />
[10:38:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or could it just be a SBURB Tech Guide?</span><br />
[10:38:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eh, maybe. ➜</span><br />
[10:39:01] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />

[10:41:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, a guide would be a good idea</span><br />
[10:42:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like Rose's Walkthrough, but written by /game veterans/ instead of cobbled together as stuff happened</span><br />
[10:42:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus I seem to have been infected by a virus on this planet that my body doesn't know how to deal with.</span><br />
[10:42:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[10:42:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tldr I have a cold</span><br />
