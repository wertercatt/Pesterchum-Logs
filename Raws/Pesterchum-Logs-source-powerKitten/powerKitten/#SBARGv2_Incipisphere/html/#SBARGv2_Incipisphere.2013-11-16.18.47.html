[06:47] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Time is also about patience and destruction. You're somewhat impatient at times and manage to be the one to "heal" your comrads both physicaly and mentally when the Time calls for it. Σ</span><br />

[06:49] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I was contacted about the situation.</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Being a Prince is all about using your aspect to destroy your aspect. You fight uncertainty and inevitability with your own timing. Σ</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but you just so happened to be on at the Time and immediately moved to help when called to do so. Σ</span><br />
[06:51] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Huh...</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: coool</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As for CP, you weaponize Light for yourself. This means using your knowledge and luck for your own gain. Its noted though that Knights don't really start out with a lot of their element and have to grow into using it mroe effectively. Σ</span><br />

[06:55] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ok so for you CP you actively change Light. Light being the aspect of luck and knowledge. Σ</span><br />
[06:57] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ What I've noticed is that people tend to rely on your to change things in their favor. Your portals are vital to dungeoneering and you work on changing the level of knowledge of everyone by actively seeking new things. Σ</span><br />
[06:58] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ You are all about change and are active in seeing that change through. Σ</span><br />

[06:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's see how you play this one out Reid</span><br />
[07:00] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well Space is all about creation, being the polar opposite of Time, and it's all about movement and position of objects. </span><br />

[07:02] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well not all about that but it's the main thing. Matter and such. </span><br />
[07:02] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ To be honest your role is somewhat similar to Jade's. Space is all about, as MP said, creation, spatial distance, the actual location of something, with minor emphasis on size and velocity. But added onto that is the idea of self image and pieces of things as well which ties into it's social aspect. Σ</span><br />
[07:03] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yay I was right about that!</span><br />

[07:04] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I've noticed that as the game has gone on you've been willing to change yourself (be it through actions, tactics, or what have you) to meet the goals you have set for yourself. You have also actively worked to change others (though not always successfully) and how they view themselves and others. You tend to be abel to piece things together quite well and are able to create new ideas and plans from the</span><br />

[07:06] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ For an example of the *changing how others see things* I'll point to your plan a while back with Rob. You guys tried to use how people see you and him as a way of hiding your plans until you could act on them. Σ</span><br />
