<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okayhow did I get here so fast??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is standing near the house. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, there's FL...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there FL ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  waves to him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just... is tapping his foot by the house. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing there's some explaining to do here? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, do you realize what you have done?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um... solved a puzzle that showed up on your blog and zoned my way out to your place? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: besides that, what did we do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Have you told him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: look, there's barely anthing to do and the puzzles were easy. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...told him what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  glances at the security camera. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, I want to ask you: why did you lie about him? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks SJ dead in the eye. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I didn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then who's that on the memo? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  "!" bubble --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, I think we should move away from the cameras before he decides to start reading lips.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: back to the mirror room?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads that way --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  follows CP. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  follows the group --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just... sits down. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... what's wrong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, you solved the puzzle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did you notice anything... off about the name?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, technically, Kim helped. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmm... let me check the memo log... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Chief Chilly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I'm on the last page, let's see here... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it says, "analyzing data... loading sprite data chamber" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But did you notice the Star next to his name?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, but where's the fine print to this contract? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you know what that star denotes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, not really? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unsaved data?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...no, not that... *sigh*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps I should just give up being all mysterious about it and say it out right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing this "sam" is a seperate thing from samsprite? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When Sam died... I scanned what was left of his mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Combining that with the left over data in his sprite amulet, I was able to make an almost perfect copy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, so that's a back-up version. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I guess that makes sense... well, what's the "almost" part?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...most of the data was corrupted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: crap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, what is it with this week and messed up players? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I was able to use the backup of the amulet to get the ghost data of when he was last in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 Sources of information.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and It still wasn't enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, you could combine that guy with some supplemental data from someone else and let him become his own thing instead of the sam he was based off of. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was able to restore his mind... but not the body.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...nor the soul.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, that kinda stuff, is sorta hard to... mess with. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured if I told you, you would have over reacted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... what do we do about him, then? just let him sit as data in a server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I just don't know what to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...should we at least tell him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Telling him would likely cause him to snap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we need to come up with a solution before pushing the problem on him. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bleh, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is face-palmong at the memo --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  <img src='smilies/facepalm.png' alt=':facepalm:' title=':facepalm:' /> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a coin. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, what are the two options in this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either we tell him, or we don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's a simplistic way of seeing things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's more to those choices than just binary face-value. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's different ways to initiate both sides too. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, there's telling him /now/, /later/, or /never/, if you want to break it down that way...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, but I would rather blame a coin then myself or any of you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, Heads, we tell him now, tails, we put the computer on standby mode and tell him later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, wait. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let us come up with a solid plan. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...How much longer can you keep him waiting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: before you do something stupid like leaving everything up to a coin toss and then messing up the execution. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first thing first we work this out one step at a time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the thing is with putting him on standby is we would need to tell him directly after turning it back on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first of all, what does he want? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: from the looks of it, he wants to get out of the house or something like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I put him in a virtual reality nuclear bunker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, that makes sense...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I completed an actual one that has his computer inside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I could smooth the transition over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually though, that will begin to get boring and it will start to have effects on him. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Better for him to think that I lied than for him to think he isn't a person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even though /I/ consider AI's to be people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, watching agents of shield, I realized he might get suspicious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, what can we do to help him feel okay with who he is now? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I honestly don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  mumbles "why does it feel like I'm one of the few who are actually interested in actually helping..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I /want/ to help, but I just don't know how It would be possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: same here. I'd do what I could to help, I just don't know what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... besides the lack of body and soul, how else is he actually different? like, in the way he acts and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which worries me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: worries you h--</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: /oh/........</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what sorta things has he done in the past that have you at high-alert? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hes acting exactly the same way he did when I started up the simulation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...He hasn't changed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually, what I meant was, how is he different from the real one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And his cooking hasn't gotten any better either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Kim, don't be rude.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...sorry :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nothing different from the real one... but thats exactly it. His mind is fixed at where he was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...He can't grow up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, okay, now I get it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, pretty much 50 first dates without the memory loss? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (never watched that movie)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (it's pretty cool for a romcom) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: me either. I'm not a fan of romcoms...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess there is only one thing to do now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  flips the coin. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  stares at the coin, which has somehow landed on its side perfectly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: can we blame magicant physics for that one? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...should I reflip?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no FL, it's probably a sign</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: either that, or coins in peach's castle always do that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh yeah, they spin on their side!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, makes about as much sense as anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... edge means "we keep the illusion for now"????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or maybe we just think it over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that sounds good. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps its paradox space telling us /not/ to leave it to a coin flip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what is he saying on the memo right now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: playing solitare and checkers. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  //typing a summery of 50 first dates --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Has he gotten into a loop yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it looks like he repeated a message. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing he's about as flat as an NPC in whatever town? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More like a computer playing chess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, those messages aren't prewritten.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if he gets into the same scenario, he will respond the same way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, if you ask him the same question twice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except not really because he notices.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh-oh. I hope Nak doesn't break him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, if we tell him, he could freak out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Maybe we could delete a portion of memory?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we keep him in there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, are you sure that's right? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we put him on standby and he realizes he was on standby, things will not end well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I basically wait until he falls asleep in the cot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh, I see what you're planning...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But now, he is going to expect you to get him out...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which if we standby after that, hes going to be upset.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know /how/ the simulation turned back on with him able to get out to the web.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I'm pretty sure I didn't have it set up that way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this is a bit late, but here's a short summery of that one movie. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty much in that movie, this chick forgets the things that happened the day before and thinks that every day is her father's birthday during a specific year,  when really she's been like this for years after a car accident gave her brain damage. meanwhile, her father and her brother have been having to put up with her going through the same routine every single day, almost to psudo-groundhog day levels,</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">but they persist the illusion that it is that day for her, until one day she gets a ticket for having outdated tags and Adam Sandler falls in love with her, even though she's led through this mental groundhog day loop for the sake of her own sanity. The plot was resolved when he pretty much made a tape that she had to watch every morning explaining her condition and the events of the past few years.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so... we should just tell him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nice motormouth explanation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...eheh, thanks. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I think if we want to go that route, it has to involve a great deal of care in how the message is conveyed. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Tell him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, if it goes wrong... we can do the emergency backup plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is to revert to the last time he fell asleep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... we're gonna standby him once he's asleep, then if the explanation goes wrong, savescum him until it goes right? O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats how its done in RPGs!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and visual novels.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'd really prefer a different way, but... I dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know what to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... it's /a/ plan, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh-oh. he's starting to loop with Nak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe they are starting to loop with eachother.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all, there was a large pause and he responded with the exact same text to matching text.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, so ideas for getting him to fall asleep?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...like maybe, tell him the exit door is one of those time delay things, and it won't be unlockable until tomorrow, so he may as well go to sleep for now? or something...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also shit, they ARE looping each other</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmm... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell him you need to crack the password.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we should try and make the excuses as airtight as possible. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I got monitors on his outgoing connection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell him its a 256 bit cypher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that you won't be able to crack it until the morning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, we shouldn't mention the possiblity of opening the thing in the excuse. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: password cracking works. ...also yeah, "time delay" would be responded to with "just have SJ accelerate it"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, what.</span><br />
