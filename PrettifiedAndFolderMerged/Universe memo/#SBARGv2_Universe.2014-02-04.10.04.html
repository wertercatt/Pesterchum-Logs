<span style="color:#555555">CFI: That one guy married his robot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It was in the papers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, a naked singularity is a special type of ring singularity that is big enough that the gap in the center can be traveled through.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Like a Portal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Or specifically, a Trans-locational rift?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is theorized that it might be used as a wormhole, and quite possibly a form of timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, think that's what he's getting at...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I don't have my space physics hat on so I'll have to get back to you on that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell theres even an anime that goes into some being generated by a microwave combined with a cellphone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: In other news! That meteor I strip mined was hiding a very peculiar Ore Source I haven't seen in a decade or two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh? what kind of ore?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and a conspiracy involving CERN</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I might have to go mining again to see if more was produced ORE (hehe) see if I can reproduce it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It's called Nuklonium. It has this, mocha color to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It's a rare metal that is really only found in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is it going to give us cancer? Or is it deep enough in the island of stability that I don't need to worry?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Nope! its not nuclear or radiated at all!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, at /all/?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: AT ALL.</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I need to make another mining expedition~</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I wonder if I struck lucky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: And by expensive I mean like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: A single pound of Nuklonium</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: costs approximately 18mil in galactic credits.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how much does a loaf of bread cost?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: 16 dollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: At least the good bread.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: You can get a loaf for as low as 4 dollars on some planets</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: All known Nuklonium weighs at about 3tons. 8 pounds of which has been turned into a statue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so a thousand times as valuable as gold?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is it more 2 thousand?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you a trillionare?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I found 6 pounds of Nuklonium in that single meteor!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Aaaahhhh!</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Good enough!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: However.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I won't sell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so you could buy 6,250,000 loaves of good brea-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Invest?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I want to use this stuff ofr experiment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: for**</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, you should totally invest it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I guess I can shave off 3 pounds for investment...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Then when I find more I can pull in more cash...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: before gambit catches wind and decided to make enough to buy the entire universe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Gender swapping?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Interesting/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. Gambit's default (and original) gender though is female, so when in doubt, use "she" I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: If I recall correctedly, there were multiple gender swappers among you yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just two others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless we use potions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since magic is real and all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, not sure if we should really call it magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Actually I have questions about that woman that showed up and broke up that incident you were having a while ago. I remeber that they were a gender swapper and also caught their name but the rest is a complete mystery!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all, magic implys its mysterious or supernatural.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm pretty sure if we studied it, it might turn out to be a form of manipulation of physics at the quantum level or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Also that Doc guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: He kinda piqued interest but he was gone pretty fast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Pretty sure Shon is always male.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, Shon isn't a swapper</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: IB is though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I wasn't talking about Shon.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: imagineBreaker, one of the owners of the bar.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox'>http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox</a> Alright, so apparently I've lost access to my customize menu, and we found this page in my clock, so... going from there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It doesn't seem to be straight multiplication, since sometimes it goes x4 and x8... but usually x2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe it has something to do with square roots?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, 6 is multiplied by 4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...perhaps the amount of times its divisible by 2?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: x2, x2, x2, ^2, x2, x4, x2, ^2, x4, x4.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, that wouldn't work with the numbers other than 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's left number done by the thing to equal the right number.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, that second times 2 is also to the power of 2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: good point. 2x2 = 2^2.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 81 is 9 squared...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and 9 is 3 squared... but that doesn't fit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "resulting number" implies 81 is on the left...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... gotta figure out what the operation is there...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 81 is also 3^4, so... hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also, I'm thinking 2 /needs/ to be treated as x2 and not ^2, or there isn't a pattern.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 9 is 3^2, and it was multiplyed by 4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also going pseudo-afk, watching the Nye vs Ham debate thingy))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sorta thinking it might be square roots almost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, "how many times can you fit this number in here" times 2 or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the squares are when the left number is a multiple of four... and 80 is, but 81 isn't...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then why did 10 get multiplied by 4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit, "blackbox1620" is wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (81 x 20)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the number always seems to be multiplied by a power of 2...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how do you know? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: found the link to the black box page in the clock page with comments next to it.</span><br />
