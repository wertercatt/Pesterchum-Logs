<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Also, thats good to hear, SJ.</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: maybe jiggle it a little from side to side</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like, for example, how much X does something need in order to X.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: how much space do i need in order to carry on with this dumb idea that's probably more effort then its worth...</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Maybe ya just need to focus it like Amadeus Cho.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm willing to bet there's some dungeons that can only be accessed in certain time periods, kinda like in Oracle of Ages and a couple other Zelda games.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: part of your land quest could be to bring night and then Day TN</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And SOMETIMES it even has actual weather patterns</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like just a few days ago it was pouring rain</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I don't think that's it??</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I mean I have no idea what my quest was</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: but I seem to have my stuff kidnapped by imps alot</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's like it doesn't even exist</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: It doens't. not 100% yet... cenrtainly not enought to have a physical form.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: also Hi FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, you know, denizens are supposed to ruin your day in general! Be a final boss for the planet, but there's no consorts to be terrified of</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: of it*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: House. Past 3rd floor. Supports Glitchmelted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: so it fell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: My consorts are legless lizards. They are adorable and very nice even if they are stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Awww!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Into the chasm off the cliff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My consorts appear to be golems, made of some kind of mixture of stone and metal and clockword on the inside</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: NV that sounds like a really megahuge, haddron collider deal of a glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No sign of the glitch though... maybe it fell with the house?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Hope so, FL. You're alright, I assume? =(</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I wouldent count on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: doubt it. corruption isn't weak enough to die from fall damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: well if it fell there's more time to get away from it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: even if it lived.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, maybe not the fall damage, but thousands of pounds of house falling apart onto it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: as if it could take damage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, glitch trail ends at the stair case.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the other problem is... what if it's not the only one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what if it doesent have a heath vitle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I don't think its up there any more...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if the health vial is a negative value?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: um</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then use healing items</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: then it glitches until it's out of combat??</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: what if, going back to the Tron 2.0 thing, what you saw was only a basic Z-Lot and not Thorne himself?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: then it dies</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey you there</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Proper use of the word glitch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: +10 points.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the real virus has got to be elsewhere, fucking shit up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: that's what happens in pokemon, at least, except with fainting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: or MMOs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was thinking of a value so high that it wraps into the negatives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: exponents?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, superhigh negitives?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also NV, thanks for reminding me. to fix any future confusion, I told Past Me to do something different in the keytoolKind weapon creation and name it "Copland" instead of "Glitch".</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: did you doom us all?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fuckin. Thank you. Proper nomenclature is always a good thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so no one thinks I'm talking about The Corruption when I'm just giving my keytool a command...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know how with binary if the first number is a 1, its negative?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Copland sounds so much more menacing</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: TN: nope. stable time loop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: OK good</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on a 32 bit number?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I'd like to think it would un-glitch as soon as it would get out of combat then</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and be crushed by your house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: =( sorry that your house got destroyed btw</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what if its combat glitches as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL, only if it's a signed var. I don't know if ~ath is like java and ONLY has signed vars, or like C++ where you can make things unsigned...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it was just the third floor and on...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we can rebuild... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Then I think something deeper is going on here, if its combat is glitched.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: if unsigned vars are a thing, presumably health vials are an unsigned int</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Is there some kind of SBURB spyware?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If not, I launch myself through the gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's usually a Doom player, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: combat glitches typically require a hard reset</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and we can't scratch, so... =(</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and I'm a hope player, but then again, I just got a fraymotif that can fix this. probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...why can't we scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: No beat mesa</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...you sure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: anaywhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I wouldn't think so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well that only means one thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I haven't met anyone with one</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We'd need a Time hero</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: we are a scrached session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For all we know, it could be floating above the glitch mass planets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that would explain the lack of ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: someone call for a time player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles what is with you and Glitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It doesn't make any sense man</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I was just saying why we dont have a beat messa type thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I barely managed to dodge one of those a few days ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: It can only means one thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: we are a scrached session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: FL, would you track that glitch down while I fly over to your planet? What's your planet called anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well post scrach</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: DS, you may have a point. Alternia was a Scratched session and didn't have a Cardinal Movement (iirc). the Void Session... doesn't even have a Land of X and Clock Things since Dave was coming to it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm pretty sure the Alpha session only didn't have a time player because it knew that dave and the others were coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But we do have a time hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So logically a beat mesa exists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is the Land of Steam and Crossroads...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: wow, two crossroads planets?? That's odd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: a scrached univers doent have a means of scraching because it was alredy scrached</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: anyways I'll be heading over there posthaste</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has a large amount of trains.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some people just want to watch the world train.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and the ectobilogy was taken care of by our pre scrach counterparts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I'm bringing the drone downwards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, what would happen if not everything was wiped out by a scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which means... My dad was in the first Sbarg?!?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ditto*^?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I actually asked my parents... no meteor for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we may be like fedora freak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL: me either. we might just be non-ectobabby players</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: hm. Maybe they lied because they were in shock? I mean, I know of several craters around here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but anyway, what if not everything in a session was wiped out by a scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, junk data.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: eek.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: that sounds bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: a reformat that skipped over a few sectors?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One of you guys had the theory this glitch might have been a player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what if it WAS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: oh gog</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ._.;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Uhoh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thats a bit horrorfying</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...hopy shit. Thorne-Analogue is a Corrupted Pre-Scratch Player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thorne-Analogue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I was refering to how it might be like in Tron 2.0</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the bad guy was named Thorne, and he was a User who was improperly digitized and became corrupt</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see, its leaving a glitch trail, has red eyes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I think I may know who else could be a part of it. I've been scanning my harddrives and there's a picture of a girl like me but with brighter eyes; she looks angry in all the pictures... =(</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: no his name was CLU</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and is staticy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tron 2.0 was a different show.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not the movie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: Tron 2.0 was the video game sequel, before Legacy was a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tron 2.0 =/= Tron Legacy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: oh that game</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I thought it was just a light sycle game</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: abd disc wars</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I liked Tron.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It has red eyes, looks glitchy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Shit, I think I know where I've seen it before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And its still alive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: where</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FLY DRONE FLY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ._.;;;;</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nightmares mostly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well, there goes a drone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Frick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: but um.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But in reality no, it reminds me of an Anti-Spiral.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anti-Sprial had white eyes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is a pretty nightmarish thing, and I can see some comparisons</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I got a closer look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, I know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: what do you think about the pictures?? It's starting to freak me out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: hay guys I have to go I ull consentrationhave some things to do that require my f</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Red eyes with yellow where the whites of the eyes should be....</span><br />

<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: OK bye DS</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: wh-wha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was on my land still, so what is THIS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: perhaps a fragment?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: or a corrupted file?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...does anyone remember anything from the previous session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ....whaτ previous session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I can. Sort of. It's not my memories but it's my grandma's? I guess??</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, if some of us weren't meteor children, there may be a chance meteors have nothing to do with this one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Other that SBURB itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: than*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so, what do we do? keep playing the game while we wait for Lazy Guardian to open more Gates, or do we go corruption-hunting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, if it was us in the session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm so confused right now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I am too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Does anyone remember anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that there is a 1 in 12 chance, supposedly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I remember a strange man with a weird symbol on his chest?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, of all of us... does anyone remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...symbol?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: double tier?? something like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think powerKitten said something about it once?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and that's it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: 1 in 12 chance of what? remembering our pre-scratch selves if we had them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Wha...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll have to ask PK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...sounds like a glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: double tier I mean. not PK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, I'm not sure if I actually remember anything, but I found a weird directory on my computer, and it had a few .swf files in it that looked suspicious...</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: my head hurτs...</span><br />
