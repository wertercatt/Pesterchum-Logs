[06:43:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, FF, the story's called "Witch Hunter". It's about what the title suggests. Evil witches waged war on humans and humans fought back. The main character is a really powerful hunter, though he prefers to nearly kill or deplete their energy rather than outright kill them. :&gt;</span><br />
[06:44:42] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Similar to a lot of series, the witch hunters are in teams, except the main character prefers to work solo. What's different is that he doesn't really care as much about protecting his friends as evidence when one of them was possessed by a witch and he decided to shoot anyway. Although subverted in that because of his no kill rule, it was a trainquilizing bullet. :&gt;</span><br />
