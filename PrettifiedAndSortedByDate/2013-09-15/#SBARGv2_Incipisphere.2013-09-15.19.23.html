[20:22:56] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yes. Back on topic.</span><br />
[20:23:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i understand that. i'm just asking cause within all of our given examples and supposed 'laws' or 'rules' the denizens here are different from the others</span><br />
[20:23:48] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH:  Indeed. Many here are more involved with players besides their own, for example.</span><br />
[20:24:01] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i know that</span><br />
[20:24:07] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but as we've seen they /shouldn'</span><br />
[20:24:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so what is it that makes you different from them?</span><br />
[20:26:00] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Because I, along with some others, are interested and involved with you players. I have made a deal with you all, and for that, I needed to communicate.</span><br />
[20:26:21] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well yeah</span><br />
[20:26:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but how?</span><br />
[20:26:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how is it that we understand you?</span><br />
[20:28:23] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, simple. I've had plenty of time to study up on the english language. -And, like I said: We do have good enough vocal cords for talking, so it was really just... learning.</span><br />
[20:28:42] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that doesn't make sense though.</span><br />
[20:29:04] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: How does speaking a language that only two beings can understand make any sense?</span><br />
[20:29:08] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: when Echidna spoke to Jade she had a full understandingf what she said</span><br />
[20:29:15] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but Karkat had no clue what Echidna was saying</span><br />
[20:29:21] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it was garbled and messy to him</span><br />
[20:29:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SE, how does one manage to speak spanish and english?</span><br />
[20:30:19] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's not the question, dumbass.</span><br />
[20:30:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh, but thats /exactly/ the question.</span><br />
[20:30:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no it isn't!</span><br />
[20:30:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
[20:30:48] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: have you read /anything/ i've said</span><br />
[20:31:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SBARG ISN'T PERFECTLY HOMESTUCK, NOW SHUT THE /FUCK/ UP.</span><br />
[20:31:05] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Its just learning another language. It takes time, sure, but it can be done. I could easilly talk in the way only EQ could understand, but that would not be very practical for anyone. It's not like I can only speak one or the other. </span><br />
[20:31:15] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: untwist your goddamn panties</span><br />
[20:31:16] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Players. Calm. Both of you.</span><br />
[20:31:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but it isn't a matter of languages</span><br />
[20:31:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or shouldn't be</span><br />
[20:31:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wow SE</span><br />
[20:31:39] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Echidna spoke to Jade</span><br />
[20:31:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what is your class again?</span><br />
[20:31:44] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Karkat could hear it</span><br />
[20:31:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cause my blood is currently /boiling/</span><br />
[20:31:51] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but couldn't understand what was said</span><br />
[20:31:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not literally, but still</span><br />
[20:32:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Connection Interrupted (HeadThroughKeyboardException) --</span><br />
[20:32:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL, he's not even talking to you.</span><br />
[20:32:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because they have an /extra/ alternative language that is scripted to only work between the player and denizen</span><br />
[20:32:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He's talking to Athena and you're butting in.</span><br />
[20:32:51] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Jade had to translate what Echidna was saying when she was grimbark to let Kanaya know what was being said</span><br />
[20:33:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit, tell SE to look at what Athena said</span><br />
[20:33:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because he sure as hell isn't listening to either of us!</span><br />
[20:33:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but why would it be a matter of languages?</span><br />
[20:33:52] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Echidna was asked to speak with Kanaya</span><br />
[20:33:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but only Jade could understand her</span><br />
[20:34:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: which is why i'm asking how Athena, a denizen whom is not ours, can speak and us understand it</span><br />
[20:35:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because in /that session/, there wasn't a huge period of time for people to adjust, like in ours, where Prospit and Derse were are /peace/ before that got fucked up.</span><br />
[20:35:10] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FL</span><br />
[20:35:15] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this is aimed at a denizen</span><br />
[20:35:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not a player</span><br />
[20:35:24] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, yeah. Through ways I'm not exactly... sure of, You players can instantly understand what your respective denizens say. I can't say that I like the whole "no explanation thing," myself.  But otherwise, it really is just a matter of languages for the denizens and players. Have you ever heard a conversation in a language you don't understand?</span><br />
[20:35:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i lived in canada and didn't know french</span><br />

[20:36:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm not sure you've noticed [pretty sure you haven't] but this isn't a conversation that involves you?</span><br />
[20:36:45] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /why does it matter so much to you/?</span><br />
[20:36:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and she gave me her answer.</span><br />
[20:37:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because I believe in the theory of intelectual osymosis.</span><br />
[20:37:04] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: she doesn't know.</span><br />
[20:37:06] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, its kinda like that, then. A fairly useless language, only to be spoken and understood by the respective player and denizen duo.</span><br />

[20:38:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: after being around /other players/ for three years?</span><br />
[20:38:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically people balance each other to equal intelgence, usually just going down if others don't budge.</span><br />
