<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: he only had 1 HP left</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats what the focus sash does...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It prevents one from being knocked out by limiting them to 1 HP instead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like the undershirt from the megaman games...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The battle network games, to be precise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: hmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I should get around to playing those</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, if one would get knocked out by an attack, it allows the wearer to hang on with 1 HP... after which it crumbles into dust.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Combined with the Regen, I can use multiple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok do you want me to drop you back at your dwelling spire for clothes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Yes I know the orignal Focus Sash only works when it would take one out from Max HP, but I'm going with the slight difference.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I started collecting feathers</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: also, is it wierd that I hear wolves?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I actually see a lot of animals like you might see on earth, its a bit odd</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: Its not large enough</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: any mud slide would be unlikely to even reach the houses</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I wish there was more than just prairies and fear</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I thought mine was going to beboring when i first got here, but sometimes you'd be suprised at the kinds of things that you can find on a land if you look hard enough in the tucked away nooks and crannies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: that actually sounds pretty ominous though</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: which has a sort of interesting quality in itself</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: well the name maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: but its mostly just prairie or burned prarie</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: *prairie</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I guess the sheds are somethin, but its mostly just empty</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: more empty than the surface of an inside-land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: *inside-out land</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some lands have most of their generated structures underground or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: that would be my land, the land of doors and tunnels</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: and the surface is quite literally barren</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I would check except I don't have a way to get underground</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: except maybe a well</span><br />
