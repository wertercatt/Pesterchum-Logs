[12:49] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mine was kind of a dick. But then it wasn't even so much as.</span><br />
[12:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It just operated on a wholely different moral wavelength, it had no real concept of right and wrong just its weird sense of godly duty and dogmatic standards.</span><br />
