<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I always go with water type :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: with the exception of gen 2, the grass starter is my favorite in every gen</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: (totodile is my favorite gen 2 starter)</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: With gen 3, I'm a little divided because I love both torchic and mudkip :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: mudkip is best from a gameplay perspective but he looks stupid, and torchic's evos are 2anime4me</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hes alright but his evos arent great</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But I guess I can see where you're coming from with torchic's evos :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i hope they pick a more non-animu pokemon to get a mega-evo</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: though, you know :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: cause so far its just "blaziken! lucario! mewtwo!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Pokemon is sorta :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: um :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I mean :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: wheres mega-dunsparce, or mega-qwilfish</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: it started off as a video game :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: mega-garbodor</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but it's also already got that art style from the beginning :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yes  but theres so many pokemon that aren't painfully anime</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the first gen is full of em</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and i love that gen 5 went back to that spirit of strange and diverse pokemon</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: my favorite pokemon is a fakemon :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: my favorite pokemon? unironically garbodor</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: TENTAQUIL :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Tentaquil is the best pokemon that doesn't exist :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL:   <a href='http://bogleech.com/pokemon/trash.html'>http://bogleech.com/pokemon/trash.html</a> someboy wrote like an essay on why garbodor is a good pokemon</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: augh my internet :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah, the origins of tentaquil :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so what do you think he was actually trying to draw</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have no idea :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: couldn't have been cyndaquil :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its vaguely swampert-esque</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and couldn't have been tentacool :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: it learns splash at level 100 :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: quagmire maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: quagsire i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Apparently in scribblenauts unlimited, there's a ton of memes you can type the names of and tentaquil is one of them :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but then theres the oddly specific details like the yellow spots on the elbows</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well unlimited has user-created content so</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ah, that's why :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: someone made a romhack called pokemon tentaquil version, though it was largely incomplete and really only good for five minutes of laughs :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe he was like trying to make a digimon or something? never watched it so</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but yeah, at level 12 it learns its signature move, puke blood :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and at level 99 it learns splash :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh somebody made a sheet of r/b/g-style sprites for every pokemon and it also had tentaquil</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: lemme see if i can find it</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ooh :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: tentaquils after genesect</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: hot damn that's awesome :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I wish nintendo would just make tentaquil canon :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: that zorua used to be my something awful avatar</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: smug little asshole</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: when I actually see a zorua, it's kind of weird to picture it as a desk attendant :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh god chimchar</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: buizel's a really smug pokemon too :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: like, get over yourself, buizel :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you  mean floatzel</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: nah, buizel :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also i wish that was actually riolus stock pose</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the buizel sprite doesnt even have a mouth</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: OH GO MEDITITE</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: pfft bibarel</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: the least smug of the pokemon is smugleaf <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh god i remember when everybody called him smugleaf</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and then got mad when he was snivy instead</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: haha :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: well, ED has it listed as Smugleaf :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: in paranteses :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: *but</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: (AKA the new troll face, tsutarja in japanese, or officially snivy) :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: smugleaf~</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ahahahaha that was a thing of beauty</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The only cure is to nickname your Snivy Smugleaf. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i nicknamed my first snivy smugleaf yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but that was during my awful meme phase</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i also named the event victini charlie after charlie sheen because winning</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: shameful</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Anyone else remember that period when the final starter evos were leaked, I think it was? Either that, or it was revealed they were each based of western, eastern, and...some other sensability</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wrestler, samurai, and regal-type</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also can i just say i /hate/ fennekin's design</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its literally a palette-swapped zorua, and that design was pretty mediocre too</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: what's the name of the new starters? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fennekin, chespin, froakie</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fire, grass, water</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: chespin is the cutest :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: froakie's second best :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: fennekin I'm indifferent :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fennekin i actively dislike</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't know if there's any design I dislike :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: especially since i know its gonna end up with some generic-ass animu final stage to sell action figures</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Okay, sorry about all this spaaaaaaaaaaaaaam :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: btw, reminder that shaq fu is one of the worst games ever</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the special moves sometimes just dont work</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Honestly</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I can take or leave Fennekin's design long as it's not another fucking Fire/Fighting</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: like, you will do qcf+kick and its a coinflip as to whether shaq will actually do the flaming roundhouse</span><br />
