<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, it has its perks, but still, I wish that I was back on earth, and the meteors had never fallen... yet, even If I could go back, I wouldn't, because this game has CHANGED US.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You found liquid water?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and the correct answer is "a pizzaria". which I totally found at the south pole of LOSAC.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((haha. I have 69 hours played on that game.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I actually think the answer is how Homestar Runner can hold stuff.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All 5 episodes!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: something I noticed a while ago: the series went on Legendary Infinite Hiatus about a year after Home/stuck/ started.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But yeah, I figure its a form of Limited Psychokinesis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Try and see if they can move objects on the other side of a thin layer of glass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Consorts knowing about pizza?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, the fact they can make pizza WITHOUT HANDS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you seen his consorts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that's probably it. Goombas work on the same logic too</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (Prof. Frankly opening books and stuff)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now try the glass test.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm more interested in how they knew about pizza…</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is it a universal constant?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, my consorts know about Pasta.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They just REALLY suck at making it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, they can make decent ramen, at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dammit, now you have me wondering about Alternian pizza.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except when they put insects in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … And now I need to find out what my consorts eat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm gonna go back to making a killing with the honey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Pffft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just sending it out to shops now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, the Geckos love that stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I'm making a killing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus with the stock exchange, I can do this... pretty much forever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All it costs is grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: are you /seriously/ still fleecing your consorts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I-...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Look, its a decent price.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, I guess so. I was asking more as an ironic joke :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I still feel bad about the accident.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sorry :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why I haven't set the honey to crazy high prices.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, even though I hold a monopoly on the sale of honey on LoSaC, I still want to be a good person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I sell it low enough that I'm making a decent profit, and the consorts aren't having to empty their wallets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, ok. sorry I made it sound like you had gone full Eddy. or Dave, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But Dave did it through cheating the stock market.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't tell the future, so I have to do this legit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And for me, legit is using the money from the honey to get build grist from the stock market to make more honey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Much like how NORMAL businesses charge above the price it takes to get the items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'd probably do it that way too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Lands teaching us about capitalism. Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then when your popluation becomes too much for you to control by yourself, you hire other people to help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is basically what I'm doing by selling the honey to the consort shops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And now I just need to automate the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have the shops wire the boondollars, make the honey, send the honey, use boondollars to get grist, repeat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I only need to install the sendificator upgrade.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I'll just make a system with a mini Alchemiter and all.</span><br />
