<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I... its just that pain exists even after the dojo ends the sim...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus there is the issue of /stopping/ if I go... murdermode again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's true. If you explode someone in there, it feels like they really exploded. :D</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's it matter if it isn't /real/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It lets you try out all sorts of things and do whatever you'd like without any real consequences.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Assuming, of course, you and your opponent don't mind the pain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well obviously nothing would change with you Gambit, but others would suffer from major mental stress due to the pain</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but since we are "all" mad, I guess that doesn't matter!</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: If you can't handle a little pain, what are you even doing in the session?</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, it's not a little. Not if you're playing around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its not a "little" I"m worried about...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Amy, can you imagine the pain one would go through being burned alive?</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: 8ut it doesn't hurt anymore when the fight's over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's possible to feel phantom pain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you still have the memories of the pain... you still remember the suffering... and what gambit said</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Especially if you use sticky, liquid fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It obvs sticks to you, so… it still sorta feels like it's there once you've derezzed the sim.</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: Oh... I didn't know a8out that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: ((you people need to make everything a federal fucking issue dont you))</span><br />
