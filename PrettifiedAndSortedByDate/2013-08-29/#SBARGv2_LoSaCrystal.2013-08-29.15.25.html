<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think it works the same way First Guardian gender does: based on what they're prototyped/ectobabbied from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: also, pretty sure the gender ratio for Eevee's is 75% male.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *looks around with interest*</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - Various tools and machines lie around in disarray. In the middle of the room is a mysterious ring shape laying on the floor. There is an elevator at the back of the room, which the guide walks over towards. -</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *kicks her skeleton over towards the nearest machine, examining it to see if it's interesting and what it does*</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - It's just stuff typical of a large-scale coal mining operation. These clearly haven't been used for a while. -</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  looks up at CA from under her hood, giving him a light smile before shoving her hands in her pockets, walking along with them --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  checks the elevator. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: What's this, then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *unfortunately has no idea how coal mining works and as such checks to see if there's a pickaxe lying around*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#008282">[CCA]</span>  smiles back at FA and looks around at where they've found themselves --</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - Gambit got an Iron Pickaxe! Unfortunately it's almost broken :P -</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: So<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span> uh, what was this mine place for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I have no idea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: mining? what else is a mine for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: *shrugs*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *hands the skeleton the Iron Pickaxe*</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - PA: It's a big circle about eight feet in diameter, with a foot of width beyond that. Other than some mysterious shapes, it doesn't seem very useful. -</span><br />
<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: Precious metals? Coal? It could be anything...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - The guide waves from the elevator. - "Dungeon entrance is here, comrades."</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The… strange black dust on Skelly's pickaxe says coal, maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or /explosions/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *guides her newly armed skeleton mount over and into the elevator*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't think explosions are a mineable material... so probably coal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads over to the elevator --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT patchworkAttendant <span style="color:#b3b3b3">[CPA]</span>  closes her exposed eye, the left the only one open at this point, but what good will that do? Enough, evidently; the hidden eye takes on a Space symbol in the pupil as she tries to investigate more closely, see if maybe this is part of another structure or if anything of intrest lies below the ground. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: спасибо, Comrade.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  heads enters the elevator. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT patchworkAttendant <span style="color:#b3b3b3">[CPA]</span>  is doing a kind of x-ray space vision thing right now just for the record. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT patchworkAttendant <span style="color:#b3b3b3">[CPA]</span>  frowns, before eventually shrugging and reopening her eye to head for the elevator. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: is everyone here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I think so?</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  did follow. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - As the elevator reaches the bottom, you look out and see... a pretty big mineshaft. They weren't kidding about the size of this. -</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: ((I got a playlist for basically this whole dungeon, but thanks anyway ;) ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: Hmmmmm</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: whoa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIN: - Off in the distance, you see minecarts zipping by, destination unknown. In front of you is a turntable, pointed in the wrong direction, and a sign ironically warning you not to walk on the track. Which is stupid, because how else are you getting through here? -</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I swear I've seen this place before...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *by flying herself and her skeleton (aaah heavy) over to investigate one of the orange blocks visible in the picture?*</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: maybe?</span><br />
