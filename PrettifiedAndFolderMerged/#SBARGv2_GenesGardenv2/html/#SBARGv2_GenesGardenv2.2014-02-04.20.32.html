[08:32:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[08:35:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so, prime numbers and powers we seem to get...</span><br />
[08:35:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I think we get it.</span><br />
[08:38:26] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Are you quite done throwing calculators then?</span><br />
[08:39:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we're working on some dumb math problem puzzle thing that's probably a diversion of some sort. ➜</span><br />
[08:39:49] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Oh.</span><br />
[08:39:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: honestly, I'm more interested in why the puzzle was posted than the actual answer. ➜</span><br />
[08:41:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( PING ))</span><br />
[08:41:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I'm wondering about that too...</span><br />
[08:42:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((poooong))</span><br />
[08:45:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...and I have reached the point where I can't help no more. ))</span><br />
[08:45:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wonder what the pattern to the multiplyer powers is... ➜</span><br />
[08:45:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( becuase that would solve it. ))</span><br />
[08:45:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((alright then))</span><br />
[08:47:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm still trying to figure out the odd ones... since  6, 9, 10, and 81 aren't prime numbers nor powers of two... and yet they go past the times two to the power of one limit that prime numbers have...</span><br />
[08:49:02] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that is kinda weird... ➜</span><br />
[08:52:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing it's probably going to be a four digit number at least larger than twelve hundred and ninty-six... ➜</span><br />
[08:53:32] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so that at least narrows it down a little bit... ➜</span><br />
[08:53:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm gonna fill in the other ones that fit the pattern we found for one...</span><br />
