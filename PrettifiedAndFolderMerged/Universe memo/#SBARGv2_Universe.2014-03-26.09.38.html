<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Just checking in...even if it is pretty late...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, it is kinda late. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...How are things?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alrightish, mostly. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...mostly?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I assume you've checked the tags lately? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the whole situation is just plain troubling. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...That it is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I don't know all the details, but from what I've heard it...isn't good either way...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah...... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...If you wouldn't mind...would you give me the short version of it?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I can do that ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...i would appreciate it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay so, there was a trip to a creepy crypt, we accidentally released her, the group went to a space library to find answers, a bunch of her crew was there. Apparently her session sucked and she didn't buy that so she's going against the system now ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so she's trying to seek out the <span style="color:#bacafe">Heart of the Universe</span> to somehow end the SBURB cycle. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (pretty sure it doesn't work that way, but a threat against the universe is bad enough) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (shrug) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is that short enough? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah...that's rather...unsettling...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I should look more into this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: we need to figure out how to kick this chick's αss</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I can probably think up something...but I don't want to say too much just yet in case things don't go...as planned...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: understandable. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'd also rather not have certain information out in the public domain...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah....... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...You never know who might be listening in...especially with someone who's able to do what they do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, are we seriously going to go paranoid like how it was last time? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Eh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Maybe it's just my inner Rogue talking...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I swear, it made the memo way too quiet then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I dunno...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Just the fact that there's someone who's threatening Gene has me on edge...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wish I wasn't such a horrible person... so willing to dispense information without any regard for the consequences... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Besides, do we know what these people are capable of yet?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: too much, that's for sure. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...That doesn't make you a horrible person...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...A horrible person is someone who takes advantage of people using that information...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: look, I followed the group that let her go, and I told her where starter planet was over the memo, now tell me why I'm not a horrible person. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: why the fuck did you do thαt?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, how was I supposed to know her handle back then? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...But why would Starter Planet be of any consequence? We created it when we first arrived, right? It's not an original part of Gene...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the point is it's where she find a lot of us. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *she can ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and considering she's been rumored to be able ot BLOW UP ENTIRE PLANETS... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: now do you see why I'm a horrible person? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...You are not a horrible person...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: sj, do the group α fαvor αnd shut the fuck up</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: nobody cαres if you hαve loose lips</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .../FI/...wait, what?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: loose lips sink ships</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I know that much...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I just...wasn't sure what you were getting at...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: αnd it doesn't do αny good to bαdmouth yourself over your pαst</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah, don't beat yourself up about it. Nothing good comes from that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I should get some sleep soon. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I think we all do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: i need to get bαck into trαining with my scythe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Luckily, mastery over the Breeze basically means mastery over my weapons...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Though I do have to test a couple of things...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Niki...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Don't beat yourself up about all of this, ok?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda hard when there's serious consequences behind stupid actions. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, I'll be getting to bed now. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Listen...doing all of that to yourself is only going to make things worse for you. Instead, maybe think about things you can do now and in the near future to help...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess I could try that. but for now, I'm tired. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: goodnight ➜</span><br />
