[09:16] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((lurking))</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: A good vast majority of us were setenced to a stupid game. We lost all our family members. We lost loads of friends. Pretty much everyone we knew died. All at the hands of a mad man's single decision. We had to fight armies. We had to fight followers. We had to fight comrades that turned on us. And then we fought the mad man. And it was no easy fight in the slightest.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: We lost everything.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Except the ones you see around here.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I've heard you talk you never even fought the mad man, you didn't even know the madman existed. You were never even around.</span><br />

[09:18] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That is how I know you are an awful fucking liar.</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: To be honest you could see that battle from anywhere.</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: You didn't need to be on the battle field to witness what happened.</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So shutup. Whatever violence you people have seen if you think I am it not only have you never known violence, you have never even seen the fucking sun.</span><br />
[09:19] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Charles is not the person you are talking about. That Rob guy isn't either, and I can assure you nobody thinks about the things they lost.</span><br />
[09:19] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I will listen when you are not trying to fuck my ears without any kinda protection.</span><br />
[09:19] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT vermillionShark <span style="color:#c8382d">[CVS]</span>  just smiles. --</span><br />

[09:21] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: I won't.</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You don't know the first or the last thing about me! You don't even know number fucking 3 on the list! I bet you only thought it was 1. Burn</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Wrong.</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yet /I/ am the burninator, I am violence, I am fire, I am death! I am literally a genocidal maniac.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: You're not.</span><br />

[09:23] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Every moment I have been here I have been pushed around and kicked around for absolutely nothing besides a bad attitude and that's /sometimes/.</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: When I first came here I got shit thrown at me, then I got groped, then I got put in a magic time out bubble by those stupid little magic power children.</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Charles threw swords at me without even asking me my name, I got /bombs/ thrown at me.</span><br />

[09:24] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Somebody called me a coward and said they wanted to fight me. They shoot me with lightning, kick me into trees, and when I land a punch they try and attack my /friend/.</span><br />

[09:27] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: To be honest I'm not that insecure.</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: And then I get mad, because that's bullshit. And then we have stupid cowards like the ghost and like Jacien where if their brains exploded they wouldn't even lose a /hair/.</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Then you need to get laid.</span><br />
