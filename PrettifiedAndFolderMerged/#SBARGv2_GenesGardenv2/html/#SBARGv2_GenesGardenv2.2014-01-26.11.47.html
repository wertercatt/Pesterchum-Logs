[02:03:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Prince of Space?</span><br />
[02:04:34] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the prince class, as you alredy know, is a destroyer class. And when paired with the aspect of space implies a focus on the active destruction of space, as well as actively destroying with space. ➜</span><br />
[02:04:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that can mean quite a few things. ➜</span><br />

[02:06:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but really, destroying doesn't have to have a negative end result. ➜</span><br />
[02:06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh yeah, Antimatter reactors!</span><br />
[02:07:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, you could bring things closer together by destroying the space between them. ➜</span><br />
[02:07:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or you could crush an object enough to apply enough pressure to cause nuclear fusion in a fusion reactor.</span><br />

[02:10:09] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Why a bard?</span><br />
[02:10:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: beause that one tends to fall more along the accidental destruction side of things. ➜</span><br />
[02:10:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: at least according to popular classpect theory. ➜</span><br />
