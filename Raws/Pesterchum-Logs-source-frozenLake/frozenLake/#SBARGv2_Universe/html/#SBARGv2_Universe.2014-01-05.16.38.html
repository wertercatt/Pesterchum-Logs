[04:39:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause he never had those before.</span><br />
[04:40:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed. Huh.</span><br />
[05:09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, Kimura.</span><br />
[05:09:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How good are you with those brush portals?</span><br />
[05:10:06] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: what did you do.</span><br />
[05:10:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what FF said.</span><br />
[05:10:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...nothing.</span><br />
[05:10:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: now I'm sad.</span><br />
[05:10:39] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: The triple-dots are not convincing anyone.</span><br />
[05:10:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm serious, I didn't do anything.</span><br />
[05:11:12] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Why are you sad?</span><br />
[05:11:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sad since me asking about a method of transportation makes one automatically reply "what did you do"</span><br />
[05:11:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Am I /really/ that terrible?</span><br />
[05:12:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh... force of habit.</span><br />
[05:12:39] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...You can be at times. Sorryy.</span><br />
[05:12:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, why do you ask? also thanks for reminding me I was gonna distance-test my portals at some point.</span><br />
[05:13:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, can they go to a position that you have never been to? That is three light years away?</span><br />
[05:13:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the middle of space?</span><br />
[05:14:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... well, it's always been a bit harder to portal to somewhere I've never been before, but maybe...</span><br />
[05:14:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you know the exact position, would it be possible to portal, is the question.</span><br />
[05:15:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug?</span><br />
[05:16:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all I can get us within a kilometer.</span><br />
[05:16:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With the tracking.</span><br />
[05:17:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the other problem is, a longer distance requires more ink. and while my regen rate is close to instant because of the badges I made, there's still the cap on how much can be done in one go... so I really dunno.</span><br />
[05:18:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...how far are the consort moons? that's probably a good test.</span><br />
[05:19:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 light seconds away.</span><br />
[05:20:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So if the consort moon is your /furthest jump/, it would take 31536000 portals to get 3 light years away.</span><br />
[05:21:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also FL, the main thing is, I'm not a Space Player, and Brush Portal is probably considered a Space-type move. so I would still not be able to use it to its full potential as a result... also mmk, guess I'll see if 3LS works.</span><br />
[05:21:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember back when your Brush Portals cost grist?</span><br />
[05:21:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Man, it would /suck/ if that was still the case now.</span><br />
[05:22:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dang, I forgot that was a thing actually. it was probably because I was still low-level and had recently protoed.</span><br />
[05:22:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, brbconsortmoon</span><br />
[05:26:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...well. that was interesting. it worked, but took a bit to be able to jump back. so I'm guesstimating 4-5LS is the max per jump, or around that level.</span><br />
[05:27:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so we can't get to the distress signal with kimura.</span><br />
[05:28:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...I still wonder why toast-workingness seems to be flipped today. CP-StrifeKind is toastable, but CG-Defaultpester isn't.))</span><br />
[05:31:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((hmm... having a limit makes me wonder, for later purposes, how to exceed it. because the concept I have for my tumblr-RPing thing is that he's learned to brushportal anywhere, but for trans-dimensional travel, he has no way of controlling where he ends up.))</span><br />
[05:32:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, CP hasn't climbed all the god tiers ))</span><br />

[05:33:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((like, maybe the Skeleton Key unlocks the range limit, and the lack of control is because trans-dimensional travel is HARD))</span><br />
[05:34:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: .</span><br />
[05:34:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((How many god tiers are there to climb, exactly? Is it ever mentioned if theres a limit, or does it just go on forever?))</span><br />
[05:34:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Pretty sure the Skeleton Key was Caliborn Exclusive. ))</span><br />
[05:34:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I think Vriska saying that John had climbed all the things, but not quite /all-all/ of them implies GT rungs have a limit too))</span><br />

[05:35:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( inb4 there are 2^64 GT rungs ))</span><br />
[05:35:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((anyway, guess we'll see when HS ends... unless Hussie leaves it up to fanon interpretation like he's doing for claspect stuff))</span><br />

[05:38:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...wait a minute, that kinda sounds like a void thing... could it be a reference to the short period of time FL spent as a void player? ))</span><br />
[05:38:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( unintentional references for the win ))</span><br />
[05:39:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, CP's early bit of videochatting with his future self ended up working out with his swap to Time...))</span><br />

[05:46:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Kinda find it weird that it kept randomizing the classspect pair... I wish it had forced a "remaped table" onto everyone. ))</span><br />

[05:47:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((hmm... I know in Hotel, Take had it since there was no in-universe reason for him to have Brush Portal... but I see your point.))</span><br />
[05:48:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Mist Warp could be infinite-range but limited to mirror locations, while Brush Portal is arbitrary location but limited range.))</span><br />
[05:48:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Question is, what counts as a mirror? ))</span><br />
[05:49:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, /special/ mirrors actually. not any old reflective surface.))</span><br />
[05:50:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, whats the plan for going after this ship in distress.</span><br />

[05:50:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure. we need someone with a warp drive, or a Space Player...</span><br />
[05:50:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've managed to get a decent translation.</span><br />
[05:51:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Big Engine(?) is offline. Air is low. Assistance is Requested."</span><br />

[07:06:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, yeah. At least with the method I use. ➜</span><br />
[07:11:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, have you experiemented with adjusting the anchor point?</span><br />
[07:12:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not really.  ➜</span><br />
[07:12:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm</span><br />
[07:13:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I have an interesting concept.</span><br />
[07:13:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Try and use the moon as your anchor point while on the ground.</span><br />
[07:14:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wouldn't that be kinda dangerous though? ➜</span><br />
[07:15:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you can use the moon, you could eventutally use a computer to calculate the ammount of time to travel along with selecting anchor points in deep space to go all over.</span><br />
[07:15:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, wouldn't using a remote anchor increase the chances of temporal tele-frag? ➜</span><br />
[07:16:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, not if you can predict where the stuff is going to be.</span><br />
[07:16:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like using computer simulations.</span><br />
[07:18:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it would be a lot safer to use a timeloop-protected moving object as an anchor and then when the object gets to its destination, switch anchors and recalibrate to the correct time. ➜</span><br />
[07:18:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, that might be kinda tricky to set up. ➜</span><br />
[07:18:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I'm trying to figure out methods for space travel.</span><br />
[07:19:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I doubt that timeloop insurence works that well. ➜</span><br />
[07:19:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can warp into one place in deep space, and back to this planet, so I'm limited on my warp options.</span><br />
[07:26:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, it seems to be instantanious.</span><br />
[07:26:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's the one place in deep space, FL?</span><br />
[07:26:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I have no idea.</span><br />
