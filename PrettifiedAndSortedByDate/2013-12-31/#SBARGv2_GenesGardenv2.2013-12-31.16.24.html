[07:57:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's okay FL, you couldn't test it so you didn't know it was going to fail like that.</span><br />
[07:58:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I should have accounted for murphys law.</span><br />
[07:58:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I /knew/ something would have gone wrong, its just too high of a chance knowing paradox space.</span><br />
[07:58:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh. You made a miscalculation on something you couldnt test out before. Honestly, that sort of thing almost always is struck by murphy, so I don't really blame you much on that.</span><br />
[08:00:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I should have seen it coming.</span><br />
[08:01:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Nah. Like I said: Murphy is bound to strike most always. Can't really blame yourself for bad luck or a miscalculation or two.</span><br />
[08:02:17] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...You did do a test run, right?</span><br />
[08:02:30] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Or simulations?</span><br />
[08:03:02] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: He couldnt. It would have spoiled the surprise, if the test run would have been seen. Simluations can also take up time, so...</span><br />
[08:09:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not like I could have asked a time player, as that obviously would have caused a paradox.</span><br />
[08:09:17] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: huh... oaky</span><br />
[08:11:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...IB, could I have some lemonade?</span><br />

[08:22:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((besides, since this problem has happened the past /several/ versions of both firefox AND flash player, I'm thinking it's not just the browser that's the problem, but the hardware.))</span><br />
[08:23:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Chrome's custom, built-in flash player plays more nicely with my hardware than firefox's standalone flash so idk))</span><br />
