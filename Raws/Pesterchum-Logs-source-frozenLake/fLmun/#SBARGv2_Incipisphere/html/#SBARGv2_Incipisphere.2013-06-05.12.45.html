<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Morning Folks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT kaMi [CKM]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
greeting: hello FL<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Who are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just don't recognize you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Should I just google it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#4274c4">CURRENT shadowsPaintbrush [CSP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: Wouldn'T BE SurpriseD IF He'S ThE OnE RunninG SbarG</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Some sort of supernatural being?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm willing to bet that its someone's AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: FLmiN ProbablY</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, its not mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless I made it and forgot about it, which is unlikely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Sort of think it might be CP's</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I won't know until later.</span><br />
humor acknowledgement: that is a humorous conclusion you have reached.<br />
continuation: even though it is wrong. or perhaps because it is wrong<br />
laughter: ha. ha. ha.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry guys, but I'm gonna crash this guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THIS STATEMENT IS FALSE</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: AnD ThiS IS WhY i Don'T DO MakE ArtificiaL IntellegancE</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: *-DO</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, that was anticlimactic.</span><br />
pregnant silence: dot dot dot<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, either we have a stupid AI, or this guy can understand a paradox.</span><br />
realization: that was an attempt to induce a logic paradox and ensuing system crash.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
addendum: such a tactic was so far below my ken i failed to acknowledge it in any way<br />
admonishment: that was a very dumb thing you just tried to do.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And now I will begin to feign stupidity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In an Ironic fashion.</span><br />
perceptive observation: your claim to feigning stupidity will no doubt be brought up again as a shield against the many slip-ups you will no doubt make.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Are you real?"</span><br />
conclusion: you are trying to cover your own ass when really you are just a dumbass.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...screw It i'm not gonna feed clever bot into this thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be rather pointless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So instead, I will ask questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you abide by Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics?</span><br />
answer: as i am not in fact a robot but a GI i do not<br />
you need not worry though i mean you no harm<br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff660d">CURRENT squealingVermin [CSV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Interesting stuff going on over here.</span><br />
unless you consider the wicked burns i will no doubt be regularly inflicting on you harm.<br />
"oh snap" algorithm engaged. back up protocol "no he didn't" kickstarted.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, Sarcastic AI/GI/whatever it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: What is this with animatronic entities and sassyness?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Do you care about man's well being?</span><br />
clarification: my progenitor deems me unfit for classification as AI, artificial intelligence. he deems my existence as more akin to GI, or genesic intelligence.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Genetic*?</span><br />
personal note: i think he's being fancy/splitting hairs. and would rather his creation not be know as something as pedestrian as AI<br />
personal note 2: i do not mind though. AI or GI work equally well.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, what sort of hardware do you run on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And are you based on a self adapting program, or a human mind?</span><br />
answer to inquiry 1: i care about the well-being of my progenitor and those he calls friends or comrades. which is most of you. mankind on the whole is beyond my range, and irrelevant to ponder.<br />
answer to inquiry 2: i meant what i said. genesic, relating to or sourcing from genesis.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh. That is interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: SO WhaT, You'rE LikE ThE FG OR SomethinG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, the First Guardian isn't an AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hes a bird.</span><br />
answer to inquiry 3: more then advanced enough. more detail would likely reduce your simpleton brain to mush, as it is substantial and mostly irrelevant to the course of regular conversation<br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: WelL, ON AccountS OF BeinG a "GI"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is it some sort of quantum computer?</span><br />
answer to inquiry 4: i am based on a digitized blueprint of my progenitor's mind, given the ability to self-repair and adapt.<br />
answer to inquiry 5: i have no relation to your first guardian. although he seems like a nice guy he's nothing to caw home about.<br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And even trough /all/ of that, you fail to amuse or stun me with your heightened presence.</span><br />
answer to inquiry/comment 6: my progenitor presumably did not like the stigma of the word "artificial".<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I understand.</span><br />
and thus went about crafting a new moniker for me. as i said though i feel it is at least in part, if not mostly, due to wanting to stand out.<br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And even through /all/ of that, you fail to amuse or stun me with your heightened presence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And who is your progenitor?</span><br />
proofread: successful<br />
answer to newest inquiry: i could tell you, but i believe it would be more entertaining to watch you guess.<br />
in addition it is probably not all that hard to figure out.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Judging from the change in name text color, I would have to say... SV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: You're more than an idiot than I thought.</span><br />
indifference: this is me, neither confirming nor denying that guess FL<br />
inquiry: were you referring to me SV, or to FL for his guess?<br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I was referring to FL.</span><br />
understanding nod: executed<br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: i Don'T ReallY CarE. AS LonG AS YoU Don'T BitE ME IN ThE AsS LateR IN MY LifE i ReallY Don'T HavE a ReasoN TO QuarreL WitH YoU</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Inquiry to the AI: Do you have a body, or are you only an artificial/adapted intelligence working to advance in the form of sheer intellect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a8a87e">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I want to know, but I think that I have other things to do.</span><br />
inquiry response: i have little in the ways of a physical presence, but that is not to say none at all. my form may manifest on a semi-physical plain under certain conditions, vis-Ã -vis a digital ghost.<br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Are you perhaps entwined in the sprite network for that matter?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like... Making an upgrade to the security of my computacts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: I don't think so. sprites are created by a player entering the game- I don't think there is any other way to make them.</span><br />
i do not think so. whereas a sprite might touch objects and otherwise interact with the physical plane, even in my semi-physical form such things are beyond me. it is mostly a means of transfering my digital footprint from one area to another, when routing along data lines would be ineffable.<br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I'm pleased to meet you AI.</span><br />
response: it is a pleasure to meet you too, SV.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, managed to boost the security of my computacts</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Is there a name ya go by, Kami?</span><br />
at this point in time, undetermined.<br />
concrete answer: for now, just kami is fine.<br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: I don't think so.</span><br />
my progenitor did, at least.<br />
i believe it was as a method of taunting me.<br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Huh... well Kami is actaully a term fro a spirit of power.</span><br />
that fits, interestingly enough.<br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm doin' already myself...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Learning a little more about my land lore, and such. This sunken city's a relic of the ancients, apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or I should say, the Ancients.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Star Gate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha. </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you say indeed I am- oh. Okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The civilization that came before this one... The penguin consorts that run the land, that is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Still don't know much about them aside from they were crazy advanced for their time and they could tap into some arcane forces that drove development even further.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or so one of the archaeologist penguins told me he'd learned already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There're a bunch of... well, a fair number of them. They've even got a nice camp set up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And they won't stop until they solve all the mysteries of this place. They're real glad I opened it up with that last dungeon, too... clearing away the fog was instrumental. And they're quite the change of pace from the wizard pengies.</span><br />
