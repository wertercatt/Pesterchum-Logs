<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sendificator shenanigans</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't come over</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I can fix this</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, how are you doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The box isn't too small, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, already did the prank earlier</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also what happened to you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay thank god</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so its just a one time glitch maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why, what happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: did the boxes spontaniously shrink or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: um no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: infact from my perspective you could say they are massive</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, my other guess is that /you/ accidentally shrunk yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ding ding ding</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm worried about what would happen if Lucky Mallet was used on me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since it wasn't caused by one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't wanna become issun sized to issun</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...great. so what do we do then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and what were you doing standing on the sendificator pad anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets not ask silly questions like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, what /do/ you want to try? the Resizing Funnel, since you apparently made it at one time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't want the cockroach incident again</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well anyway, should I come over so we can at least figure things out in person?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sure let me deactivate the security again</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, was that you that just warped in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: BH?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: did you or one of your friends warp into my house just now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though I did just have an idea. lemme get a thing and I'll be over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well fuck we have an intruder</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see if I can trace where the teleport came fro-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WHAT THE FUCK</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, major intruder alert.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: I saw someone earlier FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: what do they look like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know, the cameras are offline</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: oh jeez</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I think I saw a flash of cyan</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: it was some guy with a mask</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: but I don't think they weren't wearing anything cyan, thats for sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: *were</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'm bringing over the Reversible Changing Chopsticks... they're the thing that lets Issun become /human-sized/, so it should solve your problem FL...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: that sounds like the spoon from kerero gunso</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, its not moving torwards me if the pattern of the destruction of cameras matches up</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its moving torwards... well fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...towards me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, CP, how much do you like the internet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its going after the alchemized ring server</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well it is creating a major source of quantum disturbance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so that might be why it came here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: shall I make my way over?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, get me out of here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'm at the point where HR and I accidentally your glass door yesterday. how do I get to the server room from here? or better yet, where are /you/ at?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll send out the robotic drones to hold it off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: I'm heading over</span><br />

<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: wait what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to think about this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The air vents don't lead all the way to the server, we can head him off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: so if its a sanic</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: oh nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: let me void up a cage for this asshole real quick</span><br />

<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: still making a cage</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The hedgehogs hatred seems to be directed to humans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: and me</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: seriously it was like it was targetting me</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And CP comes across close enough to a Mobian that he might think he is a slave or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh wait, just had an idea. but FL, I'm gonna have to set you on a table first...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: table you say?</span><br />

<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: ignorance is no excuse</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know what he would want, but we should send CP in to gather information.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: damn vigilantes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course this issue is made worse considering it seems to be one of /my fan characters that I designed/</span><br />

<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But there might be several differences.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: don't you know better</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: it looks like some kind of re-color...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: /what/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I know a few things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He is rather adept at swimming, and can preform the spin dash and spin attacks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is also quite likely that his weaponry is powered by Chaos Drives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And considering they contain power collected from chaos emeralds, it is likely if he has enough, he can simulate the effects of the fake emerald in Sonic Adventure 2.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would likely take seven to match it though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if he has enough... well, thats how I knew the super form was coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, due to the fact the power is limited, he would not be able to maintain it for any period of time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it is likely he will be rather drained when it ends, if it hasn't already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That escape into the airvent might have been an attempt to give him enough time to rest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Camera right outside of the Server Chamber has been destroyed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, you should arrive shortly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#c50000">CBH: tell me when I should go over there ima go eat</span><br />
