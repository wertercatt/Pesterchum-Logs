<span style="color:#887000">CSL: in 2013</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have no idea what is even with this connection. I'm guessing it was set up incorrectly or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dialup technically isn't supposed to exist anymore. but apparently that part of the Digital Broadcast Transition from years ago never actually came into effect &gt;_&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: I need food in my food box, bread for my aching head...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sorta tired, but okay mostly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: How long have you been awake?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: since 7am</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which was 2 hours ago from my time zone</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: I've been awake about two hours getting water in, morning routines, it's time for food though, and then some herbal remedies for my hangover. I will be back later, snap back like a gator?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: That work for me, it's too early to rhyme everything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, it's all cool. sometimes breaks are a nice thing to have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just wondering, are you any good at puzzles? because there's this really stupidly hard one that a couple of us here are trying to crack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and we could use some help</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: I am a puzzle whizz, but are you concerned that my not being a part of the story will constitute cheating?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's all cool, there's excuses in store for those outside of the session.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: thought I had a breakthrough yesterday when I tried parsing the dots as holes in a captcha card (or as ones and zeroes for traditional base64), but nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the excuse currently in use is trans-timeline internet connection allowing those from the timeline where the session never happened to be able to communicate with those from the one where it did via the internet connected by the horrorterrors in the furthest ring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda convoluted, but it keeps the 4th wall mostly intact.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: whoa :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: This is a tough one! I'll have to consult my puzzle wizards and see what their magical means can divine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thank you</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: The problem is I have no idea the state of mind the puzzler was in, or even a hint as to WHAT to look for. Is it a message about a apocalypse or like, can it be anything like "THIS IS HORSESHIT" spelled out in descending order somehow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: that itself is a puzzle, PE :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and don't worry FL, I had a plan actually [cough]thatIjustmadeup[/cough], that the "six players" thing was a mistranslation, and it's "six beings", so the consort guide would count as the sixth.)</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: As one newspaper called him, Andrew "Hussie" Hussie :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hussie actually plans everything out</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Even he admitted that he doesn't plan everything out :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He originally intended act six to be much shorter than act five was :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and /now/ look at it</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He has a pretty good idea of what the plot is :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that was my favorite part of the comic</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: was the alchemy</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: my favorite part was the midnight crew :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I hope the game has some examples.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who partook Kickstarter anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I paid for the game, if I recall correctly :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But not a physical copy :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I don't know if I paid for the soundtrack too :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just have to make sure to get as many additional people in as we could...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We would need a time player to tell us when to close the chain.</span><br />
