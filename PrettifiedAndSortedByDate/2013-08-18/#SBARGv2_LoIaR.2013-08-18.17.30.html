[05:44:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, besides needing to look at the library, anything interesting happen so far today?</span><br />
[05:46:30] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *stops zoning out* Wait, damnit... I gotta be somewhere.</span><br />
[05:46:31] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA:</span><br />

[05:47:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Ash is upset... I'm kinda worried, but I know that I shouldn't bug her right now...</span><br />
[05:47:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CMA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[05:47:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: is it the same stuff as the past few days, or something new?</span><br />
[05:47:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know.</span><br />
[05:48:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I still think part of it is the adjustment period to being animal-tier...</span><br />
[05:49:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: She was going on about insults again...</span><br />
[05:49:30] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has just disappeared*</span><br />
[05:49:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just... bugs me, knowing I can't help.</span><br />
[05:50:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like a fish in an aquarium...</span><br />
[05:50:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: having to wait to be fed.</span><br />
[05:50:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />

[05:51:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...kimura I can't understand barking.</span><br />
[05:51:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: was that directed at me and was it important?</span><br />
[05:51:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he's just asking what's going on</span><br />
[05:52:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah, not really.</span><br />
[05:52:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, I just kinda feel like I can't get out of this "aquarium" and do something with my life.</span><br />
[05:53:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think a lot of us feel that way in general, really...</span><br />
[05:54:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
[05:55:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I entered because in my old life I couldn't do what I wanted...</span><br />
[05:55:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and I still can't.</span><br />
[05:55:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, thats my reason other than meteors.</span><br />
[05:55:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, meteors was my reason too :P</span><br />

[05:57:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah, only had my dogs at the house.</span><br />
[05:57:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: my parents were at the airport picking up my grandma...</span><br />
[05:58:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...If they survived... they would likely think I was dead.</span><br />
[05:58:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't think they survived though.</span><br />
[05:59:04] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: .........</span><br />
[05:59:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I can't remember, were you there for the second trip into the Submachine?</span><br />
[06:00:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because the end part basically took place on Earth, or at least a simulation of it. and it was as desolate as the exile scenes in HS were...</span><br />
[06:00:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No, I wasn't.</span><br />
[06:01:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I remember there being television programs about bunkers.</span><br />
