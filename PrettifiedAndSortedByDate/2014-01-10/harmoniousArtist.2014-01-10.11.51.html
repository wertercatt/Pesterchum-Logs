[11:54:46] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: yeah, i'm from the moon and it's pretty cold here</span><br />
[11:55:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Um, which moon?</span><br />
[11:55:22] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: that red one with white stripes</span><br />
[11:56:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Right, sorry, never heard of it.</span><br />
[11:56:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Doesn't sound like its from a universe I'm familiar with. Could you tell me more?</span><br />

[11:57:15] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: I know, no one seems to</span><br />
[11:57:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So uh, what is the planet that the moon orbits like?</span><br />
[11:58:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Or does everyone live on the moon?</span><br />
[11:58:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: For all I know, you could be in some sort of wacked up session.</span><br />
[11:58:49] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: well... we live in tribes both moon and planet</span><br />

[11:59:45] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: sorry, it's my robot...</span><br />
[11:59:56] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: The don't work very well on the moon</span><br />
[11:59:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Ah, okay.</span><br />
[12:00:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So you have a tribal system... what sort of technology does your race have?</span><br />
[12:00:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It sounds fairly advanced.</span><br />
[12:00:59] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: it's simple! we use leaves</span><br />
[12:01:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...You built a robot out of leaves.</span><br />
[12:01:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Actually, that doesn't sound that crazy anymore.</span><br />
[12:01:58] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: ^.^</span><br />
[12:02:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So, I take it you use mechanical computers?</span><br />
[12:03:22] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: kinda, trees on our planet send wi-fi signals, so they don't really reach the moon, that's why i'm having problems with my connection</span><br />
[12:03:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Oh, thats actually really interesting!</span><br />
[12:04:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What is your culture like? Do you have any sort of ruling party incharge?</span><br />
[12:04:09] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: but where are you from?</span><br />
[12:04:32] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: we dance to make decisions</span><br />
[12:04:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, the simple answer is that I live on a planet in another universe that gods created.</span><br />
[12:05:16] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: are you living on that blue planet? i don't really remember its name</span><br />
[12:05:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its not really blue.</span><br />
[12:05:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And we haven't really named it yet.</span><br />
[12:05:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Wait, are you refering to a version of earth?</span><br />
[12:06:04] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: earth! that was it</span><br />
[12:06:10] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: do you live on earth?</span><br />

[12:06:30] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: oh gosh what happened to it?</span><br />
[12:07:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, my version of it got wrecked by meteors... that might never happen, or might be in the past or future for you.</span><br />
[12:07:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Transuniversal communication is confusing</span><br />
[12:07:26] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: im sorry</span><br />
[12:07:52] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: i know right? it' so difficult to communicate with other universes</span><br />
[12:08:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Er... do you have any temples with a large amphibian ontop?</span><br />
[12:09:38] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: no, but we have ME! :D</span><br />
[12:09:48] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: im the first prioress here</span><br />
[12:10:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, it seems your planet and moon are safe from what took out our planet.</span><br />
[12:10:33] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: i'm sorry about your planet</span><br />
[12:10:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its fine, it would have likely destroyed itself anyway.</span><br />
[12:11:05] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: i actually vaguely remember a temple but i think it got destroyed</span><br />
[12:11:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Like, our people had these bombs that basically slamed into the ground and unleashed an explosion that looked like a dying star.</span><br />
[12:12:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And they ended up damaging the surroundings so much noone could live there for a long time.</span><br />
[12:12:16] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: man that's sad</span><br />
[12:12:27] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: ill pray our gods for you</span><br />
[12:12:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Um, what are your gods like exactly?</span><br />
[12:13:16] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: well... there are more than 100 gods in my culture</span><br />
[12:13:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[12:13:35] <span style="color:#18447a">HA: they usually are similiar to us</span><br />
