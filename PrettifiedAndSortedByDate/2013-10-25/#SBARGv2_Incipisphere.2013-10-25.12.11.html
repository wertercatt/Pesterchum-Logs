<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Looks like I can /finally/ be of use to this session.</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CWD: You never took my words to heart didn't you</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Okay see the fact that I /knew/ you were going to say that FL just makes it all the more worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might as well be a test subject... Its not like I would be good at anything else...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Not with that mentality, you won't</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Interesting!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh, in that case, I would likely ruin the tests</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: keep any and all methods of time travel away from me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: You never listen to anything that will actually better you, and you keep focusing on how much you're useless. Then again you're probably covering your ears /as usual/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: God knows it would only end in a doomed timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I guess I /might/ be similar to an Espurr... naw. That doesn't fit me at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...Hm. Hey Niki, you're not participating in the tournament are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...did I get the placement of the I and E right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: No, but does it matter?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, actually I don't think I've seen you in-person for a while WD...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((KH, you might want to leave the pirates memo, you left it open))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Mm, well! Just a little worried about people knowing stuff I'm going to use for the matches, so as long as you don't tell anyone else we'll be cool!</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Besides I missed seeing ya.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Mind if I come by~~~~~~</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, uh, so I shouldn't come over to watch since I'm in the tournament?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Prooooobably not. </span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fair enough.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: water balloons? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to calculate the code for the Matriorb (just because I am bored), but I am having some slight issues... ah well, I'll figure it out soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far, I have the code for a potted plant and a certain fedora (god bless Shaving Almanac &amp;&amp; T-Bone Steak), but I'm having issues finding a copy of Charles Duttons Dream Bubbles... but I will get it soon.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: I'm going to ask how you even knew he was rambling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I heard through the grapevine that someone was trying to do something stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that wasn't meant to be a captchacode. that was a response to RS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: He literally /just/ started.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Except with stupidity instead</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I may have mentioned</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Oh well that would explain it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll be honest Charles is kind of the butt of all the jokes I have with Rob</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, aside from the ones that I'm the butt of, but those are mostly insults.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably different category.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah those are palsy-insults I have like 8 categories of insults</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: This doesn't surprise me in the least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I'm just doing it as a test for reverse engineering codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's play this game, then. Why would you want to do something like that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its something that I feel that I am /decent/ at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So... because you want to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I want to go down as someone who /actually/ knew how to calculate codes for punch card alchemy instead of getting a gravestone with "Idot" written on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Honestly I don't think there's all that much to be explored as far as alchemy is concerned, beyond seeing what something might make with another thing, or some shit like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Recipe Modus states that the Hard-Boiled Fedora is a Potted Plant &amp;&amp; Dream Bubbles || Matriorb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far, I have the Hard-Boiled Fedora and Potted Plant codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cz!Z!l!k and CuPA8LnQ respectively.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So you're saying you're trying to figure out how to get the codes for the other two things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: And what exactly do you have to benefit from this, other than being known as the guy that messed around with alchemy a lot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a perfect process, But I can narrow it down to say, 2^18 items so far for what /might/ be the code for Dream Bubbles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: That doesn't answer my question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I can get the code for the Matriorb, I could potentially get the code for other items that may be more importaint to us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: See, this would be more credible if you actually had something that everyone could agree would be a good idea to figure out how to get without having obtained the code in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You had such a good streak of being semi-cool, too. Like last night was actually pretty great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we might not need to know the item we need /now/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And now you're dedicating yourself to a process whose fruits you don't even /know/ for the sake of, doing something worthwhile?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let me save your time. It's not this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but eventually, you might see something in the Recipe modus that you might want</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Reverse engineering canon item codes when we've got a perfectly good trove of unplumbed things here? Seriously?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I'm /bored/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not like I got anything else to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Why not try going into a dungeon? Your land has those, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: make things that aren't from video games</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: or from a pre-existing canon</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You don't even need to drag anyone along just take one on solo, I do it all the time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The last dungeon I have on my land seems to be an... extra dungeon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 100 floors of pain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, Pit of 100 Trials. which neither of us have done our respective lands' version of that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a80000">CURRENT fromAshes [CFA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Does everyy land have one? /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're telling me there are /no/ more dungeons on your land? You did them all? And none of them repeat or anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Ash, no, I think it's kind of a rare spawn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mine has one because of the source material used, not sure why one also spawned on LoSaCrossroads...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Christ whatever happened to good-old adventuring? Dungeons with some fights and puzzles, maybe a mini-boss or an end-boss. Sweet loot too of course, of some sort or other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or side-quests. Consorts are /tripping/ those things. Absolutely tripping 'em.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either my land fucked up with the dungeon generation (only spawning necessary dungeons) or they are buried so far into the land I will never find them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Likely the Second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a motivated attitude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So motivated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You want something to do? Find your dungeons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's a nice way to spend an afternoon. Explore your land ,see if you can't find any pathways leading underground, figure a way underground to get to 'em</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: speaking of afternoon, is the tournament opening gonna be soon? my "prior obligation" got moved earlier to 4:30 PST.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((since I'm bringing food, I have to be at the party by five))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 64 possible codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I could narrow it down further.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: 64 codes for what, the book?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Matriorb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I figured out the code for the book, I could likely bring the codes for the matriorb down to about... 8.</span><br />
