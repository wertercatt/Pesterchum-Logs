<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is there an afterlife?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is it just cessation of existance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats a secret</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((also im really not comfortable establishing any canon on that front))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((I'll talk to Kaylen about it for ya))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right, So I'll just believe what Samsprite told me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: considering he didn't remember any sort of afterlife... but It could just be wonkyness on the part of the prototype process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: could be</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I don't remember an afterlife from that long period of time I was dead so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe it just wipes our memories when we leave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like maybe reincarnation is a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Possiblyy /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I believe in it, personallyy. Reincarnation i mean /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and we just lose our memories of the afterlife normally.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wouldnt delve too deeply into the question</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just let it happen when it does</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ heh /)</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what did i miss</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Silas kinda made me think about it with the way he just... let that soul vanish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Mayybe when we die we'll end up Reincarnated as one of the planets civillians and become the protag of our own Fantasyy adventure series /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i like that theory ash</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was a while back</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((ftr my headcanon is that theres a heaven-like place with like a reincarnation gate))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since /someone/ was trapping souls in masks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((but i dont want to make it canon just yet))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: who is someone</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (fuck I'm trying to answer two questions at once.)</span><br />
