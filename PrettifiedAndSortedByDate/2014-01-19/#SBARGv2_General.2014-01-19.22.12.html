<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: there needs to be more stuff about eldtritch dark gods and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: not enough fiction out there playing with the idea of entities beyond comprehension.  beings that invalidate reality and existence with their own existence</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I wonder what it'd be like to own a weapon that had an eldritch entity bound to it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, you can't ever just leave that sort of thing alone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So, a lot of responsibility would of course be a part of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: hmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I've noticed a lot of people lately when they refer to, or when someone includes eldritch entities in a work, they tend to be like</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: bargain bin elder gods</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: communicating with them can bestow upon you mysteries of the universe if you can survive the experience!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: when it should be more like, there is nothing to learn</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: nothing to understand</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: they are not just beyond the laws of our universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... its too late to be thinking about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: they are beyond our reality, beyond any form of comprehnsion of existence</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: they are not just beyond reality as we understand it, they are beyond it as it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: in the face of them reality loses its meaning</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: what's the point of understanding in the face of something that doesn't just invalidate the concept of reality, but the concept of the the concept of reality</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <a href='http://angersexual.tumblr.com/post/73931227905/pokemon-fans-fluff-water-and-fire-types-are'>http://angersexual.tumblr.com/post/73931227905/pokemon-fans-fluff-water-and-fire-types-are</a> is that a dorito tree? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: now I want a grilled stuffed nacho</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: but like, take something as horrible and incomprehensible as a being that invalidates invalidation, and force it into a reality</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: into a place that THRIVES and depends upon definition</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: how do you define the undefinable to when it's undefining the attempts to define it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: course even then it's wrong to say it is something taht undefines because that in itself is defining it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: and the human need to define things is why they drive us mad</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: our minds shatter under the pressure of trying to describe a thing that is beyond us.  it breaks and bends and twists.  it seeks understanding and never finds any</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: so you go mad.  you either lose your mind or you change your mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: the only way to survive is to go insane and force yourself to see a pattern that doesn't exist</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: and with that i should probably sleep...</span><br />
