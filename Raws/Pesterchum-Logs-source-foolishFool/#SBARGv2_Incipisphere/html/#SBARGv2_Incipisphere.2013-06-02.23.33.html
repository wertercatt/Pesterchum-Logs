<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: oh yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Depending on how you treat the issue of "another entity's knowledge of reality is being joined with your own", you may experience...well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: I just noticed that the chumhandle changed while I went to change devices</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: the problems of having two simealtanous views and experiences of the same information battling for supremacy in one mind</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Do you need help or are you fine</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I have no clue if I finished my land quesτ somehow or noτ..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but I still haven't found the intended endpoint for my land quest yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I mean...I τhink I purified my denizen of her corrupτion?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Thankfully, I managed to get back to LOGAM before everything went sour, and actually made some progress on my task in the land</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: Corruption?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: via baττle in my consiousness?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: fascinating...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhough iτ wasn'τ really much of a baττle</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It was very silly...I thought I had to Remake the Mirror then Revive the Ghosts</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But as it turns out</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I need to do those in order as subquests</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: then, quite naturally</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm almost done with my land quest because it's getting progressively more anticlimactic. And I should really get back to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Unify</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: again, iτ was a baττle in my head</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: ah yes that's right</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: one cannot be too careful though</span><br />
<span style="color:#51c1fc">CMG: ~ ._. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I would have been a puppeτ if I didn'τ τry τo fighτ her, τhough...</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ "the knight of astora can be found at the final broken ALTAR OF SUN"</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Lose-lose situations are never pleasant to deal with</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ where the fuck is that</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: oh my</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Well</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Presumably somewhere near the other broken altar of suns</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Seeing as it appears to be the final one</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: Good graciousness I should pick up the pace</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: I'm still working to figure out what I am even supposed to do</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I'd argue you're not too far behind</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Recall the fact that only three Gates had been unlocked, and that by some accounts</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT:  I mighτ have somehow sequence broken iτ a liττle</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: This session had safeties built in</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: to allow this session to go on for years</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: if need be</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ from my understanding</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ i would have to get killed by the dragon</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ god tier</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ kill the dragon the second time</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ but that didnt happen did it</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Eheheheh.....</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And don't worry, the first and last 'parts' are mostly the most exciting</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: My mighty task as hero/saviour/dominator of this Land at present is to literally pick up broken shards of glass and weld them together into bigger, still broken shards of large still broken shards of one of eight Mirrors</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aha. when in doubt, go bark to the Secret Wizard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *talk to</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (lol @ my quirk)</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The grinding is horrendous</span><br />
<span style="color:#51c1fc">CMG: ~ I'm not even on my planet right now. Xp ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently, the Wizard is like one of those fortune-tellers in games that tells you what you're supposed to do next if you're lost as fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or at least that's one of his purposes</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh man</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I remember once on the Chumosphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: some guy was raging because he had sent his bedsheets off to be laundered before he entered</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: so his Secret Wizard was dressed in nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, to finish my actual land quest, I have to max-level all my brush techniques, and then the final task is-- oh frogs what EU</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: try finding your helper Consort when he's dressed like approximatly 96% of the Land population instead of the unique entity he's supposed to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: --the final task is to go on one more trip around my land, using all 14 abilities to fix everything, finally ending up at the Fahr City Big Bomb Cannon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then after I defeat the denizen, I will get some kinda land instrument I have to play to actually wake the land or something?</span><br />
