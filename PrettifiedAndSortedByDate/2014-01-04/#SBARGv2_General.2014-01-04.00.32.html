<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, there's always the back-logs that can be read. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but its different yknow</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I know, it is kinda different. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...side note, what was your rationale for having seth being so cool with ben stabbing him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the fact that he was so relieved to not have to deal with the lag anymore. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: heh, guess that works</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: my ooc justification for doing it was the same as my ic justification</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: payback for the space jam funeral? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because somebody had to do it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the justification was that he needed a reboot, the death was not heroic or just, and even if it did somehow turn out to be, he was a maid of life</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, I was actually glad that there was somebody that wasn't a complete weenie about the deal. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sl is not one for moral crisises</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hes very black-and-white</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hence why fl is "evil", instead of stupid or impulsive</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, that's interesting. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Aaaah, okay. That explains quite a bit, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh, now I get it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nobody ever realized that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: SL is monochrome. Canon</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Shrug. I generally see everything so grey, its basically fogging up my glasses. I just never noticed that distinction. Interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its one of his character's driving forces</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: SS stayed out of everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: so much so he disappeared</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: for 6 months</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: when there is a gray area, he does everything he can to resolve it into black or white</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And that is how you avioid conflict, everybody.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: *avoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Also SL, now that you mention it... yeah it makes a lot of sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hence why hes so obsessed with reviving quinn and amy, he feels like if he can bring them back then his negligence as a father/boyfriend will magically go away</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh well then. I see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess you could say that SJ is mostly optimistic about others except for when they prove themselves to be complete unredeemable jerks or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'm surprised nobody even jusτ leτ my char die (τhen again)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: really, no one ever picked up on that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: If SS ever did interact with everyone, well, he's a centrist.  his needs come first.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: if stabbing you works out for the best</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Noodles is just insane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: he's gonna stab your ass</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: As gambit reminded me, my char is the only person in the "only died once, wasn't brutally murdered" club.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Or, thats what she said :U</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meanwhile, she /really/ had it out for CP when she was being mind-controlled or cursed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...on the bright side, his black-and-white stuff does mean hes much more willing to call out people like gambit and charles on their shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: tbh, I don't know how much of that was "cats &lt;3&lt; dogs" and how much was legit animosity for him as a person</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c9c9c">CBS: ❧MASTR SORD MIN</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: since hes already determined they are "evil" and as such when everyone else is trying to be diplomatic hes like "no, you cant just stab everyone you fucking moron"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: on the other hand hes much less willing to acknowledge their positive aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: The only downside with that is it rarely stops anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Seriously, Gambit was called out on her shit how many times, yet was still shanking people on a near-daily basis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sort of, except also hell point out how fucked up something is when no one else will acknowledge it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fair point</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and make everyone else do something about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT Noodles <span style="color:#0000aa">[CNN]</span>  is just going to leave now. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: behind his facade of douchery and such, sl is a very simple person</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: id even use the adjective "traditional"</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'll jusτ sum up my characτer as "unhinged"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: snrk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mine always tries to see the good in everyone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...man, even i hadnt thought about the black-and-white aspect that much...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think his self-loathing in relation to amy's death isnt just that he killed her</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its that he killed her after being a good father</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: case in point, after the chronos battle he /thanked/ Tarbutt for causing the Battery Incident that led to his self-proto.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he wishes that he were either the perfect father, or a child-killing madman</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that was nova</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah he would be much happier as a cackling supervillain than as the complex person that he is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because he wants the world to be simple, black-and-white</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...heh, i dont think hes even mad at himself for killing amy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hes mad at himself for doing it accidentally</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: for what</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: my existence here</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I whine a lot just to get someone to pay attention, sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: eh, we all do it occasionally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I do it all the time though</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not really</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: yes I do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no, you really dont</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: compared to someone like ae or even nn</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean its not that you never complain about life issues, but its not a constant thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: that's because I rarely say much, it just seems like that because they talk much more than I do, most of what I say is complaining</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean i dont know what you want me to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because what youre saying isnt true</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: youre an active participant in the memo, you contribute to stuff, and occasionally you complain about problems youre having</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that sounds like everyone else here tbh</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: are medium to long</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, the friend who does my haircuts told me once that japanese standards of hair length are different than american ones...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: hair stops being short the moment it starts to grow past the base of the ehad</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: maybe that's why</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: still</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you remember to -long and -medium to the search results? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, one "stage" longer (our medium is their short, etc)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: i did not add that, but i dont think it's going to help at this point</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: just to have references</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: but ultimately it's going to be up to whoever does the art and character design for my manga as for what the character's hair winds up looking like ultimately</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and speaking of my friend, I need to pester him on FB and see if he's back in everett so I can get a haircut soon :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I just find it interesting, cause i've got two characters that are of Japanese descent in my manga.  The girl has really short hair, while the guy has medium to long hair</span><br />
