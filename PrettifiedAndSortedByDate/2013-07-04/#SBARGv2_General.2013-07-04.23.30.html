<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I am very confused right now on what's even going on in this memo</span><br />
Insanity, obvs.<br />
Sanity is /so/ like pumpkins.<br />
This is the philosophy for the night.<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: blacktext of ambiguous originin a room with at least 3 irc users</span><br />
DUDE WE SHOULD PLAY A GAME<br />
THAT GAME IS "GUESS WHO'S TALKING"<br />
Switch identities?<br />
Anyone on IRC can't play 'cause we're dirty rotten cheaters<br />
cheaters who CHEAT<br />
So, switch identities?<br />
We get it dear. Sure.<br />
YES THAT EXACTLY :D<br />
Mhm.<br />
Oh this will be fun<br />
Of coures it will be...<br />
You have no idea.<br />
*course<br />
Actually, I'd like to think I do.<br />
idgaf what you like<br />
so suck it bitch<br />
Are you sure about that?<br />
...<br />
Quite sure. This won't be the first time I've tried something like this.<br />
… Alright then.<br />
See this is why you don't snort Jane<br />
At least if you overdose, I suppose, you won't die.<br />
You don't snort Jane, you snort coke.<br />
I snort Pepsi.<br />
The narration cannot die obviously, and thusly will continue to snort Jane.<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what about pepis</span><br />
Will you get to Heaven though?<br />
Pepsi and Mountain Dew.<br />
No, but I /will/ rule Hell.<br />

I think my blood is partly made of Mountain Dew now…<br />
We are all so fucking high right now.<br />
No seizures for you then, I guess.<br />
High on Jane.<br />
Yes. I will not have seizures.<br />
My plan is great.<br />
Motherfuck I have work to do.<br />
Sleep deprivation will make you high.<br />
You also have /us/ to do.<br />
My body is ready.<br />
That explains so much...<br />
...<br />
Don't even question it.<br />
I know I do, but baby I have to get this done by the morning.<br />
… If I ever have a kid, I will name it Work. And then people will be all "I have work to do". And it'll be "Work… or /Work/?" The word work now looks like it should rhyme with spork and has lost all meaning.<br />
I have potato Duece on my computer but why....<br />
omg<br />
I'm going to have to have two kids, because I still want to name one Crazy Stubborn McLastname.<br />

NY &gt;3&lt; PD.<br />
And clearly not straight as hell.<br />
No, as straight as the narration!<br />
So not at all.<br />
… The narration does not discriminate.<br />
It is equal-opportunity.<br />
And violent.<br />
Mostly violent.<br />
Who is PD?<br />
Neither does this state since July 24, 2011.<br />
PD is PD. He's new here.<br />
*highfives NY*<br />
PD is the police department.<br />
Obvs.<br />
*is a state; therefore cannot highfive*<br />
… the first NY handle I came up with was narwhalYahtzee.<br />
