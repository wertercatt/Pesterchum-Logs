<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what stuff did you have in mind, DS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YEARG!</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: goodness</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: y-Yeah, tell me about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Can you get me off this sword?</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: he only had 1 HP left</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats what the focus sash does...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It prevents one from being knocked out by limiting them to 1 HP instead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like the undershirt from the megaman games...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The battle network games, to be precise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: hmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I should get around to playing those</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, if one would get knocked out by an attack, it allows the wearer to hang on with 1 HP... after which it crumbles into dust.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Combined with the Regen, I can use multiple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok do you want me to drop you back at your dwelling spire for clothes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Yes I know the orignal Focus Sash only works when it would take one out from Max HP, but I'm going with the slight difference.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Sure.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some lands have most of their generated structures underground or something.</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Unite them under y✮ur leadership, then lead them f✮rth against the gates ✮r the Palace</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: so I just need to play that, huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I guess its worth a shot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: I really don't know if it will work</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: that's why it is merely a suggestion</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: should be easy with this Breezy Machete</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I probabely just need to get high enough and get a good gust of wind together</span><br />

<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: I stopped part way through when I realized I had summoned a sufficient breeze</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: The breeze was being extracoperative and made a giant wind storm</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: so getting the breeze together is done</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: but there is more I have to do, apparantely.</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: ✮r even YEARS if we l✮af ar✮und! :✮</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: but now the crops can spread around, so thats good</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: apparantely next I have to quill a great flame</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: so like... brush fires.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: The breeze is because of how dry the prairie is theres bound to be plenty of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9500ff">CLN: so I guess my quest is just me harnessing the breeze in proggressively larger ways</span><br />
