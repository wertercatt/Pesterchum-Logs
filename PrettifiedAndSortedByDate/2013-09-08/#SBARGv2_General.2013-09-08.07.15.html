[09:44:13] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Okay :&gt;</span><br />

[09:44:22] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though I kind of have to go to work. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:44:31] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I can stay for about 15 minutes :&gt;</span><br />
[09:44:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah work is important.</span><br />
[09:44:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: to half an hour? :&gt;</span><br />
[09:44:51] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I mean, my alarm clock is set to 8 am and it's 7:45. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:44:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If fine, you can go.</span><br />
[09:45:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its fine*</span><br />
[09:45:02] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: So what's up? :&gt;</span><br />
[09:45:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nothing other than me beginning to talk to myself</span><br />
[09:45:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: What about? :&gt;</span><br />
[09:45:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: jokes</span><br />
[09:46:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, I guess that's not so bad. I assumed it was something bad when you said "oh god don't leave me alone" :&gt;</span><br />
[09:46:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example "I guess gold hurts, as silence is golden"</span><br />
[09:46:48] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Wow, both deep and a joke. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:47:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or "hey what time is it. /quiet time/"</span><br />
[09:47:00] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Sounds more like something in a poem than a joke :&gt;</span><br />
[09:48:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe</span><br />
[09:48:45] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: You know, I should probably not admit it because private things ought to stay out of public :&gt;</span><br />
[09:48:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#e69900">CURRENT foxMulder [CFM]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[09:48:58] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ We like yQur private things ;) ♫</span><br />
[09:49:04] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: But last night I was having trouble sleeping because of the way I wa feeling about things :&gt;</span><br />
[09:49:44] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, I feel like I often go unnoticed or I'm easily forgotten about or easily forgettable. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:50:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats not as bad as feeling sorry for a fictional character's writing hand...</span><br />
[09:50:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously what is /wrong/ with me</span><br />
[09:50:58] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and as some people know, I often feel left out of things. And usually the reasoning others have is that they either forgot or never thought to include. Which shouldn't worry me, since it doesn't mean that I'm being purposely excluded from things, right? :&gt;</span><br />
[09:51:11] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ EP y◙u are definitely nQt easily f◙rgettable ♫</span><br />
[09:51:13] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Right ♫</span><br />
[09:51:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:51:24] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: But it still does worry me, because it makes me feel like I'm easily forgotten :&gt;</span><br />
[09:51:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wow I just realized the hotel hasn't happened in /two weeks/</span><br />
[09:51:39] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Nah, maybe peOple figure if you want to be included, you will speak up ♫</span><br />
[09:51:53] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: maybe :&gt;</span><br />
[09:52:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: it's just more a matter of, many people in the memo get invited to things or are included in things by default and then forget that I exist. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:52:43] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Maybe sQmewhere they g◙t the impressiOn that you didn't want t? be involved? ♫</span><br />
[09:52:49] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, there was a sort of intro thing the other night for PE, but it wasn't an event, so you didn't miss anything. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:53:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah</span><br />
[09:53:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
[09:53:09] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm planning on having an event this coming Friday :&gt;</span><br />
[09:53:23] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: So I can finish what I originally started :&gt;</span><br />
[09:53:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL is going to actually make those pens over this 3 week period of time.</span><br />
[09:53:54] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FM, in some cases that could be the case, actually, though I don't know if it falls under every case. :&gt;</span><br />
[09:53:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, hotel version.</span><br />
[09:54:14] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: hotel version of pens? :&gt;</span><br />
[09:54:22] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ When y?u were 6n vacati0n from <a href='#F'>#F</a>, pe◙ple were asking f?r y0u every day ♫</span><br />
[09:54:32] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: that's true :&gt;</span><br />
[09:54:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hotel version of FL</span><br />
[09:54:43] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Their w?rld was crumbling :D ♫</span><br />
[09:54:53] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: though they're a little /too/ noticing of me, imo :&gt;</span><br />
[09:54:58] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ LOl ♫</span><br />
[09:55:00] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ We l6ve you ♫</span><br />
[09:55:24] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I was more talking about this group :&gt;</span><br />
[09:55:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: the friends in pesterchum :&gt;</span><br />
[09:56:56] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Qh :3 ♫</span><br />
[09:57:03] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ I haven't been here lOng enough t? observe ♫</span><br />
[09:57:08] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ S0rry f6r interrupting ♫</span><br />

[09:57:17] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I like the input :&gt;</span><br />

[09:58:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah... I like input too at times, and sometimes I actually /want/ someone to say my stuff sucks.</span><br />
[09:58:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: instead of lying and being overly positive</span><br />
[09:58:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT existentialPenguin <span style="color:#133295">[CEP]</span>  nods --</span><br />
[09:58:31] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I like to reassure people, but I can see how that could be bad :&gt;</span><br />
[09:58:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sadly I assume lying even if they aren't, so....</span><br />
[09:58:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://pastebin.com/0atbiGiS'>http://pastebin.com/0atbiGiS</a></span><br />
[09:59:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like with that, as noone has said anything negative</span><br />
[09:59:21] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: lemme see it :&gt;</span><br />
[09:59:48] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: oh, fraymotifs :&gt;</span><br />
[10:00:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda have Charred Coda nicknamed as "ALL BURN"</span><br />
[10:00:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: hm...not sure if I can make an opinion on them :&gt;</span><br />
[10:00:47] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: as with many things in homestuck, despite having theories of my own, I don't really know a lot about fraymotifs :&gt;</span><br />
[10:00:51] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and what would make good ones :&gt;</span><br />
[10:01:36] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I mean, I know they're sort of like "special moves" like limit breaks in final fantasy games :&gt;</span><br />
[10:01:48] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: but they tend to correspond to the aspect :&gt;</span><br />
[10:01:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, what effects are severely OP?</span><br />
[10:01:59] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and I'm not well versed in the aspects :&gt;</span><br />
[10:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the jump from 2 to 3 apsect frays might be... too much.</span><br />
[10:03:28] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm not sure what to make of heart 3 :&gt;</span><br />
[10:03:57] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: heart 1 might seem op in the sense of "can avoid any attack". Even though it doesn't say any attack. :&gt;</span><br />
[10:04:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its the equivelent of the Parry from Wind Waker.</span><br />
[10:04:49] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: ah :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:05] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I could probably let heart 1 slide, then :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also matrix shit</span><br />
[10:05:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Fraymotif effects aren't permanent, right? :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, they are not</span><br />
[10:05:50] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Okay, that's good :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:54] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Then heart 1 is okay :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They wear off after a period of time.</span><br />
[10:06:02] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: it would only become op if it never wore off :&gt;</span><br />
[10:06:24] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just gotta be wary of how long the motif lasts for :&gt;</span><br />
[10:06:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh my god could you even /imagine/ that for heart 2?</span><br />
[10:07:16] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: unfortunately, I haven't looked at anything past the first three hearts :&gt;</span><br />

[10:08:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Soul Tempo is strange in that it doesn't really wear off like other fraymotifs</span><br />
[10:09:38] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah...I'm still not sure what to make of the soul tempo :&gt;</span><br />
[10:09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, Soul Tempo is what allows FL to /move/ the souls... it doesn't /keep/ them there.</span><br />
[10:09:49] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, I really just don't know what to say about it :&gt;</span><br />
[10:10:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah, its a bit of an oddball</span><br />
[10:10:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its like heart swap in pokemon, but... different still.</span><br />
[10:12:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CLL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[10:12:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heart/Blood is actually sort of a planned Fray between FLord and FL.</span><br />
[10:13:44] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: In about half an hour I need to go. I'm gonna take a shower. :&gt;</span><br />
[10:13:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright</span><br />
[10:14:01] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Hope talking with you helped you a bit, FL. I'll be back for a few minutes after the shower. :&gt;</span><br />
[10:14:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, good luck with work</span><br />
[10:16:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just realized with the price of FL's frays halving each purchase... you only need to save up /just/ under twice the orignal price to get it for everyone in the session.</span><br />
[10:17:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so one will need 2 octillion boondollars to get SBURBan Finale for /everyone in the session/</span><br />
[10:18:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...this is the greatest good bad bug in existance of gaming</span><br />

[10:19:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if it can't be a bug then I'll go with the excuse that its simulating the economy enough that the price is actually /able/ to be lowered.</span><br />
[10:32:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, do you think it would be possible for a massive session to ever save up 2 /billion/ /boonBONDS/?</span><br />
[10:32:51] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have no idea. :&gt;</span><br />

[10:33:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would be 2 Million Boonbanks, or 2 Thousand Boonmints.</span><br />
