<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe that I may be able to take care of this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have created an AI thats primary function is to interface with anything in a digital medium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you would be so kind as to deliver this AI to the Prospit Code Room and plug it in, I would be most grateful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: CP, are you listening?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The code is "s3tSgL!3".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, if you may hurry, I might be able to adjust some of the variables to give us a fighting chance.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /Wait a second/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Made an AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And now you want someone to plug it into the code room, giving it probable unlimited power insofar as the code of our session goes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: # that won't go totally wrong at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do not see the problem with this.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT issunJar <span style="color:#39b873">[CIJ]</span>  speaking from the POV of actually having been an AI once, but is now a physical being because shenanigans --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I simply wish to help the players of this session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and that's exactly what chronos said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /i really don't think that's a good idea/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /why would it even be necessary/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /why/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Everything will be fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Trust me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The AI has been programmed with the three laws of robotics, if you are worried.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Also for the record, from what I understand, you *can't* just install things randomly. They have to be properly formatted and have a code box already there for us to do that kind of hacking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you not heard of the plug and play technology trope?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: FL. Zeroth Law bro.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: ((fuck you laggy pesterchum))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: From my experience, SBURB tends to run off of this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: See.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This worries me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: (Me too, just play along...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (you do know he can read stuff in parentheses)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No not for the reason you are...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Not entirely that reason, at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which reason are you speaking of?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How is one able to explain the sburb disc running on a large ammount of systems, some using differing processors even?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: That's not plug-and-play. That's just Weird Predestination Shit making sure the Frog Temple has the code for every OS the players will be using.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am not convinced.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Besides, the AI will mostly be running in a seperate location.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This is just a transmitter, to allow it to interface with the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All I require CP to do is to plug the transmitter into the code room, so I will- It will be able to repair the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Well, in any case you'll still have to wait for Kimura or another Prospit Dreamer to get back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT issunJar <span style="color:#39b873">[CIJ]</span>  pretends he didn't see the freudian slip the size of Planet Fucking Juipter ;) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Interface with the code. Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would do it, but my dreamself is otherwise incapacitated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Somehow the fact that you're programed with the three laws just makes it worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do not see the issue with it being programmed with the three laws of robotics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you were to explain, that would be most helpful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You can't just create an seperate existence and stiffle it like that. Imposing limitations like that just leads invariably to those limitations being exceeded at some point, and when that happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Maybe the fact that, over the years, so many loopholes have been torn in them they wouldn't even hold a drop of sake?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Actually, RS said it better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The AI will not harm any one of you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I promise this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: riiiiiiight...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I sense doubt. SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: obvious doubt</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you have anything to add?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe it'll start questioning its own existance and ask FL all kind of uncomfortable questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or shall we begin with the installation of the AI?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sigh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Alright, I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would I lie to you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Made Kami.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Just... The way you're pushing... You're not making your case any better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: FL already figured it out probably and everyone else could probably tell too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Judging from the way you are speaking, I assume Kami is no more?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What? No, Kami's still kickin' and well!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was assuming with all the talk about issues with AI's that you needed to destroy Kami.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Why the hell would I need to or want to do something like that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would take care of installing the AI, but the house is currently surrounded by underlings, and I am unable to send out any drones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Underlings're swampin' Charles' place?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Also, what I meant earlier about the Code Room not being plug-and-play... I meant that in terms of how the room works in Wreck-It Ralph (which Chronos obviously Jurassic Parked that code fragment from). You have to do some REALLY weird shit to introduce foreign code from the inside (Turbo becoming King Candy, Ralph and Felix adding the Q*bertians to their game).</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would recomend avoiding the dwelling spire at this time, as the turrets are currently set to auto target anything that is moving.</span><br />
