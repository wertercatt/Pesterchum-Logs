[22:53:47] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: *what</span><br />
[22:54:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I knew there would be issues back at the meteor, I fucking called it.</span><br />
[22:54:36] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: are you really making bets on how much I cause trouble</span><br />
[22:54:43] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: this is why I hate people</span><br />
[22:55:00] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: No, It was the meteor in general.</span><br />
[22:55:08] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Did anyone else die?</span><br />
[22:55:40] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: no.</span><br />
[22:55:47] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: We have a new person though</span><br />
[22:55:50] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: she seems nice</span><br />
[22:56:00] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: I think I knew her before</span><br />
[22:56:59] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well, you don't need to hear me screaming about my present flight.</span><br />
[22:57:21] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: what</span><br />
[22:57:32] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: You don't want to know.</span><br />
[22:57:51] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: but seriously back to the matter at hand, I need my own room...or to move away from the meme-loving fuck</span><br />
[22:57:53] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Anyway, we found more resources... I'll photocopy them when I get back.</span><br />
[22:58:42] <span style="color:#009900">CPK: Is anyone even using the basement</span><br />
[22:58:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I have the cork board there.</span><br />
[22:59:08] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: can I have a tiny room there</span><br />
[22:59:09] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And SC has his furniture.</span><br />
[22:59:14] <span style="color:#009900">CPK: If not I'm going to carve bedrooms down there and move the beds down to make more room in hideout propper</span><br />
[22:59:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Sure, we can make a cubby I guess.</span><br />
[22:59:31] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: Yeeeesssss</span><br />
[22:59:38] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ...we need proper locks though</span><br />
[22:59:51] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: so that meme-loving fuck doesn't fuck up my room</span><br />
[23:00:11] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Locks don't do shit when most people can teleport through doors and shit.</span><br />
[23:00:37] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: then we need to develop things to prevent that.</span><br />
[23:01:18] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: last thing I need is my room be covered in puke green fuckheads</span><br />
[23:02:39] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: I don't mind grinding for grist forever for that kind of safety</span><br />
