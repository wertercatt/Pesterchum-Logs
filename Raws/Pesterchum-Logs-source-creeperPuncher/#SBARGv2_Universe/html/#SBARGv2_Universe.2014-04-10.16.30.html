[05:19] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: If needed, it will be able to make defenses for gene, and can send items through the door incase of us running out of everything.</span><br />
[05:20] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Well, maybe not.</span><br />
[05:20] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I know that a consort can go through the door (not a fun thing to see in space nope nope nope)</span><br />
