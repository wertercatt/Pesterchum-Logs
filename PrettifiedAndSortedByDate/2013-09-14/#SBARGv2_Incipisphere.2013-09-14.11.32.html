[11:32:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........?</span><br />
[11:32:56] SB: wouldnt it be the opposite <span style="color:#00ff00">of phantom limbs?</span><br />
[11:33:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well yeah</span><br />
[11:33:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except its wired all differently</span><br />
[11:33:36] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  from the change<span style="color:#730e8f"> back very likely no</span></span><br />
[11:33:43] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  assuming that<span style="color:#730e8f"> had happened</span></span><br />
[11:34:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: said person would need to learn to wall /all over again/</span><br />
[11:34:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: walk*</span><br />
[11:34:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright</span><br />
[11:34:36] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: o-kay... </span><br />
[11:34:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: imagine if the sensory input for your arms and legs was swapped?</span><br />
[11:35:05] SB: Well they <span style="color:#00ff00">did it as</span> and infant<br />
[11:35:31] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  *enter<span style="color:#730e8f"> sebulba*</span></span><br />
[11:36:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but thats just the issue of controlling the new body</span><br />
[11:36:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what about adjusting to the new diet?</span><br />
[11:36:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about now having the brain of a spider?</span><br />
[11:37:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CSB</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[11:39:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hey, these are serious questions people!</span><br />
[11:40:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, simply put: One would have quite a time changing  species suddenly... new limbs, new bodilly systems, new diets, new dangers...</span><br />
[11:40:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[11:40:53] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ... /)</span><br />
[11:40:58] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Welcome to myy world /)</span><br />
[11:41:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh.</span><br />
[11:42:01] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, you have to deal with just the wings of a bird. You are still mostly mammalian, so theres that.</span><br />
[11:42:22] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: CP I don't really have an explanation for.</span><br />
[11:42:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, the dog part knew how to walk</span><br />
[11:42:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so thats how I explain sprites</span><br />
[11:43:19] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yeah, but it would have been an entirely new skeletal system... eh shrug.</span><br />
[11:44:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: imprinting on an already existing creature is easy...</span><br />
[11:44:05] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: 'Least none of you  have to deal with switching between being a mamal and a reptile, so theres that plus.</span><br />
[11:44:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:44:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Athena, do you know what tempting fate is?</span><br />
[11:44:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Please stop doing that.</span><br />
[11:45:08] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Okay, none of you: Don't switch between being a reptile and a mamal. It's not fun. Don't do it.</span><br />
[11:45:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, if you remember, I was passed out in a kind of system shock for a few days after I prototyped, and Issun had to act as auto-responder...</span><br />
[11:45:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: else we are going to have a newcomer self prototype with a snake</span><br />
[11:45:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:45:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /and I just got that/</span><br />
[11:46:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[11:46:06] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Eh?</span><br />
[11:46:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: denizen logic... nevermind</span><br />
[11:46:35] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Aaah. I see. Anyways.</span><br />
[11:47:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Even bodyswapping a Denizen or animal or w/e.</span><br />
[11:47:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: holy fuuuck where did everything go wrong how move what do</span><br />
[11:48:01] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Basically.</span><br />
[11:48:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[11:48:18] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: what? ♥</span><br />
[11:48:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I had this dream once where someone drank a potion and turned into a snake... then I woke up.</span><br />
[11:49:02] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: In order to switch like that and be able to instantly move, one would have to go through that change multiple times to get used to it. Even then, it cant be fun.</span><br />
[11:49:50] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: ... that makes me wonder about link and all the masks he's used ♥</span><br />
[11:50:21] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: like the first time he turned into a deku sprout ♥</span><br />
[11:50:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all of those were bipedial... and the masks used to be people.</span><br />
[11:50:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: spoilers</span><br />
[11:51:16] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: that's... not what i mean though ♥</span><br />
[11:51:28] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Okay, that would be someone turning from a mamel, to a part-mamel-part-plant thing. Even if the skeletal structure was simmilar...</span><br />
[11:51:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you inprint on an existing creature, that creature still has the memory on how to move</span><br />
[11:52:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like Sprites</span><br />
[11:52:20] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, I suppose so...</span><br />
[12:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its simple to move if your sharing a body... but if its a brand new body with noone else in there... well its gonna be /tough/</span><br />
[12:03:15] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed...</span><br />
[12:10:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: saw that pic about wisdom Athena</span><br />
[12:10:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: intelegence is knowing /how/ to make antimatter</span><br />
[12:10:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wisdom is knowing never to use it.</span><br />
[12:11:00] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Exactly.</span><br />
[12:12:13] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Thats why some people can be intelegent without being very wise... heck, I can list a couple people hoo i've met thus far hoo fit that criterea.</span><br />
[12:12:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...me?</span><br />
[12:12:42] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: *criteria</span><br />
[12:12:46] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Naaah</span><br />
[12:13:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: You say stupid things at times, thats all. You know how to make antimatter, but you know not to use the stuff... right?</span><br />
[12:13:51] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Please tell me you havent used antimatter for the heck of it.</span><br />
[12:14:16] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: i'm willing to guess he has ♥</span><br />
[12:14:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /tiny/ amounts</span><br />
[12:14:28] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: that's still using it ♥</span><br />
[12:14:32] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ...</span><br />
[12:14:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Less than a milligram.</span><br />
[12:14:54] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: /that's still using it/ ♥</span><br />
[12:15:11] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I retract my statement then. You are knowledgeable... but not so wise in many cases...</span><br />
[12:15:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know not to make more than that.</span><br />
[12:15:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, the only time I remember you ACTUALLY using that stuff was in an attempt to close Chronos' black hole attack the other day on LoIaR...</span><br />
[12:16:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, at least I keep it contained.</span><br />
[12:16:30] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: it didn't work, did it? ♥</span><br />
[12:16:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, it didn't</span><br />
[12:16:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I didn't even get to see an explosion.</span><br />
[12:16:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
[12:17:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I'll just watch mythbusters again</span><br />
[12:17:01] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: ... wow ♥</span><br />
[12:17:23] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I second that "... wow"</span><br />
[12:17:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hey, explosions are /cool/</span><br />
[12:17:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cooler then bowties or fezzes.</span><br />
[12:18:13] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, yes, but....</span><br />
[12:19:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: explosions make everything cooler. how /much/ cooler, however, depends on what you exploded and whether or not it was a good idea to.</span><br />
[12:19:20] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Exactly. -And if one is a safe distance away from the explosion or not.</span><br />
[12:19:30] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Explosions rock.</span><br />
[12:19:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can blow things up from the inside out.</span><br />
[12:19:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's fucking brilliant.</span><br />
[12:20:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and when people say that cool people don't look at explosions... well fuck those people.</span><br />
[12:20:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm looking at the explosion anyway.</span><br />
[12:20:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because it's /pretty/.</span><br />
[12:21:25] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I personally love watching things implode as well.</span><br />
[12:22:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, that reminds me of the rainbomb I made that one time... it didn't do much.</span><br />
[12:22:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but it sure was pretty</span><br />
[12:22:38] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: heh, nice.</span><br />
[12:23:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and on implosions and such... seeing underlings telefragged in the early game...</span><br />
[12:23:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
[12:24:18] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: um...  thats kinda... eek.</span><br />
[12:24:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[12:25:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dude. Telefrag underlings by shoving a bomb into their hearts and letting it blow up, scattering their atoms /as they explode/.</span><br />
[12:25:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The grist blender is /much/ less terrifying.</span><br />
[12:25:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[12:25:21] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ...</span><br />
[12:25:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[12:26:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: :D</span><br />
[12:26:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats uh...</span><br />
[12:26:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Make sure your hand's out of the way or it really hurts ;-;</span><br />
[12:26:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: remember it takes a split second for underling corpses to vanish.</span><br />
[12:27:05] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Note to self: Never let  AG get anywhere near any of my explosives.</span><br />
[12:27:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It makes cleaning up really easy. No blood! ^_^</span><br />
[12:27:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh yeah, I have magical T&amp;T now.</span><br />
[12:27:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Along with the firepots I already had :D</span><br />
[12:27:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Note to Self, copy Athenas note to self.</span><br />

[12:29:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's magical.</span><br />

[12:30:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: think of it like that</span><br />
[12:30:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I have lightning and fire cards.</span><br />

[12:31:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait, IJ? huh? Issun's not online, so who /was/ that?</span><br />
[12:31:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Huh...</span><br />
[12:31:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: immaculationJusticor, he connected and immediately left</span><br />
[12:31:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also FL, I think your science conversation in Hotel last night just got us in trouble in here.</span><br />

[12:33:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: the point is I'm starting research into plasma.</span><br />
[12:33:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: and /weaponising/ plasma.</span><br />

[12:37:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: all I got was "I need to really learn how to make a sun".</span><br />
[12:37:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean, aside from my card.</span><br />
[12:37:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[12:37:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, do you have that picture of a rocket shooting over a point?</span><br />
[12:37:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[12:37:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: with a stickfigure riding the rocket?</span><br />

[12:41:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gambit have you even /seen/ my explosives?</span><br />
[12:41:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The antimatter ones?</span><br />
[12:41:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I actually /made/ a few drops of that white oil that was in that one event.</span><br />
[12:42:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What white oil?</span><br />
[12:42:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: remember the white matter oil that when it reacted to oxygen, it actually produced /nuclear fusion/?</span><br />
[12:43:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … no. Which dungeon was that?</span><br />
[12:43:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait, you mentioned that in Hotel yesterday...</span><br />
[12:43:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it was EP's hotel event</span><br />
