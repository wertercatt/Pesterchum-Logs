<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: DP gave you the code to Havel's ring but somehow the code got messed up and did the opposite thing. Then you decided to rol with it and a couple alchemizations later, Ogres started fying into space and I'm retty sure you have a hypergravity training chamber thingie from that set of stuff as well.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm alright, just doubting wether I chose the right thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You barginned, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's a long story</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Word to the wise: Most of the time there's no clear cut "right" or "wrong". Thinking of things that that leads to self doubt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: mm</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're a Time hero but that means you understand more then anyone the locamotion of time. No room for regrets, you just gotta do you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And hope it works out. If it doesn't, you do another thing and /make/ it work out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hehehe, life sorta like...A Metroidvania-type game, what with the countless paths you can take, the only being able to progress certain ways after you've done certain things, the plentiful chances for breaking outta order...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I wonder if it really is like a Metroidvania now that I say it out loud...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Yeah. Yeah its... /probably/ like a Metroidvania</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: "<span style="color:#e00707">just roll with it and see what happens, and above all try not to do anything retarded</span>"</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: applies not just to Weird Time Shit, but life in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Pretty much!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, regualar people travel through time too, just at the same rate of one second per second with no jumps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: unfortunately, the definition of "retarded" is the most subjective thing in the history of paradox space</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: can we do time stuff yet?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure, can we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: been wondering when I'm gonna start tossing back the notes instead of catching them</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I have a couple of things to check up on in the past</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I don't think we officially can use aspect powers yet, but you can probably at least "sense" your aspect already...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I know I'm already feeling more aware of luck, and when it does and doesn't matter...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: has future you said anything about my memory loss and what might be causing it?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I've gotten the last of the notes that I'm going to send to myeslf already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and nothing about my memory loss?\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the only note I have about you is the one that says "get over your shame and help the time player in the memo"</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: but couldn't that mess me up more?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: also what is that suppose to mean?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was an earlier note</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well how are you suppose to help me?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nothing but weird flashes and senses of... Things that happened to me? But I don't remember them...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it doesn't say anything specific</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's the closest I've got to aspect powers and I don't even know how it works like I figure that'd be a Time thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not a Heart thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: future you is no help at all\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, we're supposed to figure stuff out in the present, you know.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: you can? so I am in the wrong building\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, her house is kinda connected to the base?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dot</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dot</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dot</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok then i'll be heading over to sword base.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: alright Now I think i'm in sword base. the big glowing blue panel right?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  well it's near the transportalizer isn't it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: what does the transportalizer look like?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  what, you don't remember the webcomic too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's like a circular thingy on the floor</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, a gray looking disk thing on the floorwith the weird triangl-y pattern and a couple buttons on a control panel thingie</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yes it's near that\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  okay good then you've found it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  almost there too</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and no i remember the webcomic it's just I didn't remember what the transportalizer looked like\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's understandable</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  when I first looked at the map I remember mistaking transportalizers for a strange omnipresent, circular room on all floors occupied by a player with the chumhandle abbreviation of TP</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the transportalizers are voice actived are they?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think they're either button-activated or thought activated</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure which</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: what thought actived tech?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  although I'm sure it has a control panel for a reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: if you that it I want it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i want to add it to my gauntlet\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ask SV about it next time he pops in. He set up a really cool control scheme for the unreal ride.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aka, the space van</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: right space van. also why were people blaming me for causing untold mayham\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: space ogres</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: does it have something to do with the gravity gauntlet?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dot</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dot</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dot</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so I made space ogres?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  also I'm heading up to the building now</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  in a manner of speaking, yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: more like an ogre space program</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so what happens to ogres in space?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  heck if I know</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they float around and get in the way I think???</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  yeah that's it</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so no space explosions from lack of oxygen?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  um...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I was able to fly to other planets with sarahsprite with little problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: do ogres need to bnreath?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the medium doesn't have a lack of oxygen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  hey, CS, what floor are you on right now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well i'm feeling tried.\l/</span><br />
