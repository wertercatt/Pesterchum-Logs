<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...SV, where is everyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh no, the glitch didnt get everyone, did it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...SV?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, LL!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#eacf00">CURRENT lunarLemonade [CLL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ...sup ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess its more than just me who is still here!</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: welp</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I kinda found out why the guardian doesn't want us flying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: My ears are wide open</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There are some lands... that are made of glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Entirely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Land of X*£}@e and ''1?èt/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not exactly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: "WHAT THE FUXX"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, if you touch one... your code is gone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: But as in, corrupted data ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Virus Planets, so to speak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: the corruption</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it is here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: We're down the rabbit hole then I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are a Corrupt Session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Oh my, oh my.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure thats a term that works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Do you think the glitches are contagious ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I know your code can be deleted by them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If its a glitchy patch of air.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: You assume we are code though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey MO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we lost 2 people to the glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On the Land of Doors and Darkness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9c2bff">CURRENT midnightOger [CMO]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: who ¿?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I think I read about them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: (( why don't I see the generel memo in the list? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would think the closest thing in reality... would be quark matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: (( nvm ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Quark. Matter ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Particularly Strange Matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_matter'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_matter</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: but who did we lose to the glitches¿?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, that doesn't really discribe the effect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I have their names on the tip of my tongue</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I caught a glimpse of a conversation about them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: CT and FM¿?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.cracked.com/article_16583_the-5-scientific-experiments-most-likely-to-end-world.html'>http://www.cracked.com/article_16583_the-5-scientific-experiments-most-likely-to-end-world.html</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: CF and VE ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, that sounds right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: MO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry, needed to specifiy who sounded right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah well, may them rest in peace in... whatever afterlife they are in</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: Ya I know they where in my and SV's team remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: none...</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: assuming the afterlife isn't glitched augh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They didn't die, their code was erased.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: as in a scratch ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kinda?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ôô</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Beforus session killed them selves to live on in the afterlife.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But, if your scratched...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its a cessation of existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I always thought the dream bubbles were a sort of purgatory</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: and the real afterlife was after it</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: y'know, the one with Death and board games and tea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured problem slueth just took place in a dream bubble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...have you seen what happens when a bubble self tries to leave the dream bubble?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: perhaps Team Sleuth were prospit agents ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: uh... it disintegrates ? it can't ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its similar to an imaginary self trying to exit through a window.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: skulls yay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and the windows exist here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And now I know how it works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Team Slueth were exiles who were using the windows to hop into the dream bubbles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It makes so much sense I wonder why you even asked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: well with the asspects now active, the dream bubbles might apear more offten as we are bound to have some mind players in our midst</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: my theory up until now is that the Imaginary City was a dream bubble and the Real City was Prospit and they were locked in</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: *was</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: and what we weren't shown... is the city's color</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it's actually prospit /in the past/</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: &lt;_&lt; &gt;_&gt; v_v ok forget anything i said this is stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But they weren't wearing the uniforms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: no prototypes yet ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: or wierd plot shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, there is still coloration... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me check.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: makes me remember about that shitty thing I drew when I was bored and had that theory</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL:  <a href='http://1mage.fr/images/prospitsleubjb.png'>http://1mage.fr/images/prospitsleubjb.png</a> THIS IS STUPID</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, never mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its white uniforms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006802'>http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006802</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: that is why you do /not/ leave me with shitty windows 7 paint and no internet for an hour</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah nice find</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: is there a list of player prototypes ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: *(( ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yes, but I don't recall the link.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It only posts the pre entry ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you want to submit a prototype, here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGFhM19tU2kwcTUtWXllTFB4UUR2SHc6MQ'>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGFhM19tU2kwcTUtWXllTFB4UUR2SHc6MQ</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't find the list, but that form auto updates the list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: nvm I just found it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: link?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: but thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: er I mean that one</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: but without your link</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I just didn't look hard enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you have a link to the list itself?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL:  <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am0rFYqIxavFdGFhM19tU2kwcTUtWXllTFB4UUR2SHc&usp=sharing'>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am0rFYqIxavFdGFhM19tU2kwcTUtWXllTFB4UUR2SHc&usp=sharing</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((that's because I honestly still /have no idea/ what I prototyped))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((although I have thought of a few things))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was the one that prototyped the cruxite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: you</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: wha</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: how</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: why</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I didn't have time to prototype anything else!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I ONLY HAD 16 SECONDS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: and then we complain about glitches :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I barely had time to make my entry item, let alone prototype!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But Cruxitebuddysprite is awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Buddy was one of my dogs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Aw</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You know, it KINDA SUCKS how everyone we knew more than a year ago is now dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: yeah D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it's already been a year ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: oh right, the flow of time i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there apparently was a previous session... that we forgot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I... have this vague idea of seeing a newspaper announcing meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Supposedly I was the lord of blood... weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: but my brain tells me nothing happened that day</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: there was a session ? was it retconned ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And in that one, I prototyped a perfectly generic object.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And more like scratched.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: you have a thing with personalityless prototyping do you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: just imagine, perfectlygenericobjectcruxitesprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: most boring sprite ever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I use pointless first prototypes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((anyway. do you think a goomba plushie (pre-entry) and a 3D globe map of constellations would be interesting ? Goombastronomersprite ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Hey, there is a pattern to prototype stupid things... like hard games. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( SPY IMPS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((oh lol "let's prototype Dark Souls"))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( 29. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( That was the example. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((oh shit really))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Prototype a snake... or something. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I was thinking about something plausible but not mundane))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((nothing out of the ordinary))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Wait, use the sbarg disc! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It was burned to a disc in the ARG... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( SbargV2 disc. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((worst idea ever))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( MINECRAFT. PROTOTYPE IT. ))_</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( CREEPER IMPS. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((please no))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((;_;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((there's already enough games i think))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( You have any pets? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((eh, a dog))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but it's pretty average))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...no fish? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((nah))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((could've been interesting))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Okay, where do you live? Do you have any animals outside that could fly/jump into a sprite? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( SQUIRELSPRITE.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((not that I can think of.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I'm in some village))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...so you live in a city- oh. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((not godforsaken enough to have live animals near))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((not known enough to have anything interesting))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Not even squirrels or birds? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((oh shit I know I'll go with a freaking baguette, say hello to bakersprite))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( AWESOME. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I think we are in agreement))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( wait, make it a baker hat. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( So the sprite can cook. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Instead of being made of bread. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((no baking clothes in sight :[ ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Paper baking hat? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Utencils? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((now isn't that a bit far-fetched))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Use a mixing spoon. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((mh))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I have a blender))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Oh god. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It would be awesome, and deadly. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( DO IT. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but honestly all these things don't sound as much fun as a baguette sprite. throw in a goomba plushie y/n))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((Monsieur Goombasprite))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...what about a cookbook? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((i'm not jane crocker))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It would be more likely that a baguette would make a bread sprite than a baker sprite. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Hey, I have a cookbook in the house! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Actually a few... my mom uses them. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((i do too))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah, I have a breadmaker))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((that'll do</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Perfect.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Heating coils and a goomba that can pop out loaves of bread. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((out of all things why i'd want to throw a breadmaker in a seizure-inducing ball to save my life escapes my mind))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It fell. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((yusss, going with it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( After all, thats how a prototype actually happened in the comic... wait, 2. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Forgot about feferis eldrich terror. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((it's worth all the baguette-under-nonexistant-arm french goombas))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((though it might've been funnier))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I think the majority of imps are cats. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: *((</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but don't you want to fight imps with berets that smash you with baguettes))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((don't you ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( use the bread maker... they will be able to FIRE BREAD AS A PROJECTILE. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((mh.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((tbh if I wanted to be savvy I could've prototyped something innofensive to change the imps into generic things, like a goomba, first, and then something with implied knowledge like a baker))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProjectileToast'>http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProjectileToast</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It needs to happen. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((oh I know, a toaster with grilling baguette inside))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I don't care if it would make the enemys stronger, but WE NEED FLYING TOAST. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SBURB runs on ~ATH, we managed to DDOS it, and there are glitchly masses that will kill you floating in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: glitchy*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, more like cessation of existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you get the idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I don't think it was this bad before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Chances are its mostly the glitch that's causing the worse of it</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I assume we caused.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: By DDOSing Sburb.</span><br />
