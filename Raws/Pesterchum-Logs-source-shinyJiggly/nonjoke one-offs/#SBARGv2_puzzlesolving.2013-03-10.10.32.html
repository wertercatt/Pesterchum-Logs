<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: I've been trying to  solve these codes all day and have gotten nowhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: earlier today you mentioned something about pumpkins, what was it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: I don't remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me scroll up on the gen chat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: the problem lies in that we need some context to if they are being solved correctly. Not to mention 3 out 4 need some sort of keyword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: finally, found it. had to get into the logs folders. </span><br />

<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: that was me trying to help explain Sbarg to that new person.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would you like to solve some puzzles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I've been gathering a group together</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Hasn't the most recent one been solved, though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope, it's a tough one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which link should I grab...</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we're really lacking in manpower here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I thought I saw it solved, already.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I'm no good at ciphers and... shit like that</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I have a friend on my team that seems to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: When he gets on tomorrow I'll show him and see if he can piece it together (He's on my team)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Yeah good luck with those...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: What exactly more do we need to find with these codes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I wasn't here for the first code part</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: do you mean the locations?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I guess?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Although aren't the locations all in America?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Mmm, then I can't help with that part.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Know anyone that can?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Hmmm... well I can ask Pat actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: He's in America and wants to join in</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I'm just not sure whereabouts he is</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Where are the locations of the codes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: He's in, uh... Sacramento, California</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: These are the locations: <a href='http://sbarghqv2.tumblr.com/post/43908320281/while-i-cant-actually-reach-any-of-these-place-i'>http://sbarghqv2.tumblr.com/post/43908320281/while-i-cant-actually-reach-any-of-these-place-i</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: He might be able to get to LA</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Have any of the codes in those locations been found yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Oh bloody hell, okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Nearly all of us are too far away.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: I'll try to rally together some of my American friends and see what they can grab then</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Dang.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: That sucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: yes it does.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Wrong way round.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: No clue if Colorado is near any of the clues... because y'know, aha</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: aw fuck, one was JUST in new york</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ca13b">CCT: Okay, well, all the people I've asked that are online are no dice, I'll try to contact Pat tomorrow &gt;&lt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: noodle, one of your asks got answered</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0000aa">CURRENT Noodles [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">?NC: Looking back was CL just acting stupid and trying to get NN mad or was he seriously not understanding what NN was saying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me check in the logs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Cause it seems to me he wasn't even acknowledging what NN was saying till he starting getting mad at him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I found the part in the logs on that day where CL started talking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's see here... NN was already in Karkat mode before CL started talking, so he was already sort of irritated with puzzle related things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Well from what I saw in PS, CL certainly didn't help the situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: much of it seemed to be NN mirroring PP's apparent frustration.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which makes a bit of sense since they depend on eachother for emotional support.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: I'm frustrated at these too but I guess I'm just more "something".</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#4e0076">CURRENT greekFortune [CGF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4e0076">CGF: <span style="color:#08f268">i'm frustrated because there are no hints</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#4e0076">CGF: <span style="color:#6662ac">and the kind of puzzle it is makes it hard to just wmg</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Thus my ask which gave us nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmm, I'm getting further down the page and it seems that NN was starting to get frustrated with how he had to explain so many things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and then CL made it worse starting here: "CCL: So don;t be a dick NN CCL: I just stated an Idea"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: Why? It really didn't seem that complicated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4e0076">CGF: <span style="color:#aa95f4">what hapend</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: NN's freak out GF</span><br />
<span style="color:#4e0076">CGF: <span style="color:#e4a0f4">did nn flip out again</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#4e0076">CGF: <span style="color:#240dcb">is that why hes not going in the memo</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#4e0076">CGF: <span style="color:#17d6b7">oh</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: no the original flip out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably some other unrelated problem that's causing his current abscence</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, I'm probably wrong, like I always seem to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like that one time NN was depressed and I didn't even catch wind of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that was a while back</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">CNC: I don't remember that...</span><br />
