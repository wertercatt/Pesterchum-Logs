<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: All I can assume about this chart</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: lets stop talking about the fucking chart</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is it takes into account /all/ quadrants which makes it worse but also makes it semi-comprehensible</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but the truth of the matter</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is that a new universe is worth the loss of a single planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#62657f">CTG: Never come back Tony. Stupid has a way of following you, egocentric ass you are.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a675">CFF: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Y'know. The meteors deliver the ectokids. That's why it's such a vital part of Game mechanics, to start the Reckoning, to get Skaia's defence portals open so our ectokids will be spread. The Reckoning is otherwise just like a timer for "you have this long to kill the Black King" or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Charles. /Shut up/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Without ectokids, this Game is just fucked up -.-</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anywho.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: chronos isnt awful at everything all the time like this guy</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a675">CFF: Which one of use, TG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how does beta earth even sustain existence?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I JUST CORRECTED A TYPO</span><br />
<span style="color:#62657f">CTG: First you blame predistination and now you claim it as part of a greater good?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh please</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Would it be better to just not care at all?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean. it would /need/ to have a session occur in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#62657f">CTG: The lives of everyone you killed by making the conscious decision to enter this game, it was worth it so you might create a new universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#62657f">CTG: Anything to reason the need to play this game and live out your fantasy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: otherwise it's easier to say that Beta Earth is a session without the game, thus invalidating it as an existing entity</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but through paradox BS it does.</span><br />
