<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL... maybe we should just say back and watch Gene grow up.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: wheres this coming from</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the fact that... most of us would make horrible gods.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but you have crux, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: from what ive seen you did a decent job with him</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...did i miss something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, Crux worries about and cares for you, so I'd say you're doing a good job raising him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cancer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh no... is it because he's an ectomutant?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, I think it was that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or maybe it was me messing with what I shouldn't.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((its not set in stone so ill leave it up to you: could sl's maid of life powers remove the cancer? he might actually be able to specifically target and kill the cancer cells))</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((then let me bring it to ic))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i might be able to remove cancer</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ive never tried but</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its worth a shot at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well it would have been nice to know that yesterday.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...im so sorry</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't be, you had given me extra time with him, and we didn't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wish i knew what to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: did you not know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and I guess the Feeling Fine badge I gave him didn't affect cancer either :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I... only knew after he had problems standing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i just dont know what to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i know how empty words feel at this point</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just wish it was a monster.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would have been easier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I would have had something to blame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...when did it happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what about trying to pull a Chrono Trigger or something? swap Past Crux with a clone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...or do you not want to risk causing a doomed timeline?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't think you can just do that, especially for a situation like this... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:(</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like he said, there isnt a monster on this one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if only we had known sooner...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i could have done something</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe its paradox spaces way of punishing me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: punishing you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nah</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: youve definitely fucked up but nothing enough for this level of karmic retribution</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I couldn't see Paradox Space doing something /this/ bad. not even to motherbarking Caliborn if he had a pet (Gamzee probably doesn't count).</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i wonder...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what did crux and amy have in common</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: besides being the loved ones of players</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: they were both game constructs, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, how did you get Crux anyway? I think you said you were trying to ectoclone CruxiteBuddysprite?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I wasn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, maybe I was</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it was my dreamself</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe... maybe paradox space is making sure only players go through the door</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, if thats the case, then it can burn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I agree with FL. if that's what's going on, Paradox Space can shove its metaphysical head up its ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but what could we even do to stop it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if paradox space decided to dick us all over... were at its mercy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...but speculation isnt going to do anybody any good</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...no, getting LE involved is too far.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: waitwhat? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fl, i admit i never got to know crux too well, but i know what its like to lose someone</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if you ever need somebody to talk to, just let me know</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((in the meantime i need to go grab dinner))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (SJ, I was trying to think of ways to actually get back at P-Space, and that was the only thing I could come up with)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah FL, I'm here for you too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I was going to go the opposite of LE tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: According to Calliope, universes are supposed to eventually die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we are going to make ours immortal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........ :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know how... but... I want to do it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure that's even possible? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: part of me is screaming "FL is high again", but the other part is screaming "let's at least try it, for Crux's sake".</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and I'm listening to the latter, this time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets just do something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what are you planning, Charles? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: figuring out how to deal with Mr. Achern Ptolem in hotel</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you're just gonna leave the "immortal froggiverse" plan to simmer, and focus on something else? mmk...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aw, you're not gonna call him Jugemu? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ i am not calling him Jugemu</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and well, I would need to do more research about giving it immortality.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...the other thing I'm saying is, me, Ash, and anyone else with pets really oughta keep a close eye on them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For all we know, it might take an awakened god tier Page of Life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Kutone and Ruari still have their Lifey Thing option available, and the former has the same "prevent death as much as barking possible" badge set I do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...SL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am sorry about suggesting the Chrono Trigger concept.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean suggesting it for Amy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm expecially sorry for saying you didn't care...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((just curious, when you decided to do this plot thing, did you remember that I had given him those badges, and factored it in (as in Feeling Fine really wouldn't have done anything about the cancer), or not?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( No, I didn't remember about the badges. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh... okay, just wondering... sigh.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Cancer just made the most sense. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I guess game logic only goes so far, and real life stuff sometimes overrules it.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, it could be considered a punishment for FL's munchkinry. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and speaking of real-life biology laws, I'm mostly done writing that thing SL demanded of me... or rather, the thing I originally said I was going to write, not what he thought I said about it.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((*shrug*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Sburb's kind of a game you /have/ to munchkin to survive in, though.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((dunno, not all the time.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Not to the level FL was. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Seriously, retailiation was coming as soon as he started weaponizing. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Too bad I have to play both the munchkin and the GM that punishes him. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Of course, FL's answer is "MORE MUNCHKINRY"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Which /would/ be my response in reality as well. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sigh. I kinda know what you mean. for a large chunk of the game I was playing CP as, as NV put it, "okami wish fulfillment thingy". and it took me until he said that to realize it. which is why I've been playing him a bit differently lately...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also tbh, if I was in a real session, I probably would at least climb the lower rungs of the Munchkin Tiers at some point.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( but not to the point of antimatter? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((hell no))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Personally, I like my reality based munchkinry. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that is Too Far by every definition... except if 682 got involved. I probably would be that desperate then.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Its much better than a portable hole sandwich. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I don't really consider CP to be a self-insert anymore, but aside from the lupine tendancies, he and I do still have basically the same personality.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( of course with all the RPing we have done here, I would likely start out my alchemy with getting a recipe modus... and doing code subtraction to get high tier shit. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( If we ever had a reallife session ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and I probably would beeline for the SAO Modus as well, it's just so cool :D))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Recipe and File System combo. SO COOL. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((id probably be too afraid and lazy to leave the house or do any climbing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I've heard people say that Homestuck is basically a let's-play-style strategy guide for Sburb, but I don't really see it being that way. RPing a session like this is probably way more helpful for something like that.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...guys, what happens if Chronos time warps from a period he was alive to now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Dr. Wily in Megaman II</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I've never played an of the megamans. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aside from suckering himself into a textbook "Time Can Be Rewritten, But Not Once You've Read It", shrug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *any ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I haven't megamanned either (unless Stinkoman 20X6 counts, being a spoof of the gameplay style)...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He might decide to go further back and become doomed so... wait, that would doom us too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: form personal time travel experience, I can say that going to the future isn't all that great most of the time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *from ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably sometime when I get bored, though, I plan to download the "AVGN vs Dr Wily" MM2 hack...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dammit I hate time travel</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also on that topic, do you guys think we'll still be able to access Beta Earth's internet from the new universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Likely so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, didn't the trolls have access to youtube or something? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but they were in the medium</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've managed to captcharoid a horror terror server.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not just beta earth internet we can access, you know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just our computers are most compatable with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: right. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, theoretically we could access anything given the right address and software.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course my first stop on alien internet has to be troll 4chan</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hoo boy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: XD ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course I didn't realize that until I was knee deep in alien dicks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfffft ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then my second site was a Cherub porn site... of course, it wasn't that bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just alot of hugging.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: haha</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, CP!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: think we could try SRB2 again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You can turn Master Server off and we can connect directly to IP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um... gimme a bit to boot the thing up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: woo!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, direct-IP's probably a better option. weirdo anon joiners &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, how old were they? 13? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats the SRB2 community for you... the large amount of young noobs, and then the modders.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also, I need to have dinner first. FL, SJ you guys still gonna be on for at least a few more hours? dinner should probably only be about 15min-ish.))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( true, but thats usually for smaller wads. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I would recommend putting rosy.wad into your folders. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((how big is it unzipped? 119.2kb is pretty small...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((says 370 KB here.))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((so, there isn't one?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And, by me saying that... yeah. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((you have to launch the game from the command prompt with the -w flag, but it forces the window to a fucking microscoping 320x200 and you can't make it bigger in any way))</span><br />
