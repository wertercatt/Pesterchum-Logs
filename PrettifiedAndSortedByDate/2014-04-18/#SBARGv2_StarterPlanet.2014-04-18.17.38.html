[17:38:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0078f0">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 STARTERPLANET.</span><br />
[17:39:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  lands on his mountain... and double facepalms. --</span><br />
[17:39:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#438d15">CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[17:39:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  wait what --</span><br />
[17:39:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  i didn't see the first part --</span><br />
[17:39:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  was flying to his mountain in the other memo --</span><br />
[17:40:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // when he took off --</span><br />
[17:40:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  calmly walks outside, using a golden walking stick, holding it by a green orb on the end. --</span><br />
[17:44:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  approaches the base of the mountain. Is it, in reality, a dormant volcano? He decides to feel around for an energy signature to check. --</span><br />
[17:44:17] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (dammit... why do I have to piss him off? Why have I mentally decided to just say screw it to friendship, and go straight to enemies... I just... don't get what I'm doing anymore.)</span><br />
[17:44:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // The lava is deep down, however, there seem to be paths for it to go away from reaching the top... --</span><br />
[17:48:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  slams the rod down through some of the outlying rocky ground. He has all he needs. --</span><br />
[17:48:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  just continues to sit on the mountain, unaware of what is going on. --</span><br />
[17:49:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The ground rumbles violently. --</span><br />
[17:49:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  floats up slightly, wondering what the eff is going on. --</span><br />
[17:51:11] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The lava in the ground coalesces into a single stream, rocketing through (and presumably starting to flood) Charles' mountain base. The energy being fed through the dormant volcano suddenly causes it to spurt out the top, ash everywhere. --</span><br />
[17:51:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  mutters something quietly. --</span><br />
[17:52:02] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  looks at the stream... and spots green!CP with the staff. --</span><br />
[17:52:04] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Shark.</span><br />
[17:52:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  looks back at the stream. --</span><br />
[17:52:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  rips his walking stick out of the rocky ground, walking casually back to the bar, not caring for the destruction he's causing. --</span><br />
[17:53:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  pauses a little way away from the volcano, turning back and looking up. --</span><br />
[17:53:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  points menacingly at Charles, making a throat-slitting motion. --</span><br />
[17:53:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  flies up into the air... and shoots down torwards the base of the mountain. --</span><br />
[17:54:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  Towards where Greenfield is? --</span><br />
[17:54:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  starts slashing through the rock... attempting to... cut the mountain off of the ground? --</span><br />
[17:54:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[17:54:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals into the village having come through the door from Augataur, what the /fuck/ is going on? --</span><br />
[17:55:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  starts zipping around the mountain, cutting faster and faster. --</span><br />
[17:55:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  Unbreathable, practically toxic ash is in the surrounding area's air. --</span><br />
[17:56:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  seems pretty unfazed, despite his surroundings. --</span><br />
[17:56:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  equips fishbowl helmet and flies in the direction of the shenans --</span><br />
[17:56:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is ignited ablaze from the heat around him as well as the fires of his own soul. --</span><br />
[17:56:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  that's a thing, apparently? --</span><br />
[17:57:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  takes a deep breath, sighing. --</span><br />
[17:57:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  screams in mental, physical, and emotional pain. --</span><br />
[17:57:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also, I missed everything before "-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer [CCP] slams the rod down through some of the outlying rocky ground. He has all he needs. --" because I was playing newleaf and missed the memo (literally), what context am I missing?))</span><br />
[17:57:34] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Damage'll at least last for a few years.</span><br />
[17:58:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[17:58:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  pulls out another sword, accelerating even further --</span><br />
[17:58:35] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: (( <a href='http://pastebin.com/icdi2geY'>http://pastebin.com/icdi2geY</a> ))</span><br />
[17:59:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((k))</span><br />
[17:59:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  sits down, casually meditating in midst of the chaos, the rod perched on his knees. He really could care less, couldn't he? --</span><br />
[17:59:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  flies away from the mountain, and slams himself into the side of it. --</span><br />
[17:59:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is attempting to... /push/ the mountain. --</span><br />
[18:01:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  switches his item loadout from the speed base that he was using to something with a bit more power. --</span><br />
[18:01:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  spots FL and flies down --</span><br />
[18:02:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: need some help?</span><br />
[18:02:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // The mountain is beginning to move... and FL's stats are dropping, except for his mangrit, which is increasing. --</span><br />
[18:03:08] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: GET A SPACE PLAYER!</span><br />
[18:03:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Copland transforms into a rocket-powered boxing glove kinda thing, and he starts pushing the mountain with it --</span><br />
[18:03:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there haven't been any around here in weeks!</span><br />
[18:03:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  mutters something in his trance. --</span><br />
[18:03:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is pushing in the same direction FL is, obviously --</span><br />
[18:03:57] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Stupid kids and their flashy, useless powers. . .</span><br />
[18:04:49] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...Kimura, run.</span><br />
[18:04:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dammit, why couldn't Adeelah have been an Earthbender? I /really/ could've used that about n-- what?</span><br />
[18:05:00] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And if I saved him... take care of Crux.</span><br />
[18:05:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is building up energy. --</span><br />
[18:05:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh frogs.</span><br />
[18:05:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  deploys a LakituCam, attaches the Medigun to it pointed at FL in full-blast Ubercharge mode, and flies out of there himself --</span><br />
[18:06:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //your choice as to which type of uber, invuln or crits --</span><br />
[18:07:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  plows into the mountain, shoving it the rest of the way... before it slows to a stop, far from where the lava was pouring out. --</span><br />
[18:07:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  ... Good job, numbnuts. There's still lava pouring out of the ground where the volcano was. --</span><br />
[18:08:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is tumbling down the side of the mountain. --</span><br />
[18:08:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  It coalesces, turning, churning, pumping out at an increasingly fast rate. --</span><br />
[18:09:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  flies back, floating a short distance from the lava --</span><br />
[18:09:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I take back what I said earlier, Firebending probably /is/ what's needed right now.</span><br />
[18:09:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  comes to a stop on a flattened tree... alive. --</span><br />
[18:10:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shifts to human form because the motions kinda require hands, and starts trying to bend the lava away from the village... not even redirect in a specific way, just "you no go toward village" --</span><br />
[18:12:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The lava's presently collecting into some sort of spherical shape, above the ground-- but something seems to tug back at Kimura's attempts. --</span><br />
[18:13:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  supplements the bending with some brush use --</span><br />
[18:15:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  It's absolutely clear now, that someone with a serious amount of discipline and experience is actively working against Kimura. --</span><br />
[18:15:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what the fuck is going on here?</span><br />
[18:16:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  is still seen calmly meditating amongst the ashy air. --</span><br />
[18:17:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  goes "fuck magic" and has Copland put up a forcefield between the lava and the village... but still keeps trying the magic thing anyway --</span><br />
[18:18:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((afk gotta check the mail))</span><br />
[18:20:02] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is too tired to wiggle his left foot, let alone do anything to help the situation --</span><br />
[18:22:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((back))</span><br />
[18:24:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  ((supposes he's going to have to borrow art for this)) --</span><br />
[18:24:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  keeps doing the thing, while the lakitucam keeps focusing the medigun on FL --</span><br />

[18:27:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  is certainly doing something with this mass of magma, isn't he? <a href='http://music.jwmusic.org/track/pour-some-lava-on-me'>http://music.jwmusic.org/track/pour-some-lava-on-me</a> --</span><br />

[18:31:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The gathered sphere of lava slowly rises into the air. --</span><br />
[18:32:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is beginning to strain holding the lava back, even with the forcefield doing most of the work --</span><br />
[18:33:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  wait so it's just kind of surrounding it? --</span><br />
[18:33:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT hopstheFrog [CHF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[18:33:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT hopstheFrog <span style="color:#000000">[CHF]</span>  hops along, a seemingly ordinary frog --</span><br />
[18:33:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  i thought there was like a wall between the area and the village --</span><br />
[18:34:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  it's kind of a curved wall thing, sort of /half/-enclosing it on the village side --</span><br />
[18:35:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  well, i mean, it's more like 4 feet in diameter, at best, so --</span><br />
[18:35:35] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( could you speed this up? I gotta go ))</span><br />
[18:35:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ...oh. okay, I was /way/ overestimating the lava blob then --</span><br />
[18:35:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  in that case, the forcefield extends around the entire lava blob :P --</span><br />
[18:36:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  quietly muses to himself. --</span><br />
[18:37:35] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: It's not the amount you have, really, it's the force and drive you channel through it, that allow it to become powerful.</span><br />

[18:38:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The lava seems to flare out, in a gaseous sense of the word, straining, and possibly disabling-- maybe even outright engulfing the forcefield. --</span><br />
[18:39:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unless the lava can noclip, not happening. the field is airtight --</span><br />

[18:42:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  realizes this isn't gonna work forever, and draws a brushportal to orbit to drop the lava into --</span><br />
