<span style="color:#830000">CNK: still weak pokenak</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it shot a freaking aura sphere right through FL's dog! ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what do you mean by transform twice? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it can probably untransform and then pick another thing to transform into. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: well, shiτ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup :/</span><br />

<span style="color:#830000">CNK: no mew in Fire Red</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no idea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing FL did the nugget bridge trick in Red or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: either that, or it was just hiding until the doorway opened for its escape. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: fix thing play games on thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think that room was pretty wrecked last time we visited it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: alchenak fix it fenax hammer</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: let's... not.</span><br />

<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nakceus</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I doubt that would come out of the original pokemon red, unless someone hacked that into the emulated version. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: Fire red lame play dianak &amp;pearl</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the computer in that room was pretty much a toaster. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, I wonder if that would work though... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: considering what Ornis said about the origins of the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though there's probably a chance that it wouldn't work though. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, he said only those with Chronos' code could close it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: theif rouge heart????</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm thinking it might have something to do with the fact that I turned 21 and because he's a highschool mascot that was used as a flag to activate the "I'm leaving" event. ➜</span><br />
