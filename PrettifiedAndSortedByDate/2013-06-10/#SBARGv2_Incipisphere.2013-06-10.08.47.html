<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets crash a warp capable space craft into him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I dont think warp drive works here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm simply saying that Kinetic Weapons are cooler.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: the area is just to small to warent warp traval.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you wanna branch sessions/</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that and I am scared to activate my shuttles warp drive becuas I dont want to die</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, considering the session diameter is... wait, how big are lands again? ok, let's say an upper bound of Earth-to-the-Moon distance from one edge of the Veil to the other (just over one light-second)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (it's probably way less, but for math reasons let's say it's a light-second)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The diameter of a land is about that of a large city.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: your missing the point its dangerus to use warp drive in a star system</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, that too</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: you mite slam in to a planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus a warp drive isn't even accelration.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: its warping space</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: interesting idea, though. what happens if you warp-drive in the Furthest Ring, with no actual spacetime?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well its not space time as far as miving space around you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you consider the trolls a warhammer 40k clone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: if the ring has no space time then how can you travle through it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not that it has no space time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: NO FL we are not dealing with the warp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its that it doesn't operate normally out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I don't think it /doesn't/ have space time, its just that the rules for those things out there are completely different</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, like that one Enterprise episode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: plus we dont have an emperror to guide us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *ok, it doesn't have MATHEMATICALLY COMPREHENSIBLE spacetime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Wich enterprise episode? Cold front?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Episode 2 of Season 3.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I heard there are some areas out there where Pi doesn't equal 3.14ish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I just hope our lounch dosent suddenly deside to stick to the seling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and e=mc^3?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And differences in the speed of light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that time lord math.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically Non euclidean geometry</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (oh frogs, you're making me want to alchemize a space-capable kart now just because)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((kart?))</span><br />
