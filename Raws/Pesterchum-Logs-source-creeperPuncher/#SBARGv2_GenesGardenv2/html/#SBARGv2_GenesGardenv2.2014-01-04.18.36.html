<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  lies back in the chair and stares at ceiling --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I should crawl into a hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  walks in, seemingly lost in his ACNL game --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  waves to CP. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But seriously: why'd you say that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  waves half heartedly to CP. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Just dont check the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  then promptly checks the memo and rolls her eyes. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh, so what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I'm awful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: What you need is just like a animal-companion to give a hug, if people are being annoying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Animals are quite huggable. Just look at CP!</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: People arent being annoying, I am</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  smirks at EQ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But seriously: The only thing you can really do right now is just ask for hugs when you want them, and respect when people say no or are too busy. Not much else of a solution, besides getting a plushie or pet to hug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway yeah, if you need someone to hug, I could obviously help with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I don't need someone to hug</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I thought TT would like a hug</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Nah. You need hugs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It's clear that you need hugs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I dont need hugs. pah</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh-huh. Suuuure. Keep convincing yourself that you don't need hugs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I like hugs. But I dont need them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Everyone needs hugs every once in a while! Besides, hugs can never hurt! For instance...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: For instance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  hops out of her seat, and heads over to quickly hug IB --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: O-h.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Hi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  releases from the hug. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also comes over to hug --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Now, that wasn't needed. But did that hurt at all? Naah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hugs can never hurt- ... well, unless they are from gambit and secretly are shanks but uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Most people here are not gambit-tier so don't worry!</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I wasnt worried though...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't think anyone's seen Gambit for a while...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm just trying to prove my point. Hugs (almost) never hurt-</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I have messaged gambit from time-to-time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Why was Hugs hurting a topic...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: She's uh... well, being gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  thinks about the conversation so far --</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no idea.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... tch. Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  uncaptchas a large blanket, and carefully spreads it above IB. She doesnt wanna wake anyone up via blankets, after all. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  quietly sleeps, glasses still on his face --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  quietly and carefully picks up the glasses off his face, placing them on a near-by table. She herself has mad many cases of sleeping with glasses on, only for them to be broken in the morning... not fun. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //has never had that problem fortunately... --</span><br />
