<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, Stargates carry a ton of risk.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is also the issue of a gate being destroyed while an object is in transit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so we shouldnt fucking do it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you should, it was a really good show that ran for ten seasons and had a good spin-off (and a not-so-good one)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: on my to-do list</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, it had 3 spin offs.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...three?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, one /half/ sucked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Atlantis, Universe, and Infinity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...never heard of Stargate Infinity...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was a cartoon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, the problem with a gate being destroyed while something was in transit was /specifically/ because the recieving gate didn't have a DHD to maintain its side of the wormhole.</span><br />
