<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and TT you have a new nabor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((land and dungeon events are fun, I can really get into them. but "oh noooooooo planetary destruction", I just... can't. I've lost the ability to can in that case.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((I am  not here IC))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((edit and TT has a new nabor</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And if you say it did, I'm going to specifically say FL never did the healing gel thing, which would mean that THE LAND WOULD HAVE CRASHED. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( So think carefully about your next words. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((what why??)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Just... scroll up. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( Unonymous major retcon ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((fine DX If I cant do things like that WITH MY OWN LAND then what can I do?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ))\</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((SHESH))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, if you involve CRASHING INTO SKAIA, its not just your land anymore. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I think the problem is, a Land being destroyed is NOT "local" to that land. especially crashing into Skaia.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( We're playing characters here. Not lands ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( Major session control goes to the player of chronos and the guardian ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((...anyone wanna play Godfield?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((because i need a freakin' break))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((but it woulkdent have destroyed skaia!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Plus, if a land exploded, the shrapnel would spread to other lands. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, It still would have a GIANT FUCKING CRATER.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((nah. idk how to play, and I'm so far behind on Latura coding you don't even know.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((FINE!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CDS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Oh wow. ))</span><br />
DL: (( Um. ))<br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( It doesn't go like this usually ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well. fuck.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( Sorry for the huge drama. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Trust SV, he knows what he's talking about. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oi...Still need to do an error log, not that anyone cares but</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And 'sides that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...what were we doing again? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm gonna go dungeon diving Saturday or Friday</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT infernalPendulum [CIP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
IP: (( ... Futurama? ))<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Before the timeline branch- Ah, yes. ))</span><br />
DL: So everyone's Lands have been having odd glitches, RS?<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Dungeon being relative since as a giant ruin the lines between "overworld" and "dungeon" are pretty damn blurred.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so, THAT counted as a doomed timeline then?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For me its been weirdness in land generation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It appears that there is something under the surface of my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Pretty sure I shouldn't be having two, maybe three completely different biomes in one land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, what I thought was the natural surface and all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I did a little measurement from orbit, really basic stuff, but I think it might actually be bigger then normal lands?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll just put a IPS waypoint here and go back later?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure since we aren't on Earth anymore, Global doesn't really work for the GPS equivelent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I'm calling it the IPS, short for Incipisphere Positioning System.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Brilliant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I've been mapping out planets slowly but surely by tracking positions through Pester.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The map's more then serviceble for navigation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mind you, I'm using a 64 bit system for this. 16 Bits each for the Altitude, Longitude, And Latitude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the remaining 16 bits determines the Land your on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if your using zero for that, It gives you the X, Y, and Z of your position in SPACE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With Skaia being the center.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm. sounds interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and probably more precise than "just a bunch of circles on a scroll with names next to them" :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I figure I'll release the ^cake files soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It figure I'll have to, as most of the code is GPL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure I'll have to learn DIS* sometime or another though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Going with that ^CAKE is something like python, and DIS* is Like C++ ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and ~ath is a Java-like language, at least the way I've been making shit up))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Actually, I figured its more like HCF managed to become a programming language of its own. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( HALT and CATCH FIRE, for those who don't get it. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Anyway, later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
