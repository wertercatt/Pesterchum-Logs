[06:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 we're blocked to our own timedate mostly :3</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lavenderSiren <span style="color:#dab1ee">[CLS]</span>  //depends on the users native timeframe --</span><br />
[06:19] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( so 1.5 timedate is currently? Sorry i forgot what it is )))</span><br />
[06:20] <span style="color:#dab1ee">CLS: ((so if FL is looking up a thing, he'll only find things up to his current date, but this can be exploited by having someone from the future look things up for them and show it to them))</span><br />

[06:20] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( yeah that's good ))</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( Well, FLord was in the bubble for quite some time before he found the watch, so his timeframe would match Kimura's. ))</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#dab1ee">CLS: ((ah, okay))</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( And the last homestuck update was in 2013. ))</span><br />
[06:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Yeah, the high amount of rust on this watch implies it is over a hundred years old.</span><br />
[06:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...So, I'm guessing timestamp rollover might be a thing.</span><br />
[06:24] <span style="color:#dab1ee">CLS: huh, weird.</span><br />
[06:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
