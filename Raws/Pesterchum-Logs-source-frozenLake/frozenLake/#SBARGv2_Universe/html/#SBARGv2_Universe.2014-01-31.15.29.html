[06:01:53] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Out of 0.38% there are 0.09% that are deserts/wastes</span><br />
[06:02:14] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Most are more jungle or more vegitated landscapes</span><br />

[06:07:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, let me specify some more.</span><br />
[06:10:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What percentage of life supporting planets have step pyramids with a staircase leading to an entrance with a giant frog statue ontop?</span><br />

[06:17:52] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...</span><br />
[06:19:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Inside of the temple should be a giant flower with a timer on the pedestal it rests on.</span><br />
[06:20:19] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...Really now...</span><br />
[06:24:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I highly recommend that the information inscribed on those walls does not make it off that planet... but It has likely gotten off it already.</span><br />
[06:24:42] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...</span><br />
[06:24:55] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: My sister has already transcribed all that was in that temple.</span><br />

[06:28:04] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: My company was getting pretty curious over that temple.</span><br />
[06:28:28] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: But now that I have confirmed that there are players and a game actually exsisting...</span><br />
[06:28:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...right now I'm really hoping the Game only runs on the planet the code was taken from...</span><br />
[06:30:32] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: I suppose I don't really have any more reason to be here besides my original mission.</span><br />
