<span style="color:#161616">CWD: How is everyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Tired, yet fine, myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: I've grown worried about everyone lately...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: &gt;n&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: It must be pretty late, nobody is talking :C</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed.... It seems like most people are asleep. Oh well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. about halfway through watching the log... "Bring Your Denizen To Work Day" indeed O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: I always seem to come in whenever there's a fight or when people aren't active :C</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: hmph</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: That makes me sad :C</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: Maybe I should come here more often, so I get to talk to more people when they're not arguing or sleeping!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: That might be a good idea, indeed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: sometimes I wonder if we ever do anything else here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: That is a very good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, you actually give this memo some more credit: Sometimes you do have interesting conversations that don't end in arguments.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: (*you can actually. cannot type today, nope.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: I liked the days before all the chaos happened. They were at least a bit more peaceful...and fun!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hmph. I myself wonder where exactly the whole chaos started from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: techically I'm stuck in those days right now... though I can't talk to anyone native to my current timeframe. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: *native to the current timeframe I'm in ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: *freaking timey shenanigans ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ah well... Was it really that nice back then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: well, it kinda sucked,especially since this is pre-2nd gate. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: that doesn't get set up for a couple days yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ah, right. Travel must have been... annoying, to say the least huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: back at the time I'm at, "kamigami" is still in control, and it was pretty much implied that using flying things to travel between lands was off-limits for some dumb probably bogus reason. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: The bogus reason was just to make life a little tougher on you players, clearly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I do think it was retroactively funny though that he nerfed /his own past self/ by deleting Seth's rocketscythe though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yeaaaah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CAE: An additional dose of hardship to the boy's life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CAE: If he felt harried and picked on from all sides...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: it's a proven fact that different temporal versions of the same person tend to be harsher on eachother, because tghey know how for approximately they can push things on themself. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: *far ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh... so you think he was trying to actually trigger his past-anger to complete a stable loop or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hm... that might make a bit of sense, yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I can also imagine that diffrent temporal selves are hard on one another for the same reason teachers can be tough with students: Because theres an expectation they hold them to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Hm hm-</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: Time can be a cruel thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: -It can also be a kind thing, mind you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: but it's always a thing regardless ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: It's both, really. Cruel and Kind. ~</span><br />
