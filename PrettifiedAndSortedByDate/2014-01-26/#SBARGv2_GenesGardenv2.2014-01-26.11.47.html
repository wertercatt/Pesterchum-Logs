[01:45:26] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And i was all spooky and invisible on account of being some sort of weird ghost.</span><br />
[01:45:39] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So i followed her a while and i guess i fooled myself into believing this could go well.</span><br />
[01:45:54] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Like being dead was a normal thing a kid does growing up.</span><br />
[01:46:10] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But it didn't work and toni sort of got killed too.</span><br />
[01:46:13] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But she had a dreamself.</span><br />
[01:46:29] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I don't really want to go into what happened to her after that.</span><br />
[01:46:43] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But i spent a long time travelling the session and trying to see what was happening.</span><br />
[01:46:46] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fair enough.</span><br />
[01:46:57] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So i recognise a few of you!</span><br />
[01:47:00] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: A lot of you actually.</span><br />
[01:47:08] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I tried learning to actually make things move.</span><br />
[01:47:12] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Like a poltergeist!</span><br />
[01:47:15] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And it was awesome i did it!</span><br />
[01:47:24] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And it was great, but i kind of just made a mess.</span><br />
[01:47:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <span style="color:#8fbc8f"> don't mind me</span> ))</span><br />
[01:47:52] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So my best bro manages to kill his girlfriend and she becomes a god.</span><br />

[01:48:01] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And she didn't want to bring me back because she's a heartless cow.</span><br />
[01:48:14] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But he manipulated her with amazing ability of being smarter than the idiot.</span><br />
[01:48:14] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh, charming.</span><br />

[01:48:25] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And then poof i was back!</span><br />
[01:48:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Did you even hear what I said? ))</span><br />
[01:48:34] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: (( No. ))</span><br />
[01:48:51] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: We managed to finish our quests, kind of.</span><br />
[01:49:09] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And then it seems the session had finished and there was a door. The three of us went through.</span><br />
[01:49:13] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And...well now i'm here!</span><br />

[01:51:27] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Yeah, we kind of live together.</span><br />
[01:51:29] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: It's chaos.</span><br />
[01:51:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <span style="color:#8fbc8f">Test 2, ignore this.</span> ))</span><br />
[01:52:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... I see.</span><br />
[01:52:46] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So, i guess everyone went god tier but me..</span><br />
[01:53:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob didn't.</span><br />
[01:53:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[01:56:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, its nice hearing your story! I'd ask exactly when and where you saw us whilst being a ghosty, buuuut thats for a different topic later.</span><br />
[01:56:27] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Well, it was just multiple times in different places.</span><br />
[01:56:37] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I drifted on skaia for a long while and saw a lot in the clouds.</span><br />
[01:56:46] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But then everything got all...glitchy.</span><br />
[01:57:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah yes, the infamous glitchy skaia thing. ➜</span><br />
[01:58:00] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Aaaah... Well, the Clouds were glitched, and even then, they had points where it's not sure when the images shown would be relevant, reportedly.</span><br />
[01:58:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, the one who mantiuoned that wasn't exactly the ost trustworthy either... ➜</span><br />
[01:58:46] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hmph...</span><br />
[01:59:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm referring to the blog post on the guardian's blog. ➜</span><br />
[02:00:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: back when chronos used to run it. ➜</span><br />
[02:01:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[02:01:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uncaptchas a piece of chocolate --</span><br />
[02:01:59] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: =|</span><br />
[02:02:02] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Man this sucks so bad.</span><br />
[02:02:05] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I guess my next question is.</span><br />
[02:02:12] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Could someone explain my role to me please?</span><br />
[02:02:14] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I never understood it.</span><br />
[02:02:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, have you studied at least basic classpect theory? ➜</span><br />
[02:03:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oooooh joy... Honestly, you should ask the other space players, especially the one that shares your title. Even then... bleh. It depends on the person. </span><br />
[02:03:12] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -But classpect theory does help, yeah.</span><br />
[02:03:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Prince of Space?</span><br />
[02:04:34] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the prince class, as you alredy know, is a destroyer class. And when paired with the aspect of space implies a focus on the active destruction of space, as well as actively destroying with space. ➜</span><br />
[02:04:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that can mean quite a few things. ➜</span><br />
[02:05:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, so you might hate frogs, or you might be really good at making gravity wells to crush objects.</span><br />
[02:05:27] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: =[</span><br />
[02:05:33] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: This doesn't sound so good.</span><br />
[02:05:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or you could wind up re-inventing the Death Star. ➜</span><br />
[02:05:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[02:05:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Do you hate frogs by any chance?</span><br />
[02:06:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but really, destroying doesn't have to have a negative end result. ➜</span><br />
[02:06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh yeah, Antimatter reactors!</span><br />
[02:07:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, you could bring things closer together by destroying the space between them. ➜</span><br />
[02:07:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or you could crush an object enough to apply enough pressure to cause nuclear fusion in a fusion reactor.</span><br />
[02:08:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles... always with the antimatter... ➜</span><br />
[02:08:35] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I guess...i dunno.</span><br />
[02:08:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  rolls her eyes and sighs --</span><br />
[02:08:42] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I'm supposed to wear glasses but keep breaking them?</span><br />
[02:08:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  holds up two fingers. --</span><br />
[02:08:47] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I guess that doesn't make much sense.</span><br />
[02:08:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I only ever used it twice.</span><br />
[02:08:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Once if you don't count DT as being me.</span><br />
[02:09:00] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I think frogs are cute. I did stand on them a lot..</span><br />
[02:09:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but you talk about it like a girlfriend ➜</span><br />
[02:09:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Two times too many, in any case.</span><br />
[02:09:15] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Oh, i made a black hole.</span><br />
[02:09:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, are you sure you aren't a bard of space? ➜</span><br />
[02:09:24] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: That was a thing that happened.</span><br />
[02:09:41] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Pretty sure!</span><br />
[02:09:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /one/ time too many.</span><br />
[02:09:48] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I got prince stuffed down my brain hole WAY too much.</span><br />
[02:09:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The other was completely required.</span><br />
[02:10:09] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Why a bard?</span><br />
[02:10:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: beause that one tends to fall more along the accidental destruction side of things. ➜</span><br />
[02:10:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: at least according to popular classpect theory. ➜</span><br />
[02:11:35] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Bleh i never understood it all.</span><br />
[02:11:39] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I mean..i do break stuff?</span><br />
[02:11:54] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But...man everytime i mention any stuff that MIGHT have to do with it i sound like a nutjob!</span><br />
[02:12:07] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: My best bro used to say things i say and do fit my role but i couldn't disagree more.</span><br />
[02:12:10] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Like stupid stuff!</span><br />
[02:12:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright, you just gotta learn control. ➜</span><br />
[02:12:23] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I go on a long rant about my issues with art and the stupidity of it all and that's apparantly it? HOW.</span><br />
[02:12:46] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: He calls me a personal space invader too. </span><br />
[02:12:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, space is also associated with creativity. ➜</span><br />

[02:13:05] <span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Cause he has to be such a "stoic" "apathetic" "COOLGUY".</span><br />
[02:13:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh... look, you'll have lots of time to figure it out. There is no rush to find out what your classpect means for you.</span><br />
