<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, if at all possible, play it on a different system than you have pesterchum running on. SRB2 /hates/ fullscreen-tabouts, and windowed mode is currently hardcode-locked to 200x120 resolution :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, until 2.1 comes out.</span><br />
