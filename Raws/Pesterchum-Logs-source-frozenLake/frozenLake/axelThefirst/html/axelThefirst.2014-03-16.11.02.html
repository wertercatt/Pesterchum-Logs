[11:02:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...do I know you?</span><br />
[11:02:57] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: yes</span><br />
[11:03:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...funny, I can't recall.</span><br />
[11:03:38] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: Just press B</span><br />
[11:04:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I don't get it.</span><br />
[11:05:53] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: It doesn't mind</span><br />
[11:07:21] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: Just... a question</span><br />
[11:07:42] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: You know what hits harder than this?</span><br />
[11:08:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Um... something moving at the speed of light?</span><br />
[11:08:23] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: Well, I would say a hammer</span><br />
[11:08:35] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: But a hammer moving at the speed of light hits harder</span><br />
[11:09:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It hits the same as an object the same size also moving at the literal speed of light, due to the effects that physics has near the speed of light</span><br />
[11:09:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Still have no idea who you are, sorry.</span><br />
[11:15:00] <span style="color:#bd2f00">AT: I neither know who you are so its okay</span><br />
