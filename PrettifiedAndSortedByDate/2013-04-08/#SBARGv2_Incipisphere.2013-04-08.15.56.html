<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: a PK?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a player killer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff557f">CTN: also the strife card costs like, 20 Build grist so it's no problem</span><br />

<span style="color:#ecd20d">CEU: Because as good hearted as people are we are in a game equipped with amazing weapons and being forced to grind for better weapons and more grist before presumably being turned loose on other player's Lands and if I know one thing it's that people are bastards that will wreck any magnificent plan you put into action because it is human nature to destroy even as we try to build!!!</span><br />

<span style="color:#ecd20d">CEU: You'd best find a way to make some in case of tight pinches when your sprite isn't there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ecd20d">CEU: Let me see if I've got any codes for those...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff557f">CTN: does anyone have a code for an archery-bow? Not a hair bow.</span><br />
