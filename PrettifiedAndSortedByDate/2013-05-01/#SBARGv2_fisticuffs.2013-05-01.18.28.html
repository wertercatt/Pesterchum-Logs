<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: The pro8lem is that when the su8ject of leprechaun romance is 8roached, our overly o8essive troll intellects instantly assume the most ingrati8ting posture of admir8tion imagina8le.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: Which makes it hard! Hard to give it proper academic focus I mean, 8ecause of how gr8 it is.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: 8ut we will do our 8est to understand rega</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f"><span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: Trolls have only four forms of romance. And though we consider it a complic8ted su8ject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implic8tions for reproduction, it is ultim8tely a superficial slice of what leprechauns consider the full 8ody of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to r</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, quaternary concept. A concept usually denoted 8y four sym8ols.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: <span style="color:#bf0000">♥</span> <span style="color:#000000">♠</span> <span style="color:#c39797">♦</span> o8&lt;  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: Leprechaun romance is more complic8ted than that. Leprechaun romance needs nine sym8ols.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: The nine quadrants of leprechaun romance are co</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">than our quaint notions of romance, and certainly more alien.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: In fact, so conditioned is my own understanding of romance that I can't help 8ut refer to them as quadrants, when in fact they are not quadrants at all! They are referred to as charms.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: One of the charms is characterized 8y romantic love, as understood 8y 8oth trolls and humans. 8ut</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">are off. There is no division 8etween 8lack or red, concupiscent or conciliatory. Instead their charms comprise a spectral continuum of more su8tly varying types of relationships, most of which are esta8lished in mutual chicanery, such as the exchange of pranks, coy riddles, slapstick shenanigans, and games of chance. Furthermore, a pair of leprechauns is not limited to a single charm. A rela</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">defined 8y multiple charms at once! In fact, some of the most interesting relationships arise from exotic charm com8in8tions. A sta8le relationship consisting of three or more charms is called a trove. These advanced relationships are often viewed as the ideal end result for a romance, much the way certain pairing rituals are for humans.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: No charm is specifically tied</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">though any type of relationship could 8egin waxing concupiscent if lady luck should so decide. Certain charm com8in8tions are known to 8e more conducive to fertility than others. If the leprechaun pair has 8een so 8lessed, they will 8egin an ela8orate coupling procedure culmin8ting in a lively m8ting jig. The jigs are specific to the charms of course, similar to how different kinds of music l</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">various styles of dance.  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: While their romance is endlessly captiv8ting, leprechaun reproduction may 8e the most interesting su8ject of all. Particularly from a perspective of detailed anatomical study, which I will get to shortly. 8ut first it 8ears pointing out that while for humans reproductive relationships are exclusively hete<span style="color:#b536da">Rose</span>xual, and for tro</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">8isexual, for leprechauns they-  <span style="color:#005682">Vriska</span>: WOW, WHAT A STORY!!!!!!!!  <span style="color:#005682">Aranea</span>: 8ut I wasn't fin-  <span style="color:#005682">Vriska</span>: WASN'T THAT STORY GRb EVERYONE?  <span style="color:#005682">Vriska</span>: WOW!!!!!!!!</span><br />
