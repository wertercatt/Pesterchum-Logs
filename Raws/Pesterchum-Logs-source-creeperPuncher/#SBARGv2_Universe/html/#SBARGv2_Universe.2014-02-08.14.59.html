<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Metroid Prime 2, Banjo Tooie, or Donkey Kong 64?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: haven't played any of them actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh... that's a tough decision... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: are we actually gonna play multiplayer?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: holy freak show, Ben...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: eh i figure i can hold her off for the 5 minutes shes online</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: plus you know shes no player killer</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Am I just stupid or does a Carmen Sandiego cosplay seem perfect for Gambit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: she talks like shes hot shit but</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: SL, have you ever been shot by Gambit?  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *Ben ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: couple times</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: SL, she's killed me at least 6 times just for the hell of it, and only because I was Tiered.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: She will not hesitate to end you life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: never heroically or justly</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O;;; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: She only kills tiered people it seems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and thats /only/ because they come back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: she kills for fun when theres no permanent damage</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not to mention, remember that dungeon on LoSaCurses?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: So she can "play" with them some more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: seriously death loses most of its impact when youre tiered</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: she basically TPK'd like four times in there...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how could anyone forget that time... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Something tells me she would love most of the games in the AU Machine</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...someone should introduce her to them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And would be best friends with Mario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, the thing still needs to be uncorrupted. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (mario is completely and utterly /twisted/)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it got corrupted?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes it did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: (You watch GameTheorists too much.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, are we actually gonna play something multiplayer? if not, I'm either gonna see if Mirror's Edge has stopped hating my desktop, or try the original version of "Octodad".</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: octodad is hype</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All because Tollo caused a major system failure when in an... Elken AU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: au where everyone is elk?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sorry, Eiken</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think there might be something wrong with Tollo to be honest</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaaanyways, still trying to plan some stuff for the background story behind Jaws 5. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how are they going to kill the super shark?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still trying to think of how "they" are going to fight it, not sure if the supershark is going to be defeated though. ➜</span><br />
