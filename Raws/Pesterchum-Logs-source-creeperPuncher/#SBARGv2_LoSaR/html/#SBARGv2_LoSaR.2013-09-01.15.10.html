<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Jeez, after all this, you guys are still wimps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Toast me if anybody needs my participation for whatever reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly walks back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Whenever I pull this thing out, it's supoosed to freak out my eneimes. That's the effect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, I figure an Ink Portal would be much faster.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: <span style="color:#bacafe">Bacafe</span> you said?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: It's literally designed t make enemjes go mad from the revelation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...it's making me dizzy looking at... whatever it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe6a27">[CPO]</span>  yoinks the rest of the honey --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: tell me that thing's not a memetic hazard...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Incidentally, it also randomly either cuts or bludgeons the opponent. Pretty much, if you can imagine a handheld, short-range weapon doing something, it probably can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Just be glad you aren't an enemy :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: ((Awesome.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Heh, i always get awesome weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: And if anyone wants to draw it for whatever reason, just put like a conspicuous empty space that blots out the background with some random lines in the general area around PO's hands.</span><br />
