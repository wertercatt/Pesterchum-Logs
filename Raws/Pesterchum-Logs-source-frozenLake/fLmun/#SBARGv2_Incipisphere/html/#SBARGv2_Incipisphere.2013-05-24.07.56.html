<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like he knows exactly what I'm thinking...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should bargain</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus I'm pretty sure it could kill me easily.</span><br />

<span style="color:#339966">PDP: i tried going back to fight him after our bargain</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I know that the right choice is to bargain... and he would be a powerful ally.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I'm just trying to think of the best choice... as soon as I would make the choise to kill it, I think it would kno- STOP NODDING.</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">PDP: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, it doesn't have any eyes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or ears.</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">PDP: noticed</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So I believe that it takes its sensory input from... mindreading.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The answer is pretty obvious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">PDP: *think</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">PDP: well</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">PDP: the curbstomp isnt that bad</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm talking to this guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">PDP: alright, geez.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Screw the guardian.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My prescratch self may be right.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, I hate waking up early...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but now's the only time when the best fish come out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I can't time travel yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: gonna see if using cheesy 5's instead of cheesy fries as bait will work better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I did a search on my denizens name...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It goes by "The Traal".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and I found it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, except it was smart...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It kinda... well, its sensory information came from mind reading.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which explains the towel trick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has no input whatsoever if noone is around...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which kinda sucks for it as it gets hungry alot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After a brief confrontation with it... (of the minds!) I left with the tablet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa, you did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was more of a confrontational talk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was a clash of ideas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Confrontation does not always mean a physical fight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...he won the confrontation anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, then how did you get the tablet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, this guy would be great at poker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...If he could see the cards.</span><br />
