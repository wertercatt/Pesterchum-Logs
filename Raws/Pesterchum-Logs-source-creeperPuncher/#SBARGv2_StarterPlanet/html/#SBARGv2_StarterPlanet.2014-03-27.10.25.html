[10:32] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  shrugs, tilting her head back with a grin before cracking her knuckles, walking over and... holding her fist out to FF. --</span><br />

[10:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  immediately lashes out, trying to grab FF's fist and yank him forward. Is OBSCENELY strong, terrifyingly so. --</span><br />
[10:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads outside and quietly gets into a tree to get a better view (as well as to intervene if necessary) --</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  is stupidly tought, scarily so, as well as very strong, and lets him yank her towards her, swinging an elbow at her face. --</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  takes the elbow to the face in full. Doesn't even budge besides the obvious face...smushing from anything pressing against skin. --</span><br />

[10:40] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  smirks and adjusts her grip on his hand. Her key-based ability kicks in! Since skin contact is pretty firmly made, she'd try and seal away an ability FF has. In this case, strength. Should it be successful he'd become buff-human tiers in strength. It was a trick the whole time *O*! --</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...mmmm...</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  tries to sweep her legs from underneath her while also trying to get away from her, eyes sparking a bit. --</span><br />

[10:43] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Nope. </span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  takes in a deep breath and then ROARS, deafening, like being in the front row of a metalic concert who's speakers are up to eleven, blowing back her hair and clothes from the force of it. --</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  raises her other hand, putting a pinkie in her ear and twisting it. --</span><br />

[10:46] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...So thats your ability huh?</span><br />
[10:46] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: You have no idea what my ability is.</span><br />
[10:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  should the Key ability have been successful, a Rage theme'd key would appear on her wrist. --</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I have an idea. You can 'cancle things' or 'lock things'.</span><br />
[10:49] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Wow, actually. You know that's the smartest thing I've heard since I showed up here.</span><br />
[10:49] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Good on you.</span><br />

[10:50] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  So did the Key ability work or not, is there a good enough reason for it -not- to work? --</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  she took away his strenght, but not his toughness, so I guess yes. --</span><br />
[10:52] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: So are you done slapping me or do you still have a few more excuses of hits to throw at me.</span><br />
[10:54] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Well... I could shock you or use my Anti-Battleship War Club “Calamity”, but I think you are too full of BS for that to do much against you.</span><br />

[10:54] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Fair enough.</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Don't mock it until you seen it in action.</span><br />
[10:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  pulls her free hand back in less than an instant, keeping a hold on his wrist and throwing a punch straight for his chest. Provided it hit, it'd feel like a train hitting a /normal/ person. --</span><br />
[10:58] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  takes the hits, stumbling back a bit, not wanting to let her lock/cancle another ability, Whincing a bit. --</span><br />
[10:58] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Ow.</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  lets go of his wrist as he stumbles, moving into his guard immediately and throwing an uppercut while he's wincing. --</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  takes the hit, but uses he momentum to try and suplex her, moving away once thats done or it does't work. --</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  turns her wrist forward and attempts to shield bash him in the nose the moment her touches her for the suplex. --</span><br />

[11:04] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  again takes the hit, nose bleeding, but still tries to suplex her. --</span><br />
[11:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  is probably suplexed, using the contact to try and grab onto his neck and hold herself there. --</span><br />
[11:06] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  is grabbes, a hand going to nose and two hooking into it, trying to pull it up and cause her discomfort/pain --</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  grins, attempting to seal away his "Toughness" with the same ability. If successful, it'd appear as an iron themed key on her other wrist. Meanwhile her eyes water from the nose attack, her thumbs pressing against Fool's neck out of reflex. --</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  gags, cursing a bit, his other hand flying towards her face, two fingers heading towards her eyes --</span><br />
