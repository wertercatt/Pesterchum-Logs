[10:19:43] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: my land is made for me</span><br />
[10:19:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also quest beds and that shit.</span><br />

[10:20:22] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I'm pretty sure I can only use the quest bed located there...</span><br />
[10:20:26] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: and my Denizen...</span><br />
[10:20:27] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Don't make me limit ya, AG.</span><br />
[10:20:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm a god though.</span><br />

[10:21:11] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I can summon the light to manipulate the imps on my land</span><br />
[10:21:15] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm?</span><br />
[10:21:24] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I found that out a little while ago</span><br />
[10:21:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can kill shit.</span><br />
[10:21:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: dammit If anyone uses the "I'm a god" excuse again I am going to choke someone.</span><br />
[10:21:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We /all/ can.</span><br />
[10:21:37] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: WD is one of my alτ handles whaτ is going on</span><br />
[10:21:44] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: Eeep.</span><br />
[10:21:47] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … FL, no, I was saying that's why it doesn't matter about quest beds.</span><br />
[10:21:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[10:21:50] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: um</span><br />
[10:21:57] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Problem is, it only works if I use prisms...</span><br />
[10:21:58] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Who are you</span><br />
[10:22:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah, but EG /isn't/</span><br />

[10:22:15] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: I'm..uhh..</span><br />

[10:23:02] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: The consorts said something about a huge prism of endless colors that i'm supposed to make over the entire sky? Anyone got any ideas about that?</span><br />
[10:23:28] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: using your light powers to refract from things might be part of it</span><br />
[10:23:42] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Thats what I was thinking</span><br />
[10:23:50] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: But what am I supposed to use them ON</span><br />
[10:24:12] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: maybe it has to do with rearranging these bookshelves so that all the beams can connect?</span><br />
[10:24:24] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yes that sounds like it</span><br />
[10:24:24] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I dunno</span><br />
[10:24:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shh</span><br />
[10:24:41] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: I..I can explain...</span><br />
[10:24:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WD and TT are having a moment</span><br />
[10:24:49] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Would someone maybe help me move them</span><br />
[10:24:53] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: these shelves are huge.</span><br />
[10:24:59] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Maybe, EG.</span><br />
[10:25:06] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i could come over maybe though i don't think i'd be much help</span><br />
[10:25:32] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: I..uhh...don't use pesterchum often, that's all!</span><br />
[10:25:39] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...huh...</span><br />
[10:25:43] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Its going to take a LOT of strength to move these huge shelves</span><br />
[10:26:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I remember joking on the Hotel memo that EP might have managed to create a magical manifestation...</span><br />
[10:26:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if WD is one?</span><br />
[10:26:42] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: maybe it's part of ya land quest, EG?</span><br />
[10:26:53] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I know it is...</span><br />
[10:27:00] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Unless...</span><br />
[10:27:18] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Maybe I have to move them with light somehow?</span><br />
[10:27:23] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: W-what do you mean</span><br />
[10:27:36] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: actually that sounds a lot more like a light player</span><br />
[10:27:50] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they dont really deal with brute force</span><br />
[10:28:08] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you might be more able once you go god tier</span><br />
[10:28:24] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I guess it might have to do with some kind of solar energy or something like that?</span><br />
[10:29:03] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[10:29:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: love how two different subjects are happening and my brain feels it has to take both in at once.</span><br />
[10:29:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I really do.</span><br />
[10:29:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">beepbeepbeepbeep</span></span><br />
[10:29:36] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I wish I had my house still...</span><br />
[10:29:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.gif</span><br />
[10:29:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Huh, I thought I turned that off.</span></span><br />
[10:29:55] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what happened to your house?</span><br />
[10:30:08] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: It got destroyed before I entered the medium</span><br />
[10:30:34] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: There was a big earthquake a couple hours before I even started the game...</span><br />
[10:30:50] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that sucks</span><br />
[10:30:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you mean meteors hitting nearby.</span><br />
[10:30:59] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Leveled the place except for the bottom floor, which has a huge hole in the roof</span><br />
[10:31:02] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: It wasn't meteors</span><br />
[10:31:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Judging from the ammount of months...</span><br />
[10:31:12] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: this was several hours before the meteors started falling</span><br />
[10:31:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how many months has it been?</span><br />
[10:31:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: gosh... it's been a while, thats for sure...</span><br />
[10:31:45] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
[10:32:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all months = hours for the entry time... its weird.</span><br />
[10:32:19] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: hm.</span><br />
[10:32:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Most of us entered in the first hour of meteors falling.</span><br />
[10:33:03] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: So yeah, if you see the ruins of a home when you pass through my land, don't be surprised</span><br />
[10:33:14] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: yikes<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[10:33:30] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FL, I have a theory about that.</span><br />
[10:33:33] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm...</span><br />
[10:33:42] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: ?</span><br />
[10:33:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes?</span><br />
[10:35:44] <span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: I am so lost.</span><br />
[10:35:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's been a bit more than five months since the session began, I think...</span><br />
[10:36:06] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: damn really</span><br />
[10:36:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'around that amount of time, yeah.</span><br />
[10:36:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So perhaps 5 hours since the meteors started falling.</span><br />
[10:36:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Back on earth.</span><br />
[10:36:28] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Basically, because of all the glitches, there was lag in between somme people entering and some actually ending.</span><br />
[10:36:45] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ive slept a lot and been on my own a lot but five months</span><br />
[10:36:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like that room in DBZ where a year was a day.</span><br />
[10:36:57] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm</span><br />
[10:37:09] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: hyperbolic time chamber</span><br />
[10:37:16] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'would make sense, kinda.</span><br />
[10:37:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except in this case a year in here would be half a day.</span><br />
[10:38:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or 12 hours.</span><br />
[10:38:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for 12 months</span><br />
[10:39:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: i need to sleep</span><br />
[10:39:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: good night</span><br />
[10:39:43] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Oh god damnit</span><br />
