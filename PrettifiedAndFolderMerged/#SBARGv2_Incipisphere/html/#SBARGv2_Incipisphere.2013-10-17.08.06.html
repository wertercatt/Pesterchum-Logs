[08:07:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000c1">CURRENT matrixAssassin [CMA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:07:20] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So FL. Why is it that you come in here so early in the morning?</span><br />
[08:07:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I finally have a break from all the damn business meetings with the consorts.</span><br />
[08:08:48] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: You always say things like there's people actually active in here, or things you seem to think nobody will see later if they happen to be away due to it being drowned out by other logs.</span><br />
[08:12:02] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: I saw what you said about the Void players yesterday morning. I do not appreciate it.</span><br />
[08:12:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ehhh</span><br />
[08:12:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I better work on making specialized weapons to aim at voiders... seriously, they are OP.</span><br />
[08:13:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "I'm gonna successfully dodge everything you throw at me because I AM A VOID PLAYER AND NOTHING IS GONNA STOP ME."</span><br />
[08:13:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering you guys /can/ see, I guess I should make more seisure grenades</span><br />
[08:13:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh hey gambit, nice copy pasting me</span><br />
[08:13:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait.</span><br />
[08:13:25] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: That was me, you asshole.</span><br />
[08:13:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...sorry, I guess I'm too used to gambit using IRC</span><br />
[08:14:47] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Why the hell would you even /consider/ doing something like that, huh?</span><br />
[08:15:01] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: How is that going to help anything?</span><br />
[08:15:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Quite simple.</span><br />
[08:15:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I am able to figure out a way to attack voided void players, its quite logical that Chronos will be able to do so as well.</span><br />
[08:16:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As such, we need to get them trained back for normal combat.</span><br />
[08:16:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course thats the excuse</span><br />
[08:17:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: my real reason is that I feel weak and insignificant against the void players and actually want a way to stand up to them.</span><br />
[08:17:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I don't feel /hopeless/ if one decides that my torso will be a great spot to put knives.</span><br />
[08:19:40] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Okay, so, you know how I'm a Seer and shit? You'd think it'd be possible for me to be able to find a Void player, right? Maybe?</span><br />
[08:19:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, kinda doubt it at this point.</span><br />
[08:20:29] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Haha nope, I'm just as blind as you are. Yet I fair against Gambit generally fine, even when she uses her Void abilities.</span><br />
[08:20:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, somehow they can see and hear, but their voided bodys have no interaction with soundwaves or light?</span><br />
[08:22:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is normally required for that kind of shit?</span><br />
[08:22:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, considering how much this session has fucked physics already, I shouldn't be shocked</span><br />
[08:23:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell me MA, how do you fight a being who isn't actually there and can drop knives into your lungs?</span><br />
[08:24:52] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Mindgames. Baiting.</span><br />
[08:25:24] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: It's not something that has to do with some sort item I have that cancels out their abilities or some shit like that.</span><br />
[08:25:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what are you a seer of again?</span><br />
[08:26:03] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Breath.</span><br />
[08:26:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I thought it was mind or something, oh well</span><br />
[08:26:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the point I was trying to make is that... I /suck/ at trying mindgames.</span><br />
[08:27:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and baiting is just going to get a perfectly generic object telefragging my brain.</span><br />
[08:28:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why would they need to phase back in to fight if they can just replace my internal organs with pointy objects?</span><br />
[08:30:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not a matter of negating what they do... its a matter of /working around it, finding the loopholes/</span><br />

[08:32:31] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Wouldn't negating fall into that category anyway?</span><br />
[08:32:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps.</span><br />
[08:33:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But there is nothing better than letting them realize their powers are useless.</span><br />
[08:33:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I suppose /that/ is my mindgame.</span><br />
[08:34:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Letting them see the other side of the coin for a change.</span><br />
[08:35:48] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Well, have fun figuring out how to do that, then.</span><br />

[09:27:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[09:27:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Curiouser and curiouser.</span><br />
[09:31:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or rather, I suppose I shouldn't say curiousâ€¦ nah. Nothing /curious/ about it in the least.</span><br />
[09:32:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Typicaler and typicaler just doesn't sound the same, though.</span><br />
[09:35:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you going to drop another knife into my skull?</span><br />
[09:35:47] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nah.</span><br />
[09:36:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean, while I'm totally pleased and all that the first thing I'm feeling upon waking up is slowly burgeoning fury, FS has been trying to get me to work on that sort of thing.</span><br />
[09:36:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And it would only "validate" you anyway.</span><br />
[09:37:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True..</span><br />
[09:38:31] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Besides. What's inside your lungs right now?</span><br />
[09:38:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again I bet this is going to get twisted so I'm the bad guy in this, so lets skip all of that and go right to the point where you insult me over the memo.</span><br />
[09:38:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Air?</span><br />
[09:39:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Mhm.</span><br />
[09:39:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's fun is that there is also nothing in your lungs.</span><br />
[09:39:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, if there was nothing in my lungs that would be a vaccum.</span><br />
[09:40:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nah.</span><br />
[09:40:31] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've tried the principle out, it works.</span><br />
[09:40:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (obviously I'm using science to convince you to not steal the space inside of my lungs)</span><br />
[09:40:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (but it isn't working)</span><br />
[09:40:59] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (obviously I've already tried this to know it works)</span><br />
[09:41:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah I'm just... on a scale of 1 to 10, how far will I need to run before you get tired ot chasing me?</span><br />
[09:41:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: All I'm saying, really, is that while you may be right to worry about Void Players, specifically a certain Thief, filling your organs with objects, you're wrong to think we need to be intangible to do it.</span><br />
[09:42:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:42:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
[09:42:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And that I was getting bored and ignoring you, in fact have /not/ been paying any attention to you or chasing you...</span><br />
[09:42:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And then you've gotta go and say shit like this.</span><br />
[09:42:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ,,,</span><br />
[09:42:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:42:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah I'm just</span><br />
[09:43:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gonna make a book fort</span><br />
[09:43:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But no. FS is really trying to work with me on this whole "/not/ randomly murdering people".</span><br />
[09:43:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah but I bet you might be able to convince everyone it isn't random</span><br />
[09:43:59] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Working past provocative comments to not respond in kind and suchlike.</span><br />
[09:44:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I know one thing.</span><br />
[09:44:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not making my situation any better.</span><br />
[09:44:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I think that's the smartest thing you've said all day.</span><br />
[09:46:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if thats the smartest thing I've said all day then what is the smartest thing I've said all session?</span><br />
[09:46:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That would require me to have a much longer memory span for things you say.</span><br />
[09:47:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
[09:47:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I am already perfectly aware that Chronos may be able to negate or get around my Void abilities as he could /all/ Aspect abilities, as I've faced several boss monsters with similar capabilities, and do /not/ think that he would be so dumb as to try bullshit like quantum and flash grenades. I am perfectly capable of fighting without Void and do so on a regular basis.</span><br />
[09:48:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FS tends to not phase much at all, just when he feels it's necessary, since if he doesn't have to go intangible he can still get some damage in during the motion.</span><br />
[09:48:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah I guess I did pull off a dick move somehow causing those weapons of his to cease to exist.</span><br />
[09:49:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like /how the fuck did I do that/</span><br />
[09:49:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I wasn't there. I am unaware.</span><br />
[09:49:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just grabbed them and they went poof.</span><br />
[09:49:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One was red and the other was blue...</span><br />
[09:49:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like I said. Wasn't there.</span><br />
[09:50:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think they were called parens?</span><br />
[09:50:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If I wasn't there to see the situation and have not seen him fight with them before, I'm not going to know, no matter how much you say, since you don't know as well.</span><br />
[09:51:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll ask ash if she has a recording of the battle</span><br />
[09:51:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if she does, ask her to send it to you</span><br />
[09:51:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or I could, y'know, ask FS about it.</span><br />
[09:51:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay.</span><br />
[09:51:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: They're his weapons, he might know.</span><br />
[09:51:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That works too.</span><br />
[09:53:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So since we are perfectly capable of fighting unphased, do so on a regular basis, and are perfectly aware of the threat Chronos might pause, you may stop figuring out how to get around or negate our abilities.</span><br />
[09:54:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Since your politically correct reason is proven null and, dare I say it, void.</span><br />
[09:54:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...eh, screw politics then</span><br />
[09:54:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like I said, that was a stupid excuse.</span><br />
[09:55:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So you're working on it so you don't feel helpless despite the fact the Void Players have primarily been ignoring you and incidentally can simply fill your lungs with perfectly generic material from a much longer distance.</span><br />
[09:56:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or to get back at us and show us how it feels to be "powerless".</span><br />
[09:56:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, that is the idiotic reason I am currently listening to like an idiot because I am an idiotic idiot</span><br />
[09:56:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That shines doubt on both our ingenuity and fighting skills. I appreciate the compliment and the amount of pathetically bitter bile that went into saying it.</span><br />
[10:07:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So you're going to keep up this course of action, then?</span><br />
