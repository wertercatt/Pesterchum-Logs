[11:29:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeahhhh</span><br />
[11:29:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I already thought of a "back door" that involves alchemy.</span><br />
[11:29:51] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: well shit</span><br />
[11:29:59] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: wait what if</span><br />
[11:30:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, this will still require us to pick out a few people to go through.</span><br />
[11:30:12] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: we like captchalogue the players who cant enter</span><br />
[11:30:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats exactly what I thought.</span><br />
[11:30:27] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: can we do that though</span><br />
[11:30:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Great minds think alike... or so it goes.</span><br />
[11:30:37] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: is that even possible through all the layers of meta</span><br />
[11:30:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Players /can/ be captchaed, I am living proof.</span><br />
[11:30:52] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah maybe we are great minds</span><br />
[11:31:08] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that's good maybe we can make it work</span><br />
[11:31:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like a white void in the card, and it has an internet connection.</span><br />
[11:31:26] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that's even better wow</span><br />
[11:31:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have managed to break it into four steps.</span><br />
[11:31:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1. We send someone through and see if they can contact us.</span><br />
[11:32:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2. We send someone through with a captchaed consort, and see if that works</span><br />
[11:32:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3. If 2 works, we send someone through with a captchaed player (of the same class and aspect as people who have already gone through)</span><br />
[11:33:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 4. If that works, we captcha all the lands in the session, as well as the remaining players, and go through.</span><br />
[11:33:40] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: hell yeah that sounds like a good plan</span><br />
[11:33:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 5. We have a Time player be the last person to go through incase this goes to hell.</span><br />
[11:33:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I guess 5 steps.</span><br />
[11:34:02] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: sounds solid and we can probably make it work</span><br />
[11:34:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know its possible to captcha lands, as I have managed small meteors in the past.</span><br />
[11:34:35] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: we're going to need really big captcha decks though</span><br />
[11:34:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As well as the fact that captcha cards /can/ be made with artifact grist.</span><br />

[11:35:26] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i don't know how many people there are in this chaos-ridden hellhole of a session but we'll need double that in terms of cards</span><br />

[11:35:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my modus works on terms of storage space, and not limited cards.</span><br />
[11:36:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean theres a good chance chronos is lying out of his ass</span><br />
[11:36:17] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: this is true</span><br />
[11:36:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe that Chronos might have told us (if its the truth) to get us to fight over who gets to go through the door.</span><br />
[11:36:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well yeah</span><br />

[11:37:08] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: agreed</span><br />
[11:37:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 5 step plan, that is.</span><br />
[11:37:30] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: alright</span><br />
[11:37:41] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i have to say charles, this is the first non-awful idea youve had</span><br />
[11:37:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I added having a time player be the last person to go through incase everything goes to hell and we need to undo it.</span><br />
[11:37:57] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: as probably one of the only seers of mind it is definitely plausible like the logic is good and shit</span><br />
