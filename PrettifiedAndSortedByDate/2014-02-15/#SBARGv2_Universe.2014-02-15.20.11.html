<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: TT is being a feral wolf but otherwise no</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Oh great.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not so much "feral wolf" as "pseudo-grimdark".</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ugh.jpeg</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I guess "again" is the right word for this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...How did Rose get rid of Grim Dark?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: she died ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I was afraid of that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yes, that's literally how she got over it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: You... wouldnt happen to know if</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: That</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: kinda sorta</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: MIGHT</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: work on kat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: it wont</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it could, but it may be hard to tell. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: two problems: we don't know if it's actually a form of grimdark, and attempting that may somehow end up as a Just Death for reasons of "Paradox Space hates us"</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Well I can bring her back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you can? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I don't have Muse of Life for nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I walk on dead grass and it comes back to life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: hey stay off desertia, The residents like it the way it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Sorry, I don't know if I can turn off the passive feature.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: It just sort of, happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I don't want to put her through that, but if it comes down to it, we might need to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: knowing our luck, she'll probably still hate us horribly. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: especially considering life player envy. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: she never liked me so shrug.gif</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: o h . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, the cause of her last breakdown was the stuff surrounding the Chaos Dunk incident. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: when they called Ben and she felt useless just because he could revive players by default instead of using a dangerous 2 player fraymotif. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in the end, FL wound up getting revived via a 3rd option anyways. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: -_-; ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: hes just</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: bouncing a ball</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: and talking</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why didn't simply talking to her work before? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: no idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: i think it has to do with the fact hes a Doom player</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it might be. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I think I heard she was backstabbed by a doom player or something...</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: that guy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: she's still upset about the sylph? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AD: a guy from the session. we... don't like to talk about him that much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: that bad huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he was kinda manipulative ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...i see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and probably the reason why we don't have a specific "leader". ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: oh sheesh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... Kat's gone shithive maggots because she's remembering him, huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: or maybe remembering him is the only reason why we can get close to her now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: in some, weird backwards way</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it might have some stuff to do with aspect inversion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ever hear about that theory? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. it's one of the more common mechanical explanations of grimdarkness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Light Players act Voidy, Life Players apparently act Doomy, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, apparently a player has a chance of embracing the opposite aspect of their "true calling" if they're under a certain behavioral condition. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and it usually doesn't end well at all. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Sounds pretty complicated</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...yeah... Rose only snapped out of it through stabs, and even though Jade's grimbarkness was artificially induced, it still took a house to the head...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in a way, that could be used to explain the sylph's actions, considering it also can cover classes... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's the opposite class of Sylph?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: prince ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a rince of life is said to destroy life, which can be applied towards life players as well. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *prince ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: like, shes not asleep but shes not making noise any more</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this iseither a good sign or a not-so-good sign. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm hoping for the former. ➜</span><br />
