<span style="color:#802020">CFL: In order to stop us from stopping him, he even destroyed our lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Apparently this guy was so bad that Lord English even ate his genesis frog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that must've tasted bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I'm pretty sure that's exaggeration.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: All he did was destroy it outright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (also, is it me or did SkaiaPad just die?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (not just you, I saw it too)</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((first the mass pesternetsplit earlier, now this))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Our goal... Our goal was to sabatoge the session in its entirety then Scratch what was left. Direct combat was... fruitless, and so the only means to defeat him was wiping him from existence completely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, obviously he managed to escape, either by ollying into the Ring or punching a fenestrated wall</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably the first one.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: why do we have τo τell τhe guardian</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I figure that my Pre Scratch self will have taken my place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ah...a?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, if I start using blood powers, tell the guardian.</span><br />
