<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Afternoon, probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Recaping and deciding on this whole course of action bullshit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: First of what'll hopefully be weekly meetings, too. Just 'cause.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Kay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: And Trying to find good music?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And not recaping the /entire session/ because that's dumb, not getting sidetracked by somebody's desire to go /camping/ or fainting</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well, I hope at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We're supposed to be a team but for the most part we're a bunch of fucks faffing around in our own individual corners not really /doing/ much of anything.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like when FI was attacking people?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because the common idea was to sit on our hands</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: but there were meetings</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just not huge ones</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ignorance he was complacent in but hey details right?</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i didnt even bother fighting him :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: me either, but mostly because it would've been sudokucidal for me to try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean when he came for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Hank was probably one of the few that COULD fight Seth safely, and he /still/ got taken out in the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i knew i wasnt gonna win, so i didnt even bother</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and she's trying to adjust to that, like I had to adjust when I self-prototyped</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...It did strike me as odd, her reaction. She seems a lot more emotionally crumbly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably being tiered with Ashsprite</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ashsprite was pretty emotionally crumbly</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the fact that shes well... a sensitive person in general</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: everybody here is a flawed motherfucker, myself included</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, thank you? &gt;_&gt; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: See, I used to think that. Then I realized that people, when their flaws are brought up, are far more likely to either do one of two things</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 1. Curl up into a pile of sad and say "No he's wrong" until they become a shallow husk of that one flaw you pointed out</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#008141">There Are Not Enough Finish Crumbs In Paradox Space To Describe My Opinion About That</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or 2. Actively try to improve themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but if the first is their reaction, then can anything get them to change?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Far more people are number 1. so insults just become pointless bullying</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most people resist change very strongly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and it doesnt help that a lot of people have these echo chambers who tell them that theyre perfect and special and nothing needs to change</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and thats arguably worse</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah arguably. The trick is finding people who aren't like that</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no those people need to be sought out</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're forcing them deeper into their echo chambers</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because somebody has to</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: do you know how to get them out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because if you have a suggestion id love to hear it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's not whining at them and complaining at them with little jabs</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: People in those "echo chambers" need to come out themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: More often than not that gets done by just ignoring them unless you have any positive things to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but they never will</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: they need to be forced out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Throwing firecrackers into the hole of a baby rabbit will not force it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It will just make it scared of the outside world</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is good, because they can be eaten outside. But it's bad, because life continues on without this baby rabbit on the ecosystem</span><br />
