<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I thought it would be a good idea to make a nuclear reactor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For later alchemitation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: where did you get the grist for that???</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, its all about scale.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And plenty of smoke detectors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: where did you place it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was only on the alchemiter for a few moments before I managed to get close enough to captcha then grist widget it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like I said, a few months off my life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So you guys don't make it by accident, the code is goiYJ5Lb</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a66ac">CSP: GoT AnythinG NeaT SO FaR</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have found 3 very interesting codes from ANDing the code for a captcha card.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 11111110, the Captcha Block... its a block that acts like a captcha card... it might have more features, but yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 01111111, the captcha card remover... it deletes a captcha card.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I have the Captcharoid code here somewhere...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a66ac">CSP: NeaT</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 01110010</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a66ac">CSP: WhaT DoeS ThE CaptchroiD DO</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It takes a picture of an item and prints out a card with a ghost image.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Go and test it by taking a picture of a gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, the code is unintelegible, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a66ac">CSP: i Don'T ThinK That'D BE a GooD IdeA</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've tried it, I can't read the code for the gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like a pumpkin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...which I've lost again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you have an intellibeam laerstation?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would say I only have 1/100th of that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that was AFTER farming imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And after spending the first thousand... so I could get a Jumper Extension.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Get ready, that usually means a boss is coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I haven't been able to collect the grist from the ogres that have come.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, heres a tip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 00111101 Makes a shunt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It costs 10 build grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, you could just deploy it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I have to test the shunt code in a shunt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Inserting a shunt code adds more slots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a66ac">CSP: UnfortunatelY MY CaptchaloguE ModuS Doesn'T RelY ON SpacE BuT RatheR TimE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was refering to the Jumper Block Extension, which normally has 8 slots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Adding one of these turns it to 16 slots... 15 usable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because of the fact that the Shunt code is taking up one spot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, at least it isn't useless and adds one!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...like the code for the captcha card.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I had to scale it down immensely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need a magnafying glass to read the codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: wait, how do you not have that much by now? are you still unable to strife bigger underlings for lots of grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, you should install gristtorrent to have access to the session's collective grist gutter, that'd help too</span><br />

<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: the windows too</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: does it look recently abandoned? if not, it may be ruins or a dungeon instead of a village</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: bluh, food alchemy fetch quests &gt;_&gt; they're running low on food, and need me to make more from what hasn't become a foodsickle already</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: Okay something's not right. It looks like no one's used it in a while, but there's still like...all this normal stuff out? Food, random farming implements...</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: Are those my bedsheets?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: Yeah there's no one in this place at all. No monsters, no Consorts, nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: just a bunch of old stuff and some mirrors in the houses</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: Well that was creepy</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: There was this old well in the center</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: Hmmm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: and in one of the houses there was a bucket with a note nearby</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: saying they needed to take it to the well before *something* happened</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: apparently stocking up</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: So I put it in the well and I think something in the mirror moved</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: There's nothing there</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: but it's like</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: I don't know</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: Turns out there were some boondollars in a nearby chest, so I guess it was a quest? But there is seriously no one around me.</span><br />
