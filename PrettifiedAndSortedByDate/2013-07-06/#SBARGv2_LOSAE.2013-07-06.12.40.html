<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The nicer part of me wants to say it was to get her to stay put and not risk herself unnecessarily</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#1815ea">[CEQ]</span>  waves at FS, and the approaching MA. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's cause you guys are so nice that I can play the jackass sometimes...Have to, I'd like to think, but maybe want to a little.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Thanks. And sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">PMA: Yo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Annnnnyway, that's enough waxing. Sup Krin.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  two-finger salute and a grin. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Not too much, no. We just arrived, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *glides over to the group proper* Anyfin we need t'know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: good question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  waves at AG --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *grins and waves at Wolf*</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alright, everyone's here, so general briefing time, yuppers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Alrighty</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is standing around nearby --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sogBot <span style="color:#955311">[CSB]</span>  moves from EQ's jacket pocket to shoulder. More view, that way. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You can probably see the kinda landscape we're dealin' with from here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks out at all the things --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  gestures to the dark brown earth bisected every so often by rivers of lava or towering mountains. More common, almost strangely so, the factories, regularly situated along the lava flows or at the bases of volcanos. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: hm, indeed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Better not try to get a tan, you'll just shrivel up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like I said, the lava's not insanely hot to the degree that we'll die from close contact, but it's got some weird properties all its own, not all of which I admit to understanding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: 'Course Krin's right, it's still pretty hot. Light clothes'll probably be best... long as you're not walkin' around in a suit of armor you'll probably be alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What properties have you noted?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just from cursory examination it's got a strange kind of magic feel to it...Magic lava? Yeah as if it weren't bad enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just bein' lava, y'know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: magic lava... </span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Would it melt one of the pots from the water dungeon if someone collected a sample of it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Y'know, hypothetically?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably, ehehe. It's pretty cool but its still a pot, and its still lava</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Seems like it smothers other magic, fizzles it out. Highlander, ether edition. The effect varies; these rivers only have it in small amounts, the likes of which can be overcome with enough raw magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But the stuff in the volcanos says fuck that noise and om-noms that shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *hums thoughtfully to herself* So any magic we have will be negated?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: On contact.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... the Fire Tablet would not let me swim through lava like that one part of the Oni Island level. good to know</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It doesn't make like an anti-magic field but trying to use magic or anything of the supernatural like on it, doesn't take. The stuff sizzles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah that's the idea Kimura. Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, better to know about it in advance and be careful ;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: ...yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((inb4 there's Ice Flowers that let you skate on it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT gameMaster [CGM]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If you throw stuff at lava, it tends to just bounce off anyway, 's a lot like taffy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Right. So try not to fall in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, more then you would, I mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  snickers. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((afk lunch, "==&gt;" autopilot on))</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: alrighty...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Does it negate magic that's being applied to a person when a person is touching it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And not applying the magic to it directly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: ... Do you honestly want to try it out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Yes/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... I'd rather you not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But science...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like I said it's got its own magical thing going on that smothers others, and like Hannah said I just went under the assumption it does because I'd rather not accidently melt your hand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Iron's got a melting point of higher than lava's temperature, though… I think...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: ...does this happen to include aspect powers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We're going to find out, FS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: guys, that doesn't sound like a good idea at all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's what I test it it with, I think. I've been running under the assumption that Chromagia's a Heart ability, and it smothered those, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'd just really suggest not going into the lava.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  :| --</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's okay, I have many health items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Where are we even going?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Violation of Common Sense. Gotta love it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Our destination is that area right over yonder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Common what now? And good. Anyfin else, or can we go?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  points at a mountain in the not-so-distant distance, a sizable mechanical structure seemingly built into its base. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((back. speedran the kitchen, leftovers are a wonderful thing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((woot))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think that's all. I got a buncha spare water if anyone needs, the lava's funky magic-eatting lava, don't fall into it. Seem like the main points to me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  nods, walking on ahead. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... I don't wanna die.</span><br />
