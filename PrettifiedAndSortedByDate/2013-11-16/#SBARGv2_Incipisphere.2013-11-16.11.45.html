[12:21:57] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't know I mean</span><br />
[12:22:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It /could/ be my casual ribing of John as Kira thanks to his latest weapon</span><br />
[12:22:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But that's obviously a joke and getting worried over it would be exceedingly silly</span><br />

[12:32:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually, shouldn't the Magicant /itself/ be safe enough for the pups? considering you can't port in, only go through existing entrances (or my Door Station, which I need to remember to captcha tonight)</span><br />
[12:33:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: According to turningpoint, Chronos can't go to earth.</span><br />
[12:35:16] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Also according to that, he expects that to be temporary. So he's still got some plan or other for trying to get around it.</span><br />
[12:35:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[12:35:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then Seth screwed over that plan.</span><br />

[12:37:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But see, its the safest place they could be, is what I'm trying to say.</span><br />
[12:37:09] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But what do I know.</span><br />
[12:37:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...If we don't win there's a good chance there won't /be/ a safe place.</span><br />
[12:38:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
[12:38:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But it /will/ prevent a hostage situation.</span><br />
[12:39:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe.</span><br />
[12:39:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This isn't a fight we can lose. It's as simple as that.</span><br />
[12:40:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[12:40:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, tonight, if no one's heading to earth to hide, I'll send Crux and Kutone into the Magicant and then captcha the door behind them.</span><br />

[06:31:34] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As a Knight of Hope you tend to "weaponize" your Hope towards achieving your goals. You seem to have a boundless enthusiasm but you don't seem to lend Hope to others. Often your actions leave othe rplayers irked but they are always done with the best intentions in mind.  Σ</span><br />
[06:32:02] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Basically you provide Hope for yourself and use it to move forward but can't do the same for others. Σ</span><br />

[06:33:51] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but it is. Advice is not the same as Hope though they can be linked if you do so with the intent to provide more options or good feelings. Σ</span><br />
