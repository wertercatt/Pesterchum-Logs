[09:37:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- athensHeroine <span style="color:#00aefe">[AH]</span> began messaging frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> at 21:37 --</span><br />
[09:37:19] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: So.</span><br />
[09:37:27] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: What do you wish to know?</span><br />
[09:37:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Is it a psychic link, or a transformation?</span><br />
[09:38:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I /really/ hope its the second.</span><br />
[09:38:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: but knowing my luck its likely the first</span><br />
[09:38:54] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Oh, simple: Just take out one AI in the bot, and replace it with another of a simmilar sort.</span><br />
[09:39:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...oh</span><br />
[09:39:06] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Easy.</span><br />
[09:39:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...what is you relation to it?</span><br />
[09:39:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It said that you would never say anything about it</span><br />
[09:39:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: or something like that</span><br />
[09:39:57] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I find it silly that neman chose SB out of everything, but still.</span><br />
[09:39:58] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Oh</span><br />
[09:40:15] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Nemean is my helper bot. One of my helper bots.</span><br />
[09:40:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Then I trapped his/her/its ass in a card and time locked it</span><br />
[09:40:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: oh</span><br />
[09:40:47] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I suggest you don't do that, by the way.</span><br />
[09:41:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: don't do what?</span><br />
[09:41:13] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: The locking it in place thing.</span><br />
[09:41:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its pretty much /frozen in time/</span><br />
[09:41:36] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Yeah. It won't like it.</span><br />
[09:41:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: How?</span><br />
[09:41:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It won't sense anything until the timelock is released</span><br />
[09:41:59] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: It tends to be jumpy, and keeps its eye on the clock.</span><br />
[09:42:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: its going to be instantanious to it</span><br />
[09:42:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: oh</span><br />
[09:42:22] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Once it realizes that time has passed without it defeting something...</span><br />
[09:42:45] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Well, it wont be happy, but its not harmful.</span><br />
[09:42:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: its gonna blow up?</span><br />
[09:42:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: it threatened to do that</span><br />
[09:42:55] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: In Sogbots body, that is.</span><br />
[09:43:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...wait, if nemean is in /here/</span><br />
[09:43:21] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I'm not sure if Sogbot can self distruct. I did not build it, so I wouldnt know.</span><br />
[09:43:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: then... where is Sog?</span><br />
[09:44:09] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Physically, somewhere in space, residing in a computer.</span><br />
[09:44:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: hmm...</span><br />
[09:44:29] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: She's been causing me trouble, on my blog, though.</span><br />
[09:45:16] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I didnt think that it would still be able to access other computers, oh well.</span><br />
[09:45:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...what.</span><br />
[09:45:48] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: It's an AI in a computer connected to the weird-internet thing here.</span><br />
[09:45:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: nono, I mean</span><br />
[09:46:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: why would you say sog is causing you trouble?</span><br />
[09:46:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...and now my brain is assuming the worst.</span><br />
[09:46:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: great.</span><br />
[09:47:24] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: -Because its putting all its effort into delaying some of my projects. Also, depending on what you may be thinking, your brain might be right. I kinda doubt it, though.</span><br />
[09:48:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I am currently under the belief that you have kidnapped Sogbot and Hannah because they delve too much into your business.</span><br />
[09:49:18] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Psh, why would I need that robot? Or nemean, for that matter? I can build my own, and SB is not all that special.</span><br />
[09:49:32] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: It can't even really fight all that well. 'Kinda useless.</span><br />
[09:49:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Except SB's body would be perfect for lulling us into a false sense of security.</span><br />
[09:50:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: While the /real/ sog posed as you just now on your blog to warn us.</span><br />
[09:50:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: -That was not me.</span><br />
[09:50:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, Hannahs blog.</span><br />
[09:50:40] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: That was the pest, posting that.</span><br />
[09:50:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But why would he hide?</span><br />
[09:50:54] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: It still counts a mod for that blog, mind you.</span><br />
[09:51:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: This all seems /rather/ suspicious</span><br />
[09:51:13] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Nemean?</span><br />
[09:51:19] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Simple.</span><br />
[09:51:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And right now, you are likely trying to wipe out all traces of Sog.</span><br />
[09:52:13] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: You don't fully trust me or what I say, so I doubt you would have trusted my own bots.</span><br />
[09:52:34] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: -Cant argue about that last bit.</span><br />
[09:53:35] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: It's causing me trouble, its not in use, nor will it be used in a while... I should reasonably get rid of the thing.</span><br />
[09:53:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I believe that posting this log would be a violation of our agreement.</span><br />
[09:54:02] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Mhm ~♫</span><br />
[09:54:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Of course, you have likely used this time to place traps all around.</span><br />
[09:55:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: In locations such as the <span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafé</span>.</span><br />
[09:55:08] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Oh, of course not.</span><br />
[09:55:27] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I'm not that desprite to attack you all.</span><br />
[09:55:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[09:55:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Release Sog.</span><br />
[09:55:56] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I'm happilly working on my projects in a veil labrotory, thank you very much!</span><br />
[09:56:12] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Or?</span><br />
[09:56:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Or you shall learn the true meaning of Mutual assured destruction.</span><br />
[09:57:33] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Heh... I like the way you think, player. Very nice.</span><br />
[09:57:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: and I won't even bother with the small stuff like dice.</span><br />
[09:58:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: mhm, mhm...  Don't think I'm unaware exactly how powerful you players are.</span><br />
[09:58:41] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: But anyways: The problem.</span><br />
[09:59:22] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I was not lying when I said that the computer with sogbot is somewhere in space right now.</span><br />
[09:59:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[09:59:39] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I'm not sure exactly where, and even then: She won't be of much use.</span><br />
[09:59:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And what of Hannah?</span><br />
[10:00:04] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Poor bot is missing a couple of memory logs...</span><br />
[10:00:11] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Her...</span><br />
[10:00:39] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I'm not in liberty to speak of. She is MIA.</span><br />
[10:01:10] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: -And you don't beleive that, do you?</span><br />
[10:01:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I believe my friends are thinking that I am being highly suspicious right now.</span><br />
[10:02:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What with all the sweat and the fact that I am hiding the screens on them.</span><br />
[10:02:38] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Oh, please. Tell them that athena is being spooky or something, and tell them that nemean is my AI or something.</span><br />
[10:02:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, the screens on my shades.</span><br />
[10:02:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...And why would I do that?</span><br />
[10:02:59] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: I'm letting you go through a loophole, here, you realize.</span><br />
[10:03:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Why would I tell them anything at all?</span><br />
[10:03:31] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Because you are highly suspicious of me, and reasonably so.</span><br />
[10:03:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Why would I make my friends follow my path?</span><br />
[10:04:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I am not the one to be getting in the way of the paths they choose to make.</span><br />
[10:04:53] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Because that path is tough, yet easier to travel with others. You don't have to keep everything bottled up.</span><br />
[10:05:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'll just state that DT made me play SCP Containment Breach, and that I didn't want any distractions.</span><br />
[10:05:21] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Gosh, I would have thought the game would have hammered that lesson into your skull already.</span><br />
[10:05:30] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Heh...</span><br />
[10:05:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I am giving you a chance, athena.</span><br />
[10:06:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Fool me once, shame on you.</span><br />
[10:06:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Fool me twice... lets not even mention that.</span><br />
[10:06:36] <span style="color:#00aefe">AH: Indeed.</span><br />
[10:06:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Good luck athena.</span><br />
[10:06:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I hope we can still be friends.</span><br />
