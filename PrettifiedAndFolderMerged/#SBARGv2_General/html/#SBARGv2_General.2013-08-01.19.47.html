<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and i just remembered now</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: so there are these two girls and they live in this poor world where everything's old and broken down etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and one night a... train? phone booth? idek comes and they get in it and they're transported into this high tech magic future place thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: they were very adamant about making it to the transporter thing on time</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: there's a bunch of other kids and stuff there as well, some giddy and knowing, some disoriented, and it's a night of fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: but come morning, they get back in and the younger girl, she wakes up and finds her older sister missing</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and she goes to her mom and asks her where she is, and the mom replies with "what sister? you're an only child"</span><br />

<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: sorry she was actually a middle child i believe</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: all three go in, and the cycle repeats, and then the older sister's back, but no little brother</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and it keeps /happening/</span><br />

<span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and there's something sinister about the new world they get transported in, and... that's where I can't remember anymore.</span><br />
