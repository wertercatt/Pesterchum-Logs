<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, what do you need in the jumperblock to load the sd card?</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And rip victory straight out of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: God no</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: In 24 hours maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably more</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: (Um, I'm not the wolf-boy, I'm... I guess I'm his guide now, since HE'S the wolfsprite?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now, everybody buckle your pants, and start whipping up the most badass shit you can think of</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ( oh, my bad then. )</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: ((*Kimurasprite has stopped spazzing the fuck out and is now asleep, but not in a Prospit way*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: Hmm... I guess I'll wait and see when he wakes up, if he's got any ideas for what to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: And we can't forget about all the other stuff. The glitches haven't stopped being a thing that exists, after all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Glitch might never have existed, if Chronos was behind it all, I guess that battery was to destroy the gates</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: Well, I'm looking out from the dwelling spire right now, and there's still glowing green Corrupted Cursed Zones out there, so even if the glitch ruse was a, uh, "distaction", there's still a remaining effect of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then I guess we'll have to fix it. Because the guardian doesn't exist now, we're on our own, if anybody can handle that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nobody to look for now, nobody to fix this, it's on our backs now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: HE WilL PaY</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: Okay... First thing we need is inter-land transport. And I know Kimura just finished levelling up the Skaian Portal brush technique to make permanent Gates...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: Once he wakes up, I'll see if he's up to re-linking the lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's a nexus of transportalizers on most planets, hook yourself up if you can, it'll make things easier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: Oh, that works even better. Brush Portals for some land links, transportalizers for everything else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's rig ourself up an army.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: ((But seriously though, if the "Guardian" was planning this twist from the beginning... she's one hell of a GM to be able to lead us on for so long with no one guessing O_O))</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ((I had an idea when this was posted <a href='http://sbargv2.tumblr.com/post/51614489391/'>http://sbargv2.tumblr.com/post/51614489391/</a>  but holy shit no i was not prepared for that))</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: ((what about the consorts and carapaces? think they're in on it too?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((they probably don't know about all this))</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ((there's always a possiblity, but i don't think so))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((also, I'm IC-ly AWOL from the memo))</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#339966">CURRENT destitutePilot [CDP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: w e l p</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: ((IC-ly, I'm having a mental metacrisis from merging with Ammy, so "I" won't be back online until tomorrow))</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: ((so Issun's doing all the talking for me for a bit, and probably also gonna make a short v2journal post as him))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((I don't even know when I'm coming back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: what the evERLIVING FUCK HAPPENED</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: Not completely dead. Ammy made it back with 1 HP and survived long enough for Kimura to prototype to save her.</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: I'm hoping the other sprites fared better...</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">FIJ2: There. I can't do much else right now, so I borrowed Kimura's Bubblr thing and let off some steam... <a href='http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51788223187/losac-part-fuck-you-kamigami'>http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51788223187/losac-part-fuck-you-kamigami</a></span><br />
