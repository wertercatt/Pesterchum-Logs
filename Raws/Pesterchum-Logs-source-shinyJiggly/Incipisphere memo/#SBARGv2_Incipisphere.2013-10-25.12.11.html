<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's play this game, then. Why would you want to do something like that?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I want to go down as someone who /actually/ knew how to calculate codes for punch card alchemy instead of getting a gravestone with "Idot" written on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Honestly I don't think there's all that much to be explored as far as alchemy is concerned, beyond seeing what something might make with another thing, or some shit like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Recipe Modus states that the Hard-Boiled Fedora is a Potted Plant &amp;&amp; Dream Bubbles || Matriorb.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cz!Z!l!k and CuPA8LnQ respectively.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So you're saying you're trying to figure out how to get the codes for the other two things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: And what exactly do you have to benefit from this, other than being known as the guy that messed around with alchemy a lot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a perfect process, But I can narrow it down to say, 2^18 items so far for what /might/ be the code for Dream Bubbles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: That doesn't answer my question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I can get the code for the Matriorb, I could potentially get the code for other items that may be more importaint to us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: See, this would be more credible if you actually had something that everyone could agree would be a good idea to figure out how to get without having obtained the code in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You had such a good streak of being semi-cool, too. Like last night was actually pretty great.</span><br />
