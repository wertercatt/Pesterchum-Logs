<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: and to think i'm still treating them like persons</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Sorry to hear, AE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: because you'd rather be the better person...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: because he doesn't want to pay for a box to preserve a far more costly drawing tablet from getting its cable broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i'm not necessarily a good person if i take everyone's shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: that only makes me the septic pit cleaner</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: it just doesn't work like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: and in the event that they DO end up successful, they sure as hell won't share that success with you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: am i in the ballpark on that AE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: yes</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: But if they can afford the kid to play one, couldn't they afford for them to play one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it's a figure of speech, EP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Oh :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there probably aren't any literal violins involved here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: no literal</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: seriously?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: sure, they have their degrees in art and archaeology, but they want me to succeed even more</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Well, I think most parents are like that to some degree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Like, they want their children to do well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Better than them, even.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: but this is really shitty of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: yeah, but forcing to the point of resentment is bad parenting</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i earned some of the best fucking grades in the japanese language courses, and I received not a word of thanks</span><br />

<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: my parents are just two crazy fucks with little appreciation for whatever i do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Europeon parents do it too, stereotypically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Most families who are upper class, anyway.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: I mean, I'm still sure they still care, even if it doesn't feel like they do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: they would never ever even shout at me</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: because they're great parents</span><br />

<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: they treat it like it's nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: they don't know how much I've toiled</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: but I've given up a long time ago already</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Maybe they do notice, but they just don't say anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: then they're psychopaths</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Well, it could be like, that they don't feel that they need to give recognition?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: they don't feel anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: aside from successboners</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: You could talk it out with them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CEP: Talk about how you feel about them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: they don't take me seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: plus, they'll just think i'm up to something</span><br />
