[03:17] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  it's my fetch modus, based on the interface of Sword Art Online --</span><br />

[03:22] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Wait no fuck</span><br />
[03:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...nothing happened. I guess Rejuvenation is an incompatible repair format or something...</span><br />

[03:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's odd. normally when a brush technique fizzles, the thing just stays as-is.</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Normally your not trying to fix complex digital items</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Probly</span><br />

[03:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ((I bookmarked that so that when Kimura tries things I know whats going on))</span><br />
[03:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Kimura rember the game is called Sbarg</span><br />

[03:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like, details y'know?</span><br />
[03:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: And I dont think the recoder would work on the sorce code, unless he digitlized into the Session's grid</span><br />
[03:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey, PK could you let me know the code for that thing?</span><br />
[03:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok... time to see if all that practice playing Tron 2.0's lightcycle mode pays off... wait, fuck, Legacy-class cycles are omnidirectional. oh well, should still be able to do it</span><br />

[03:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  one of them seems desigined for Kimura's sprite bodytype --</span><br />
