<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I would have happilly smacked some sense into everyone there, but I myself was away, working on a project. I had no idea you were being that stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2ed400">CURRENT jabberGhost [CJG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Oh hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I kind of don't know many people!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Mind introducing yourselves?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I love meeting people and this could finally be...a lot of cool new people to meet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Welcome to Brad's house of sarcasm. How may I take your order?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Heheh. Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I haven't said that in... ages.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Congrats AE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But yeah, uh... who exactly are you, JG? Are you another alien, or...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#941894">CURRENT moroseTerminator [CMT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: From what I could tell, another player that we just never saw much of at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Well, it depends from what perspective, but i'm pretty sure in a human dominant session, the answer is no!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Which is to say yes, but i'm human.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, okay then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... Okay then. Noted. You were from a session, eh? What was/is your classpect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I was the prince of space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Though i'd rather not go into the details of that role.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I don't think i really lived up to the standards of my role very well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But that's neither here nor there since i didn't spend all too much time on my planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#6507ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hopefully you're noτ as egoτisτical as τhe space players I've meτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, the prince class tends to be a major pain in the butt. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Says the Prince of Time. :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Only to myself it seems!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's why I'm saying it: it's a challenge to deal with the expectations. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Though i met lots and lots of people!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But i try not to judge people based on the stupid roles the game gave them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's good to hear. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I feel mine was mismatched and completely unfair!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But i'm not here to complain. </span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: =B</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Not when i'm here making such a freaking good first impression i'm sure..</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Heh heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So tell me about you guys!</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'd say mine fits. Fucking Knight of Void. I'm incredibly good at making fights out of nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'm depressed as hell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: You can call me Kaτ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm addicted to suicide. Name's Brad, as mentioned before. Call me whatever the fuck you like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: My name is Niki, I'm pretty much the expert on time shenanigans around here.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: =[ Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Uh, nice to meet you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Time shenanigans sound pretty fun. They make my head spin a lot though, so it's cool you're so good at them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I guess maybe that's a part of being a space player maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I don't know, my role was messed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: An aspect of creation put with a class of destruction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Maybe paradox space didn't enjoy the mish mash and that's why all the stuff that happened happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You can just call me EQ or Hannah, I don't really mind which. I try to be the voice of logic around here. Try is the keyword. Classpect, I'd rather not share at the moment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Hannah is the only one of us who doesn't fuck up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Nope. I just fuck up in different ways than you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So it seems that on the level, there was a lot of fucking up!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: What happened in the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: you fuck up in...τhe leasτ caτasτrophic waτ, usually?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: idek anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: It was so confusing and a lot of deaths and i have to admit i couldn't piece it all together much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I think i mentioned this before, but i spent most of the session being dead. =|</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Ha. Sounds like my kinda guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: TT, I fuck up physically. You will never see me dodge anything, and my hand-eye coordination is the worst. Mentally, I at least can think things through- Woah what. Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I mean, i was fine. I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: How does that work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But i was there and no-one could see me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: weird. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I have no idea. I got killed, and i mean like actual dead dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And i spent most of my time like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Interesting...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Careful what you wish for i guess!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how did you come back though? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Hm... before I say anything about myself, do any of you (aside from JG of course) know who I am, even?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not really? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I was brought back by a friend who was manipulated by another friend of mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: She had died and went god tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Life player.</span><br />
