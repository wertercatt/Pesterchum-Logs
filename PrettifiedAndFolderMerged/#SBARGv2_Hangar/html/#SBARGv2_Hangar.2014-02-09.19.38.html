[08:03:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we know the lunar whale isn't going to fit in here.</span><br />
[08:03:38] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i can move my tv setup in there</span><br />

[08:04:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I could link the FTL drive in my ship to the one here to boost our speed.</span><br />
[08:05:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: would it be possible to have FL captcha the Whale, and uncaptcha it when we need it?</span><br />

[08:05:53] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont trust him with it</span><br />
[08:06:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably a good idea. ➜</span><br />
[08:06:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk. just suggested FL since I know Filesystem Modus has very generous space limits, but if Convoy can handle it, go ahead</span><br />
[08:06:52] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill get everything moved over to the firefly first though</span><br />
[08:07:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: only because Filesystem bumps up the ram as you add more cards.</span><br />
[08:07:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then I ended up hitting the max number of cards filesystem supports which is a few billion.</span><br />

[08:09:38] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: still</span><br />
[08:09:43] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill take it for my own use</span><br />
[08:10:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Got it.</span><br />
[08:10:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...how did you load that many captchacards in your  modus in the first place??? ➜</span><br />
[08:10:21] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ill be keeping my setup in the whale until i get some kind of confirmation that we are going with the firefly</span><br />
[08:10:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: chronic kleptomania, I think it was</span><br />
[08:11:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I ended up spamming creation of captchablocks (sets of 64 cards) in order to captcha Ashsprites' present so I could hide it.</span><br />
[08:12:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then I did it again to store the battleships.</span><br />
[08:13:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay then. ➜</span><br />
[08:13:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ended up using a ton of artifact grist in the process.</span><br />
[08:14:13] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...well unless theres something else to discuss im heading home</span><br />
[08:14:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (I am so glad captchacards can be made from /any/ type of grist.)</span><br />

[08:15:17] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...why do you want to?</span><br />

[08:17:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I was smart at anything, it was using the alchemy system we can no longer access.</span><br />
[08:17:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well all be sharing a ship anyway, most likely</span><br />
[08:18:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I could have the AU Machine load the code for our session so I could learn more recipes... but it wouldn't help for most of the items.</span><br />
[08:18:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no i mean</span><br />
[08:18:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since most of the items have magic and shit preventing them from being replicated.</span><br />
[08:18:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and I'm rambling.</span><br />
[08:18:51] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...if you want to hang out with him, probably best to wait till were on the ship</span><br />
[08:19:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay true.</span><br />
[08:19:44] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just because its less of a headache for everyone</span><br />

[08:20:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[08:20:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe we should see him play qwop</span><br />

[08:22:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean like</span><br />
[08:22:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why that specific thing</span><br />
[08:24:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its not fun to go into a random AU where it forces you into a non bipedial form, okay?</span><br />
