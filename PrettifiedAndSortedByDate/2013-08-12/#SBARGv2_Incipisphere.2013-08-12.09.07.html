[09:22:03] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: I know a lot of things, and if you wanna tell me what you're glubbing aboat, I'll know even more.</span><br />
[09:33:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay that is the last time I read Kid Radd before going to sleep again.</span><br />
[09:33:26] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: You are a strange and confusing person sometimes.</span><br />
[09:34:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, maybe...</span><br />
[09:34:54] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Dude, just… don't think about shit too hard. It'll give you a headache and an existential crisis.</span><br />
[09:35:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wind Fish.</span><br />
[09:35:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah.</span><br />

[09:35:38] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Eat a fuckin' cookie or something. 'S what I do. Who the fuck cares what's up and what's real-- I have a delicious fucking cookie, and I can't affect the realness of anything, but as long as imaginary cookies are imaginarily delicious, I am imaginarily happy.</span><br />
[09:35:53] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: I may have just become inured to shit, but, y'know.</span><br />
[09:35:55] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: /Cookies/.</span><br />
[09:36:06] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: … oh my god my entire life philosophy is based around cookies.</span><br />
[09:36:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Maybe thats why you can hear them and I can't.</span><br />
[09:37:09] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: … 'Cause I'm a Void Player?</span><br />
[09:37:22] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Or because I just don't give a shit anymore?</span><br />
[09:37:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, because you don't worry.</span><br />
[09:37:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that might be a good thing.</span><br />
[09:38:01] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: I have more important things to worry about. Even if they en't really-truly "real", monsters /hurt/ when they bite ya.</span><br />
[09:38:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That isn't what I was concerned about.</span><br />
[09:38:31] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: So since I don't give a fuck about reality existing anymore, I can focus on just actin' like everything's real. And eating cookies. 's loads easier that way.</span><br />
[09:38:50] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: FL. Can you do anything to change it?</span><br />
[09:39:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No.</span><br />
[09:39:10] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: 'xactly. So what's it matter?</span><br />
[09:39:27] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: You think your life's on a limited span, damn well try to live it or have it written /good/.</span><br />
[09:39:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
[09:39:57] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: As in, no curlin' up into a ball and having a mental breakdown, because… well, fuck if it matters, really.</span><br />
[09:40:02] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: We're either us or we en't.</span><br />
[09:40:44] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Admittedly, if we en't, the aliens are probably horrible fucking sadists who get off to our tears, but, y'know.</span><br />
[09:40:50] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: What can we do~? :D</span><br />
[09:40:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The dilemma of Koholint...</span><br />
[09:40:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
[09:41:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I suppose if the wind fish wakes up... eventually... he will sleep again.</span><br />
[09:41:48] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Just trust in somethin' you believe in.</span><br />
[09:42:00] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Everything has to sleep -.- Suuucks.</span><br />
[09:42:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You don't get the exact reference I'm using but thats alright.</span><br />
[09:42:49] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: And remember what I said-- 's not like Alanna just fades away when I'm not looking at her in Hotel. She's just… doing shit in Hotel. And I dunno what, but I don't need to.</span><br />
[09:42:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah.</span><br />
[09:42:59] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Uh… wind fish… dreams up a world, I'm guessin'?</span><br />
[09:43:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
[09:43:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You ever play Link's Awakening?</span><br />
[09:43:27] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Nope. Never heard of it.</span><br />
[09:43:36] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Not a gamer.</span><br />
[09:43:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You should play that, and read Kid Radd.</span><br />
[09:43:49] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Saw The Matrix, though.</span><br />
[09:43:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Both kinda go on about what I'm thinking</span><br />
[09:44:09] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: And a buncha books that were as fuckin' meta as this shit might be getting -.- The Great Good Thing, for instance.</span><br />
[09:44:20] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Coolio. I'm… pretty sure I get what you're thinkin', yo.</span><br />
[09:44:26] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: I just stopped caring /ages/ ago.</span><br />
[09:45:36] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: … it'll be okay, somehow.</span><br />

[09:51:26] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: One represented anger, jealousy, hatred, and whatnot. One represented compassion.</span><br />
[09:51:26] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... I see.</span><br />
[09:51:26] <span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Envy had to make The Choice and feed one of the wolves to choose his path.</span><br />
