<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 VEIL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  crashes into a meteor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright... now to pick up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks watch --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...7 pads.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actuall,y make that 14, as I need to put them in the room...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Is RS there? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  begins to pry one of the transportalizers off of the floor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Come on...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets see, which wire do I cut...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#970025">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater's <span style="color:#970025">[CRS'S]</span>  red mech comes to rest outside the meteor, and the cockpit opens up to let him hop out and onto the thing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  deploys a pair of anchors to keep it steady before moving on --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has managed to collect a few transportalizers. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Mind if I take a look at one of those?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  hands one over. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  capchalogues the thing, taking a look at the back of the card. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Alright this should work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the backs of two, and attaches the wires. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  then puts the wires back together. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  heads back out to retrieve something from the mech... A odd, hefty-looking combination between an anvil and a computer. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  plugs it into an unused outlet, not question how or whythis place has electricity, and gets to work typing up something. After a moment a slot opens, and he inserts the card --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I got... yep, thats 14.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now to set up the room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads to a secluded room on the meteor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Where the hell are you getting all these ports</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This, there, all over the place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda broke a few walls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: What's even in this place...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No Idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I found a few broken tubes, but thats about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Broken...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Tubes...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No slime though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or liquid of any type,</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...Okay. Protip: I don't know how many others connect to these Transportalizors</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: And I'd prefer not to deal with anythingy latching onto the connections so my not-so-professional opinion is we should leave those things here. Gimme a sec over here... I got the code, and a technosmithy station all set up, so it'll just be a little before I get enough grist to make enough for our needs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  pulls out a hammer and smashes on the anvil surface, code-bits scattering from the impact --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm actually making new links using the internal systems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  links another two transportalizers. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: It's the old one's I'm worried about...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I tested that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They just don't work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is no signal for the quantum tunneling to connect to, so It just doesn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: So the signal's changed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know what happens when you can't send an email?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It bounces back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its kinda like the same thing with the transportalizers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: So you changed their address, basically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
