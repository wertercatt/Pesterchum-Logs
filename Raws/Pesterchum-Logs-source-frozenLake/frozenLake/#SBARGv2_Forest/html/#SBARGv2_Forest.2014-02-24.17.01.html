[05:08:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  enters the forest, sniffing around for FL... or apparently a shapeshifting snake --</span><br />

[05:15:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  spots "himself", and walks over in confusion --</span><br />

[05:15:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT transformingSerpent <span style="color:#9acd32">[CTS]</span>  is... sleeping pretty heavily. --</span><br />
[05:16:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... this is who FL was talking about...</span><br />
[05:23:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  pulls out the Lucky Mallet, sighing... "FL, what is /with/ you and your luck?" --</span><br />
[05:23:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrinks himself and flies into TS' mouth --</span><br />
[05:24:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks looking up at the new visitor. --</span><br />
[05:24:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ......AND I was right.</span><br />
[05:25:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could you get us out fast? Before it starts burning away at you?</span><br />
[05:25:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  isn't even touching anything that looks acidic --</span><br />
[05:25:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right, let's go.</span><br />
[05:26:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Vine-grabs FL onto him and flies out --</span><br />

[05:27:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...figures.</span><br />
[05:27:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Maybe we should think with, I don't know... /PORTALS/?!</span><br />
[05:28:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks around... assuming they're in the mouth and the transformation is internal as well as external, there should be a uvula to-- welp, that too. --</span><br />
[05:28:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of portals them outside &gt;_&gt; --</span><br />

[05:30:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unshrinks once outside, letting FL assume the position of "on top of his hat" since that's probably safest at this point --</span><br />
[05:31:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT transformingSerpent <span style="color:#9acd32">[CTS]</span>  blinks at Kimura. --</span><br />
[05:31:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just glaring. --</span><br />

[05:34:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he's only that small because he had a moment of Wheatley Tier stupidity... plus I forgot to never trust X-Nauts.</span><br />
[05:34:35] <span style="color:#9acd32">CTS: ...then again, maybe it be bezt I don't make thingz any worze.</span><br />
[05:34:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT transformingSerpent <span style="color:#9acd32">[CTS]</span>  flees --</span><br />

[05:36:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is expanding back to normal. --</span><br />
[05:37:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  backs off as soon as he notices FL getting bigger, slipping him onto the ground --</span><br />
[05:37:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks, back to normal. --</span><br />
[05:37:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh sure, /now/ it wears off.</span><br />
[05:38:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...just be glad, for his sake as well as yours, it didn't wear off inside him.</span><br />
[05:38:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly mine, considering he could have just slipped back to his natural form.</span><br />
[05:39:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  captchas the Jet wings, switching clothes with the modus. --</span><br />
[05:39:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...thaaanks for putting that image of a python eating a human whole back in my brain :/</span><br />
