<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You are so friendly today I swear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: speaking of Amy, how far through the bracket did you guys reach? semi-finals, or still round 1?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Round 1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool, so the fight I would've been in (but Amy would've subbed in for) hasn't even happened yet.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...uh huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, the thing Issun portalled me away mid-sentence for yesterday... basically, the final part of the Caverns is protected by one hell of an energy shield. well, I found the generator (on the /opposite side of the land/, for some reason), but entry is blocked by one of those "four or more people must stand on this" switches you see in Partners in Time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the dungeon schedule says this week's basically full, so I'm hoping next week we can go deal with that thing so I can finally resolve my land's plot quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hurraaay! :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also good sign for you Gambit: the place has X-Naut logos all over the place, so a rematch with Crump (either at the generator or in the Caverns itself) is /highly/ likely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If not I have to be bothered to track him down myself, sooo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :P</span><br />
