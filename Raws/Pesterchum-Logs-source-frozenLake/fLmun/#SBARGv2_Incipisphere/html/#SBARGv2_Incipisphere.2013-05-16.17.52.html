<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: weird.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: also Hi FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, you know, denizens are supposed to ruin your day in general! Be a final boss for the planet, but there's no consorts to be terrified of</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: of it*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: House. Past 3rd floor. Supports Glitchmelted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: so it fell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: My consorts are legless lizards. They are adorable and very nice even if they are stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Awww!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Into the chasm off the cliff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My consorts appear to be golems, made of some kind of mixture of stone and metal and clockword on the inside</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: NV that sounds like a really megahuge, haddron collider deal of a glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No sign of the glitch though... maybe it fell with the house?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Hope so, FL. You're alright, I assume? =(</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I wouldent count on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: doubt it. corruption isn't weak enough to die from fall damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: well if it fell there's more time to get away from it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: even if it lived.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, maybe not the fall damage, but thousands of pounds of house falling apart onto it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: as if it could take damage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, glitch trail ends at the stair case.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the other problem is... what if it's not the only one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what if it doesent have a heath vitle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I don't think its up there any more...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if the health vial is a negative value?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: um</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then use healing items</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: then it glitches until it's out of combat??</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: what if, going back to the Tron 2.0 thing, what you saw was only a basic Z-Lot and not Thorne himself?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: then it dies</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey you there</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Proper use of the word glitch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: +10 points.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the real virus has got to be elsewhere, fucking shit up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: that's what happens in pokemon, at least, except with fainting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: or MMOs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was thinking of a value so high that it wraps into the negatives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: exponents?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, superhigh negitives?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also NV, thanks for reminding me. to fix any future confusion, I told Past Me to do something different in the keytoolKind weapon creation and name it "Copland" instead of "Glitch".</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: did you doom us all?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fuckin. Thank you. Proper nomenclature is always a good thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so no one thinks I'm talking about The Corruption when I'm just giving my keytool a command...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know how with binary if the first number is a 1, its negative?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Copland sounds so much more menacing</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: TN: nope. stable time loop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on a 32 bit number?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: OK good</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I'd like to think it would un-glitch as soon as it would get out of combat then</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and be crushed by your house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: =( sorry that your house got destroyed btw</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what if its combat glitches as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL, only if it's a signed var. I don't know if ~ath is like java and ONLY has signed vars, or like C++ where you can make things unsigned...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it was just the third floor and on...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we can rebuild... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Then I think something deeper is going on here, if its combat is glitched.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: if unsigned vars are a thing, presumably health vials are an unsigned int</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Is there some kind of SBURB spyware?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If not, I launch myself through the gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's usually a Doom player, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: combat glitches typically require a hard reset</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and we can't scratch, so... =(</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: and I'm a hope player, but then again, I just got a fraymotif that can fix this. probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...why can't we scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: No beat mesa</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...you sure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: anaywhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I wouldn't think so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well that only means one thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I haven't met anyone with one</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We'd need a Time hero</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: we are a scrached session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For all we know, it could be floating above the glitch mass planets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that would explain the lack of ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: someone call for a time player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles what is with you and Glitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It doesn't make any sense man</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I was just saying why we dont have a beat messa type thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I barely managed to dodge one of those a few days ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: It can only means one thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: we are a scrached session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: FL, would you track that glitch down while I fly over to your planet? What's your planet called anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well post scrach</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: DS, you may have a point. Alternia was a Scratched session and didn't have a Cardinal Movement (iirc). the Void Session... doesn't even have a Land of X and Clock Things since Dave was coming to it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm pretty sure the Alpha session only didn't have a time player because it knew that dave and the others were coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But we do have a time hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So logically a beat mesa exists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is the Land of Steam and Crossroads...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: wow, two crossroads planets?? That's odd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: a scrached univers doent have a means of scraching because it was alredy scrached</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has a large amount of trains.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: anyways I'll be heading over there posthaste</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some people just want to watch the world train.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and the ectobilogy was taken care of by our pre scrach counterparts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I'm bringing the drone downwards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, what would happen if not everything was wiped out by a scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which means... My dad was in the first Sbarg?!?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ditto*^?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I actually asked my parents... no meteor for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we may be like fedora freak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL: me either. we might just be non-ectobabby players</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: hm. Maybe they lied because they were in shock? I mean, I know of several craters around here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but anyway, what if not everything in a session was wiped out by a scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, junk data.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: eek.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: that sounds bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One of you guys had the theory this glitch might have been a player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: a reformat that skipped over a few sectors?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what if it WAS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: oh gog</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ._.;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Uhoh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thats a bit horrorfying</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...hopy shit. Thorne-Analogue is a Corrupted Pre-Scratch Player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thorne-Analogue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I was refering to how it might be like in Tron 2.0</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the bad guy was named Thorne, and he was a User who was improperly digitized and became corrupt</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see, its leaving a glitch trail, has red eyes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: I think I may know who else could be a part of it. I've been scanning my harddrives and there's a picture of a girl like me but with brighter eyes; she looks angry in all the pictures... =(</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: no his name was CLU</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and is staticy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tron 2.0 was a different show.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not the movie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: Tron 2.0 was the video game sequel, before Legacy was a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tron 2.0 =/= Tron Legacy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: oh that game</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I thought it was just a light sycle game</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: abd disc wars</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I liked Tron.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: but um.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But in reality no, it reminds me of an Anti-Spiral.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anti-Sprial had white eyes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is a pretty nightmarish thing, and I can see some comparisons</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I got a closer look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, I know.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay for one it's not a glitch it's a virus</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...do you know what the orignal image was called?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So stop spamming the glitch excuse</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, was M' from pokemon a virus, or a glitch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Missingno?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it was a glitchmon</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Something that was completely unintentional to be in there was a glitch, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa557f">CTN: Gotta go for now, orges at my door</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That was an error in the coding for removed content, not something with actual working coding like the ~ATH we saw</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: console and handheld games don't have viruses</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's definitely a virus</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: what the fuck!</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: What the hell was that thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, this thing is more like a BADEGG.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you get it, it FUCKS UP YOUR GAME.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: aaaaaah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But I'm not gonna call this thing a glitch anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yeah, it's either a Corrupted Player that may or may not be Pre-Scratch, or paradox space is not a virus-proof OS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets call this thing the Corrupt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, while the eyes were the same, I did not see a symbol.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhaτ scares me τo no end</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ///lovely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: As if I-We don't have enough to worry about...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, Super Glitch in pokemon scrambled the games ram, so maybe the glitch works?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or somebody TURNED OFF THE POWER WHEN SAVING AND RECODED THE GAME TO THIS SHIT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...are you saying... we're a corrupted save file?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm saying that thing may be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: *or in one</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: No. </span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: What we are is courrpted data, like when someone scrathes a dick or stops downloading or saving at the wrongmoment....</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its fucking up this game though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, what if someone is downloading loads of seperate files, then looses access... and all these files piece together to make a rar?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: "scratches a dick" :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: freud just tripped over an errant phallus and fell down the stairs again</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You get a bunch of working files, then a large ammount of shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think that could have happened during entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: or a torrent with missing pieces? (not that I would know about that, Comcast always had a zero-tolerance policy in our area for using BT)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#6507ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((INTERNET))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In anycase, we have these problems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((Post-Scratch Chronos set you up the bomb))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Glitch Planets, glitchplayer, glitched gates, glitch air... well, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( More like Pre-Scratch Corrupted Chronos. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((makes so much sense))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Hey, if hes in three sessions, he has a larger chance of dreaming on derspit... He could be 3 players in one! ))</span><br />
