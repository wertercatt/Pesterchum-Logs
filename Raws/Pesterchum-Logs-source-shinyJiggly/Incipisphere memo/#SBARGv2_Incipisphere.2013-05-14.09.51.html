<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What was I thinking...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was about to ask the same thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...anyway, I have a theory about all of these glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, in a session, Skaia has time to adapt when ever we enter with a prototype.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But, considering most of us entered within the same moment... Well, remember mspa on 10/25/11?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yes, the Cascade newgrounds crash...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: who could forget that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We managed to DOS Newgrounds from trying to all watch the video.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, imagine the same thing happening to skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though something tells me there's been bigger sessions out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other than the 20 of us on the gate list, I imagine we have about a hundred people in this session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All going in moments within each other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We DOSed Skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are responsible for the glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but wait a minute, I heard that Skaia was messed up even before entry</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well I think all the gliches before that didn't help</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes and Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: before entry that is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe that some of the glitchs somehow made it backwards in time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: the pre entry gliches probubly pushed it over the edge</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If Time players and meteors can time travel, what stopping glitches from doing the same thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was thinking sorta the same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#eacf00">CURRENT lunarLemonade [CLL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: a-ight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: don't look at me like that D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No time for skaia to form right, no time for the lands to spawn correctly, no time for the gates to form right...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You get the idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Sburb has all the time it wants</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: in a way</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and no time for aspects to be correctly assigned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: so maybe it's more linked to external events</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, those all normally occur retroactively due to entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: FL your forgeting something</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: most paradoxes can't even happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: no ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: no meteor sending stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes DS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it's obvious that the lack of these two things messed up a few things</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Once our planets are spawned they have always have been there... right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: unless the glitcfhes themselves influenced the way there never was any ectobiology at work</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Retroactive spawning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: oh my</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If one does not get in the session, the planet never spawns.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((this is so silly))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: also I remember the gardean mentioning that our univers was never suposed to have a session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: they don't spawn retroactively, but once the lands are made, on the lands themselves it is as if they were always there</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which would explain the lack of ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: if a Time player goes back to before a certain player entered, their land won't be there until they actually do enter</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, like when you start up dwarf fortress, it makes history.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: that's a pretty good analogy</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: also I remember the gardean mentioning that our univers was never suposed to have a session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which would explain the lack of ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, say your running say, 50 instances of the dwarf fortress generation at once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: oh my</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: in the Void Session, Roxy/Dirk/Jake's planets appeared after Jane's, but they still looked "millions of years too old"</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thats a bit extream</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: So then</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: This is the reverse</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (could it be ?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: of a void session ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: instead of no prototyping there's THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I believe so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: so, Skaian overload ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Skaia will likely be the site of the most glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what is the reverse of a void session anyways? a light session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: we're more on the scale of the Squiddle Session, but with more than 48 players</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Such as the clouds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: shit with so many prospit dreamers the skaian sky must be all clouds</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, thats more ammount of towers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: Null is everything goes right but doomed to fail, Void is no-protos, Dead is singleplayer... we are None Of The Above.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The moon is a spikey ball.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a death star?</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: OH SHIT</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: the one Hussie joked about, the 48-player session that made Beforus/Alternia</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: CFL: The moon is a spikey ball.  &lt;- I had that idea about a Prospit-themed flail weapon</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Prospic Flail</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Thats alot of water</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...pardon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does water have to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: squiddle session</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: to suport Squiddles the incipisphere must hev been a big ball ow water</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...on the lands themselves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, the medium might have had the ability to support them without water</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I think sburb has an intended max playercount of 144 (12 normal classes * 12 aspects)... any more than that and you have to double up on claspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: that'd explain a lot</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And/Or you get wierd stuff like the Lord of Blood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Lord of Space</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: though maybe it'd be dividing major aspects in two or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: except Lord and Muse are only available in one- and two-player sessions...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ is right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I mean extrapolating on existing aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are in a glitching mess, so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we have lost at least 2 players already apparently.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: speaking of... I wonder if the glitches are because FG got lazy and started patching in code from other games</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: the SPM apples from the Overthere, my land's consort villages and denizen palace ripping off Thousand-Year Door Chapter 7...</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: hehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, how would you normally make those overthere apples?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Super Paper Mario &amp;&amp; Apples?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: usually they spawn on trees when you enter a part of the level IIRC</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: and the fact that the Okami things I've alchemized work seamlessly, plus according to Ammysprite, it was always intended to be part of my quest</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: FL: captcharoid zoomed in on an SPM screenshot, a pictionary scribblepad, or idk</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: actually... I think when we access the "normal" net, we might actually be accessing the net of an alternate-timeline Earth, one where Sbarg was never a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: since I've been able to watch all my favorite youtube channels just fine after entry, and they've updated just as they always have been</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: idk, just a theory. I'm full of those today, apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that would explain how TF2 still works</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Steam.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, if thats the way its going, I guess we are gonna have to wait for a movie to get on nexflix or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or use captcharoid on the box art.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which works fantastically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I still can't get Pokemon X and Y, likely because of the RP...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: if somehow we ever get back to Earth with our powers and equipment intact, captcharoid + alchemiter = ultimate counterfieting thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: whats the code for a capacharoid? or do I need to make it useing my own sylidex for it to work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: any camera &amp;&amp; an empty captcha card, regardless of fetch modus</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I would be making nano tubes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: but we would run out of grist CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: the camera determines the shape of the captcharoid</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and have no way to get more</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 11111111, plus a camera.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: ...crap, that's right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Artifact?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the gold mega reflective paint?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is there a way to convert artifact grist into regular grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: the stock exchange on any Time player's planet, I assume</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: if there ways the games balnce would be broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: was*</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((reasoning: what else would the LOHACSE be for, other than timey-wimey boonbond farming?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know what? I should have gotten the code for a portal while I was on FI's land so that I could try to make the portal to the secret cow level.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: the wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: secret cow level</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: where?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What balance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is this gold paint... that gives gold grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So Its not just artifact.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But it attracts underlings, see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll see if I can get some shipped to derse... and have the derse players flood the archagents room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wouldent that just make Jack mad?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be the greatest prank ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a good way to get assasinated</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it would give me an actual use for it other than shooting at horror terrors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I am just worry if we do something to Jack he will go beck nor on us</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can see them easier now though!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: bec noir.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thank you</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and you know what i ment</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: he won't go Bec Noir (or to use Replay Value AU's more generic term, Ringwraith) on us since no one prototyped a clown. the clown stuff is what made him go shithive maggots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, I haven't seen the hats yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I mean because we fill his office with... what was it again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Underling attracting glowing golden paint.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: underling-attracting gold paint, I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((damn, we posted at exactly the same nanosecond FL))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: The queen might laugh at him</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it doesn't actually glow, but it reflects more than the light that goes into it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wich would lead to an assasination</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Negative grist stuff violate most of the laws of physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which would lead to queen Jack</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just something we need to think about...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, plan b.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and look at the stuff we prptotyped he would be very powerfull</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pour it into the vault.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, once something goes into that, its... deleted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: why put it in the royal vault?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats the usual use for it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sburbs trash can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: there I made a capacharoid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know what the glitches are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They are entrances to the vault.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thats sacarry</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THE PLAYERS CONSUMED BY THEM ARE DELETED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I was going to say Undeleted RAM, like that one episode of ReBoot with the system crashing and letting User Player-Characters into Mainframe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: DS, what is it</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: If you want a portal to FI's land I can give you a ride</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: portal from*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Or I could make one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I did get the code for a time portal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Too much grist, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Sj wants a portal to some cow place</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 0CIUXjp!</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: FL try making a time Tunnle</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((also if we're canon-welding Replay Value into Sbarg, don't forget there's another more benign "glitch" portal type, the Skaian Magicant))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: it should be cheeper</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it needs a regular portal &amp;&amp; a leg of some sort.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It follows a similar pattern to the one from futurama.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cow leg, to be specific.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ...wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, think you could extract the blue from a blue portal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: quck comeone find a pic of a cow then capacaroid it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: we can still access Non-Sbarg-Timeline-Earth's internet, go google image search one</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wouldent it be a collorless portal than&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I dont want a cow in my house</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I will never get it down the stairs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, while making the long fall boots, I also made the code for the dual portal device.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: but then you would need portal surfaces</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: s3tSztWo</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, the walls of the houses... kinda work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It costs a ton of grist, but its affordable now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: if this game has a bit of Source Engine code in it, assume that metal-class surfaces are portalproof and anything else flat and large enough can be portaled</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: my house has siding</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Interior.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and my house isn't getting siding when building up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: meh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, it would help for climbing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I wonder what the 4th gate will do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe the exact same as the third?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean second?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: posebly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except backwards?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, first person who contacts you is bootstrapped into your 4th gate leading there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: how could that be backward</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: hmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I hope TT contacts me first</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I see two possibilities: either it does the "last person you chatted to" thing (we gotta prioiritize connecting to people who are away from the main group), or it links to whoever's second gate leads to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, if I were to contact someone on the main chain...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: traversing the AE net is time consuming</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, lots of people's second gate lead to TT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ...wait. FUCK. what about those who have multiple inbound Gate 2s, like AE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: mine leads to SJ's</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: nothing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I figure it would be easier for the guardian to do the a person contacts you becomes your 4th gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: RS never linked their Second Gate to anyone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you forgot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not on the chart yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...SV!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When are you gonna update the chart?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Update as in what, and why?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((You do know that was out of character))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((though NN's list is IC for some reason))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, RS goes to TT...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Added.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: may i have a link?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, what is the most recent chart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...kinda wish it auto updated...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, heart for me...</span><br />
