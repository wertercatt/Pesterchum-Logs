[05:24:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I should just</span><br />
[05:24:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: stop.</span><br />
[05:25:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:25:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[05:25:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just feel like I'm a major source of frustration in the session</span><br />
[05:28:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously, I /know/ that was a shitty retcon.</span><br />
[05:29:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but it doesn't stop the mental image of FL diving after a flaming match and catching it with his /teeth/ from being too awesome/funny/fucked up to be canon.</span><br />
[05:31:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe I'm just not cut out for SBARG anymore.</span><br />
[05:31:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :/</span><br />
[05:32:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, that thing with prometheus stealing the heart of the land... was supposed to be a replay value reference, not a reference to RS's awesome land quest.</span><br />
[05:35:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and really, I've been kinda hoping that v2 could end so we could start again anew.</span><br />
[05:35:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:35:09] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh man thanks</span><br />
[05:35:44] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And sorry for ribbing you as if it was a rip, I know they were actually different and not really close to anything I'd done</span><br />
[05:36:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah I just... augh.</span><br />
[05:36:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, you want a SBARGv3?</span><br />
[05:36:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It feels like one of the biggest mistakes I made in regards to v2</span><br />
[05:36:24] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: SBARG v1.5</span><br />
[05:37:11] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#410f41">CURRENT symphonicAnima [CSA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:37:11] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: why more SBARG</span><br />
[05:37:12] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: why this</span><br />
[05:37:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk, I know I wasn't in SCODE (since I didn't find out about it until after it ended), but it seemed like a SBARGv1.5 to me...</span><br />
[05:37:20] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: ahahahAHAHAHAHA </span><br />
[05:37:21] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: no.</span><br />
[05:37:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I felt I had to rush that plot</span><br />
[05:37:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so I did it with antimatter</span><br />
[05:38:13] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: ,,,</span><br />
[05:38:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which deprived the story of the reveal that Dolos wasn't FL's denizen.</span><br />
[05:38:26] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: FL antimatter does not count as suitable replacement</span><br />
[05:38:27] <span style="color:#410f41">CSA: for actual plot</span><br />
[05:39:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I should have just flipped off the GM and did things the way I originally planned.</span><br />
[05:39:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I guess did sorta happen anyway?</span><br />
[05:40:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except in a way that it was a steaming pile of crap by the end</span><br />
[05:41:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus FL being an idiot is kinda... engrained into SBARG now.</span><br />
[05:42:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess that was a lesson that I need to be more flexible with my plots</span><br />
[05:42:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cause I didn't really expect the DT fall out, which basically fucked with my plans even more</span><br />
[05:44:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah that was my fault, shouldn't have had so many relyances</span><br />
[05:45:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If DT had been broken more, and transfered into FL's shades when he tiered</span><br />
[05:45:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that plot element would have made more sense</span><br />
[05:46:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like originally</span><br />
[05:47:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The entire debate over the land's heart should have taken more time</span><br />
[05:48:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like Prometheus shows up at the bacafe peacefully and FL and him get into this entire debate and FL is defeated in that debate, wondering, and I quote</span><br />
[05:48:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FORRRRR"</span><br />
[05:48:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah I rushed things and it turned to crap</span><br />
[05:50:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and now I'm left making horrible lands like "Land of Spikes and Traps" like</span><br />
[05:50:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what the fuck am I even doing</span><br />
[05:51:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... you still have time to recover your plot, if you want to try...</span><br />
[05:51:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no</span><br />
[05:51:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't retcon the universe, as it isn't mine</span><br />
[05:52:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't mean retcon, I mean try to resolve your plot thread in a better way...</span><br />
[05:52:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: to be fair overseer is more fun these days</span><br />
[05:52:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: isn't that weird? How that simplistic text adventure is more fun than the RP.</span><br />
[05:54:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I tend to like the mechanical systems of alchemy and such a bit more</span><br />
[05:56:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and in the end I just make a sadistic videogame land</span><br />
[05:58:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wanna be the guy: The Land</span><br />
[05:58:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is basically Land of Spikes and Traps</span><br />
[06:00:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously how do you fix a plot when its over</span><br />
[06:04:42] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: :\</span><br />
[06:04:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Work on what you can moving forward</span><br />
[06:06:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe</span><br />
