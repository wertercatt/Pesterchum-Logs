<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I'm sorry but if he can't actually listen to anyone and keeps trying to impose himself on people who don't want him then I wont have anything to do with him. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Does that mean we can find a topic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I thought we were talking about tactics for handling Chronos Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Anyone have any non-Grid, non-Ring ideas for possible ambush locations or places we could lure him where his powers would be fucked up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm not really no. I like fighting him at the edge of the Furthest Ring. If we do that we cna utilize our Void players to guide us and our attacks through teh area while he will be blind. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That will allow us to get the drop on him and then hit him with hit and run attacks. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I'd say that the first ambush should be the ones where we do what we can to disable him. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Then we just need to protect the Time/Space players and whittle him down. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We'd be dealing with the horrorterrors nearby, as the only major disadvantage I can see of trying to lure him out there. Would taking Space/Timers out into the Ring and lettin' 'em see how well they do with their powers in fucktarded dimensions be a good idea to see how it might affect 'em?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The horrorterrors probably hate Chrono.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That would be prudent yes. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Considering what he did to them last session I'd agree with NV. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 'Course they hate him, he killed a fuckton. So they'd probably have higher priorities than us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The Rings/Sceptres. Good stakes or no? How would we /get/ them, exactly? Don't we need the Sceptre to cause the Reckoning?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ If he wanted them he would have taken them already Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ The rings and scepters can be a double-edged sword deal /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ While theyy make good bait he can just as easilyy time fuck them into his posession /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I'm not sure that he couldn't use them himself Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Then whatta we do /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ We become a doomed timeline and send our time players back Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Because he will have killed most of us Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … What are things he's shown an interest in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If Ornis actually posed a credible threat to him or was doing much more of anything, I'd think about suggesting him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I honestly don't have much faith in our Guardian. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nor do I. However, the first time I ever met him, the concept of using him as bait /was/ okayed by him-- he said he'd be willing to do what was needed for us, or something like that. The paradox machina was also suggested bait, but we fucked that up already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm its a possibility at least. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I reaaaaally don't think he has enough idea of what's going on to be y'know, useful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Which is weird, considering First Guardians are supposed to be, like, omnicient or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm not sure how much if anything he knows about what we're even doing. So. Yeah. Chronos has /said/ as much-- that if he's inactive, birdbrain's in the same boat.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The First Guardian that is Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … We could ask 'im.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Might as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ true Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But, CA, GCat was shown to be in a Session.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ hmmmm true Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Nevermind then Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might be a good idea to ask anyways. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: He's in a session, but he doesn't belong there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's technically possible for a Guardian to at least be in a Session, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, but he ain't guarding shit, or playing some essential function.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean for all we know, Chronos made him and put him here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: He was never even on Earth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That is also a possiblity Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ It might make sense if Chronos really is doomed and is buying time for himself. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We also know specifically that Seth ectobiologised Ornis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Seth, the presumed younger self of Chronos, who's fuck knows where at the moment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So technically Chronos /did/ make him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Right which is one of the only reasons why Chronos hasn't been paradoxed out of existence. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Considering the last game was supposed to stop him from ever existing. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ And yet somehow there appeared a First Guardian who convinced us all to play Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ One made by Seth Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Actually, the original "Guardian" who convinced us to play was Chronos himself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Yeah it was wasn't it? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Same thing then Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yup. Still… I guess we do exist, and all this exists, so… /something/ must have either gone terribly right or horribly wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Too many things here don't make sense. Either this game is full of plot holes or we just don't know enough yet Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Did you know ectobiologising ourselves is apparently not a thing in this Session, according to the big bad himself this morning?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That makes sense considering we may very well be universe 0 in the long chain of universes Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And yet the meteors still fell...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow he answered what Ornis couldn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's fantastic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Meteors'll always fall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: True, with the Reckoning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Doesn't really serve a purpose this time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what about the frog temple? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, that's apparently a thing. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ ....I hesitate to ask this but have you noticed Chronos betting more oily as the game has gone on? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … You mean physically?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, my theory is he's dissolving into like a pile of goo or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Might make sense. The original body he had was solid. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My theory is that he's turning into some super shitty attempt at slenderman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe he's going to transform into a beautiful butterfly.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that is officially the weirdest theory I've heard so far. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … So, back to the baiting idea. Does /anyone/ have /anything/ that isn't the power items or our Guardian to use as bait ideas?</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Well we talked about what we've done lately progresswise and then went into plans on handling Chronos Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ambush locations, tactics, baits, etc Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Two possible ambush locations are right next to the Furthest Ring and at a portal to the Magicant. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SJ's, not to over emphasize, but you're probably our biggest upperhand.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ If we can use her and our space players to disable Chronos' powers then we can more easily take him out Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Its why I want to use the edge of the Furthest Ring Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: which leaves him as a Space player...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: should be easy, so long as we avoid telefragmentation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ With our void players we can hit him with hit and run attacks while he is disabled and minimalize casualties Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And in the Ring, Spacetime is converted to Fucky McFuckland. Possibly. I wanna take Space/Timers out there to see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ My idea was to use our Space players to blunt the majority of his offensive Space powers Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Then use the Furthest ring and stealth items to hide our Space/Time players so he can't kill them. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Also, we have two Knights of Void that are around. Those can help with the hiding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: do we have a rogue of void?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ How many Void players do we have? Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm more than enough to form up attack groups around them Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The main idea would probably be to herd him deeper into the Furthest Ring Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but we would also need a void player or a space player that can help veil our space players</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ It would fit the theme Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And EP doesn't want to be involved with this shit at all. Ugh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: maybe?</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or do anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: could certainly make it difficult for chronos to land a direct hit though./</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Then we have two options with trade offs. We could have a knight cover the Time and Space players or we could use the knight as a sheild for the attack groups. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I'd say using the Maid would be best Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: AA's been out of contact for /forever/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Possibly dead by now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: shit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Rely on the pair of Knights and pair of Thieves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ We need an updated classpect list Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I only keep track of Voiders.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ anything editable we can use? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We /could/ use a logged-in pastebin or piratepad?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ piratepad may be better? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Piratepad sounds like the better option, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#008282">[CCA]</span>  taps the side of his glassestop. Right CP is making it. I say we get a current force count and test the capabilities of our Time and Space players in the Furthest Ring for immediate goals. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ ""* Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ If we want to ambush Chronos in that location then we'll need to take every advantage. If we can force him further into the ring while disabling his powers we could come out of this with less casualties on our side. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Plus, people should think of ways we /can/ lure Chronos into a trap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Manipulative or bait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or anything!</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I almost want to say we have someone challenge him to a fight at teh edge of the Veil. He has proven to have an esily bruised ego in the past. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: encourage him to show up at the BaCafe and get him riled up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: then drop the tease and have everyone leave, saying they don't want to fight a sore loser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: draw him out and towards the outer areas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: follow through.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That runs the risk of him wrecking the place with another black hole Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we run that risk consistently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I'm working on being able to track Chronos. He's not /everywhere/ like I'd originally thought, but there are a lot of patches of space where it feels like he /should be/ but isn't, and the space there is… subtly very wrong. The number of results for him is constantly changing as they move around, make new ones, and split. One of them would be him. Probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just to let those who don't know, the loiar HQ is currently shut down because of the results of the last meeting. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i never heard how bad it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  glanced around, awaiting an answer. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ what happened? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's an encouraging title.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Inactivity check up to date.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i have no clue what that means</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's kinda unclear, the last bit of the transcipt that is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i'd already read up on the first bits.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, I forgot there was a block of glitched text at the end...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no it just got unclear</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TT shows up</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you all abscond, i think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ???</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uMMMM,,,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...TT demanded everyone evacuate her land...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, idk either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  let out a hum and nodded. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so the normal HQ is..., what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: destroyed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Fine, I think. Not really sure. Haven't status-checked it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's still intact, but off-limits as fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright./</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I keep pestering TT to send Ash the .sbuild file for the HQ, but she isn't getting around to it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She was pretty psychotic last time immediately after everybody got evacuated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Literally smashing shit, destroying shit, nuked my decoy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: plot twist, TT is crazy unstable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I think she finally got tired of everyone's shit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: never saw that coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Twist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  sighed and rolled his shoulders. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My sides.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ le sigh Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm once we get the list going I say we parse out the Time and Space players and figure out how to best use the ones that will show up. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  leaned back against a wall as he cross his arms over, thinking. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ For a general plan I think that once we start the ambush and disable his powers as best we can we can have the different attack groups hit him from different angles with the intent to drive him farther into the Ring. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ From there we would have to have most of the attack groups do hit and run attacks and then fade off into the Void. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ One group will probably have to play rear guard and herd him back away from the Session if he goes that way. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this is trusting he doesn't outright decimate any immediate attack groups.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: got any ideas for that, should he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I'm thinking that the Knights of Void will be good for that. If we can gank his abilities enough then he won't just go black hole on his and kill us all Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: do we have a Prince of Space?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ We'd need some classpect combinations to lead the groups and act shields against the worst of his power Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ let me check Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Not that I can tell Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that'll be our greatest open spot then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I should probably alchemize an Emergency Point Swap Badge and Happy Heart/Happy Flower Badges for /everyone/ to help with preventing the "getting killed" bit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: noty sure how much help it will be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Chronos has a nack for being rather... instant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, considering EPS activates /the same tick that the wearer's HP hits zero/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  shrugged. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it doesn't even let the Clock of Heroic Justness trigger for tiered players, if I remember correctly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: put as much faith into items as you want.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'd rather rely on guarantees and have whatever fallbacks we can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's at least one more line of "keep people alive", even if it's not foolproof. if you hit 0HP and also have 0FP/MP/whatever, /then/ you actually do die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so it is technically more of a fallback</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: which also requires the player to have a non-standard extra bar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Are Space players that have been active are doctorSpace and Ashes Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Maid and Knight respectively Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: DS isn't that active.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … A Witch of Space is sitting in this room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Shon is usually undependable ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ wait who? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ MA? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Literally, Envy is /right there/, he's been talking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((he kinda isn't here right now?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( admittedly he's not here /now/ but you would have noticed him son of a bitch ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So Witch and Knight at worst and  Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( *didn't notice he had stopped responding* ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Witch, Knight, Maid at best Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ((I didnt know his classpect?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( ah okay ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ We'll have them go out to the Ring with Gambit or another Void player and see how their power is effected Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Some with our Time players Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Same* Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we should see if we could gather a ring of life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do, uh. Those exist in prototyped Sessions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's a fair point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't think those are an option around here... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  nodded. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Huh. Forty-two Players on the active list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ the only issue is can we get them all there in time Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've never seen that many around /at once/, so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the most I've seen was like, 28 or something, and that was at the prospit ball. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: That was quite a while ago, too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that was actually a question in "Are You Smarter Than A Denizen?", it was 27 people there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ One of the only ways to gather that many people is to make something public Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ And give advanced notice Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm maybe we could present Chronos with a very tempting target? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Except that when he attacks we'd all be ready Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I wonder if our First Guardian would be willing to facillitate a mass teleportation? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What sort of target?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Really, how are we getting him where we want?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ A large gathering of active players is prime time for him to show up Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ He has enough ego for it that he wouldnt be able to resist Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ One way to get to the Ring would be to have our First Guardian mass teleport us if he can Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: likely all we'll have to do to get him to appear to is misspell his name three times in a mirror. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ heh Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: three different ways, or the same way three times?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Works for me. How would we gather the Players though? With what subterfuge would we lure them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Another ball or giant party? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ a "Grand Strategy Meeting?" Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hm. Possibly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So long as everyone knows beforehand it would work Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ of course we'd have to talk to everyone beforehand Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if everyone knows, chronos will probably figure out easily. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We fucking /suck/ at keeping secrets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the question is, can we turn that flaw into an advantage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The only way we'd be able to get this to work is if most if not all of them knew about the ambush Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmmm maybe we somehow swear them all to secrecy when we tell them before the ball Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We just /really suck/ at keeping even explicitly-told secrets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ We'll all die if we dont tell them though Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Yeah. Ugh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Even if they spill that its an aumbush I think Chronos would show up anyways Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 'Cause of his ego.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ And he is an  idiot Σ</span><br />
