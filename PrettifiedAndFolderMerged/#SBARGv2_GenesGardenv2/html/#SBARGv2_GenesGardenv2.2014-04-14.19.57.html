[19:57:12] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Hello?</span><br />
[19:57:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[19:57:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks up from his plate of pizza rolls --</span><br />
[19:57:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
[19:57:56] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Noone got on the memo... I was getting worried.</span><br />
[19:58:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#8f8b12">CURRENT submissiveBehemoth [CSB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[19:58:35] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: You ever get around to making the potion?</span><br />
[19:58:54] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Still need the baslisk venom.</span><br />
[19:59:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT submissiveBehemoth <span style="color:#8f8b12">[CSB]</span>  holds up little vial --</span><br />
[19:59:58] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...how did you...</span><br />
[20:01:07] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: If there's one thing I can predict about you, it's your ability to fuck things up. So I'm giving you a free save.</span><br />
[20:01:28] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[20:01:46] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So I basically end up getting a free ticket.</span><br />
[20:01:48] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[20:02:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  hands over the phoenix feather and unicorn hair --</span><br />
[20:02:26] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I would rather look myself.</span><br />
[20:02:51] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: If you say so. Try not to die all three times.</span><br />
[20:02:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT submissiveBehemoth <span style="color:#8f8b12">[CSB]</span>  puts things away. --</span><br />
[20:03:24] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Eh, I had a good plan for handling the baslisk.</span><br />
[20:04:09] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: I'm more concerned about the other two. They tend to be tempramental.</span><br />
[20:04:53] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: True. But if I can't handle that peacefully, do I really deserve the ability to use magic?</span><br />
[20:05:43] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ..Yes. You do are tempramental just means they will fuck you up for no reason, right?</span><br />
[20:05:49] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ((wow what))</span><br />
[20:05:52] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ((do know*))</span><br />
[20:06:16] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ((/lays off the cocoa pebbles they are impairing my judgement))</span><br />
[20:06:21] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I wouldn't say no reason. I would say /little/ reason.</span><br />
[20:06:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And there is a difference.</span><br />
[20:07:16] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Still, just because someone can't handle sourpuss beings doesn't mean they don't deserve to do magic.</span><br />
[20:07:23] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I mean, there is /always/ a reason. Maybe the person that just stabbed you for hugging them just likes the stabs.</span><br />

[20:07:53] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: I mean, I cowered for 500 years from a pheonix that I couldn't handle, and I didn't get my ability revoked.</span><br />

[20:09:24] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: I think you'll have proved yourself if you can even get at least one of the items.</span><br />
[20:09:56] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Without killing the source.</span><br />
[20:11:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...getting items for /what/, again?</span><br />
[20:11:39] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: As a tip, unicorns and their kin enjoy being talked to. Especially flattery.</span><br />
