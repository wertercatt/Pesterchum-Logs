<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT innocuousAffectation <span style="color:#4fb884">[CIA]</span>  nods and smiles --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: Thanks person! I feel better now!</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: what IA said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: good, see, don't stop now, keep breathing and focus on my voice</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT carefulCommando <span style="color:#00aa7f">[CCC]</span>  gets up, dusts self off --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: as much as i'd love to gather you all together for a nice witch hunt. i think we should focus on the matters at hand. who all agrees?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: I'm Anna, by the way... I doubt one pissy player is going to tip the balance right now, look how many of us there are just here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: I'm Ryan!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT carefulCommando <span style="color:#00aa7f">[CCC]</span>  offers a hand --</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: I don't care about DD right now. We're talking in a meeting. Let's do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...If he becomes a problem, I can counter him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Continue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT innocuousAffectation <span style="color:#4fb884">[CIA]</span>  shakes Ryan's hand. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT carefulCommando <span style="color:#00aa7f">[CCC]</span>  pulls IA in for a hug --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: We'll figure that guy out later, 'kay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: This is my 'thank you', by the way!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: I think he's just throwing a tantru-</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  looked around, checking for more opinions as he looked at everyone's faces. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I can throw him into the blue hole later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT innocuousAffectation <span style="color:#4fb884">[CIA]</span>  blinks and freezes a little and then awkwardly hugs him back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT carefulCommando <span style="color:#00aa7f">[CCC]</span>  has no idea of how awkward this is because he's CC, enough said --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so we'll focus on this then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: o-okay...so...back to the meeting, y-yeah?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: Okay, I'm good!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT carefulCommando <span style="color:#00aa7f">[CCC]</span>  pulls away --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  nodded, getting the sense of the room, as he thought for a moment. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yes. Like I said, if he tries anything, I can counter his Aspect shenanigans...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so. two major things need to be figured out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: first of all being how we deal with the ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ectobiology and the Battlefield.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ornis can give us some help with the former.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the latter on the other hand will come to a vote.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: way i see it we have three options.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's wait until Rob stops faffing about before we come to an extreme vote.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's still a few people who probably would want to weigh in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Wouldn't hurt to hear the options, though. Sleep on 'em.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's all i mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no need to rush things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 's all good, let's hear 'em.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: one option is to oppose the game and destroy prospit's army. kill their white king and steal the scepter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: then we can activate the reckoning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Or we can just steal the scepter directly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or just ask them ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Larceny~</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Asking's going to be a bit of a bad idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: all good suggestions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: another idea is to side with prospit and use them to help us defeat the black king.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: after all he is the final boss chronos aside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: We do need the meteors from the Reckoning, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we can always find other ways to launch meteors ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We need Skaia to open its defense gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: The meteors carry our ectobabies. And Skaia only opens defence portals when the Reckoning's meteors with our babies on them start hitting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...That's true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: siding with prospit initially will make fighting the black king easier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we'll have to get the white scepter regardless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: He might just hand it over, White King's pretty amiable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there's the chance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But either way we could probably initiate it ourselves when we need to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: possibly. someone will need scepter or mace kind though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Anybody want the job?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: here's the problem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well that's jumping the gun I guess, we'll figure something out later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I have thta, SE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we don't know if a player can activate the reckoning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it could be something that only something that can be prototyped can use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: which is why it may be safer to take the third option.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: help derse win.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: … Or give the Sceptre to the Black King.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if we can get them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and even then it's not like the derse king would let us just walk up and offer it to him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We'll sleep on 'em, they're alll pretty good plans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: But if he just… I dunno… finds it lying nearby him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Bleh, I dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: point being the moment we confront the black king we have to fight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but that works too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: now. i know you might all have opposing ideas towards this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...either way, we need to hear from Ornis about the ectobiology, right?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nothing's set in stone yet, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We can discuss 'em later then, there's no rush.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Other than trying to get the Land quests done...</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: But, hey. We just had a meeting. Where no one started fighting and yelling. And we agreed on stuff and proposed ideas and didn't bicker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: point being though. when it comes to vote. majority wins. and it has to be a fair margin. we can't have anymore infighting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, we're on a good start to actual teamwork.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT innocuousAffectation <span style="color:#4fb884">[CIA]</span>  smiles --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Normally I don't say I'm proud of people but this is pretty monumental.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Can we, like, try to /stay/ like this? It's… really nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: heh<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span> yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, we'll try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm certain we can try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  smiles --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, there are a few people that didn't come...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: got a blood player heading this shit so i don't see why not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Tomorrow we'll talk again, this is probably a lot to take in and stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: obviously. we'll set a date for all the major shit down the road.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: for now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sleep on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: set some shit up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: For now we've got a lot of robots to deface.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: How about we try to get in contact with those Players we know exist but don't see very much of?</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: To try to let them know what's up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1f1f">CLC: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that'd be a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll try and do that if I can, maybe a tumblr message.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anyone else have any ideas?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: any points to make?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean. we're all here so might as well say them now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've still gotta talk with Rob to see if we're letting this cat outta the bag.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: No blurting out anything on Incip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: We don't know who's watching or hearing us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I do need help retrieving something tomorrow if anybody's willing to help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Ash is working on the frog breeding...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, yeah. Stay quiet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: First rule of plans meetings: don't talk about plans meetings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  giggles lightly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: second rule of plans meeting: DON'T TALK about plans meetings</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's not the usual fight club reverse psychology</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: ...what's the first rule?</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: I saaaid the first rule, IA!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: oh! sorry I missed it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: still! anyone got anything else to bring up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or you all taken care of</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT innocuousAffectation <span style="color:#4fb884">[CIA]</span>  chuckles a little with her hand on her mouth --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I think we're ok for now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Besides a thrilling dungeon romp tomorrow, I'm all worded out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: Hum… I'm good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT loliChronos <span style="color:#1f1f1f">[CLC]</span>  hasn't really paid attention to the discussion so she'll probably not blab about it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But really, if anybody needs help on their planet, just say the word.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: uh...was that tantrum guy worth talking about again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If we're going to do this quick and quietly, it's all in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: Nah, he's...what did Leon call Saddler?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: Oh yeah! Small time. HE'S small time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think we should have some protocol towards shit like that. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT innocuousAffectation <span style="color:#4fb884">[CIA]</span>  smiles at CC --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause we all know how much death threats get thrown about in here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That isn't punching them or going "MEANY".</span><br />
