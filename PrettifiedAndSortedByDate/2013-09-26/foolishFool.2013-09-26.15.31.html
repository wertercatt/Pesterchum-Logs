[03:39:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: why is it not a dungeon.</span><br />
[03:40:03] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...because it would be too simple.</span><br />
[03:41:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its a gog damn business building</span><br />
[03:42:42] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...hm... interesting...</span><br />

[03:51:55] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...FL. Calm the Fuck DOWN.</span><br />
[03:52:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its not really the fact that I actually killed him or not is why I'm mad</span><br />
[03:52:45] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...Then What is the reason.</span><br />
[03:52:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its the fact that everyone made me feel like I was the one that needed to do the deed.</span><br />
[03:53:17] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...</span><br />
[03:53:28] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: That what confuses me.</span><br />
[03:53:47] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: WHY did you feel you had to do that? You could have fought them.</span><br />
[03:54:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Because right there, I didn't care about DT... I only cared about my own skin.</span><br />
[03:54:57] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...</span><br />
[03:55:01] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: Why?</span><br />
[03:55:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: If I had fought, there is a large chance I would have died protecting him.</span><br />
[03:55:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...and both of us would have died.</span><br />
[03:56:29] <span style="color:#a8a87e">FF: ...Are you sure about that? I seriosuly doubt they would ahve fought to kill.</span><br />
[03:57:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Then that adds even more to my point.</span><br />
