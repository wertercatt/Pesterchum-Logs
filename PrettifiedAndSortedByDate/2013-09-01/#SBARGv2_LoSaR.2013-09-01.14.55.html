<span style="color:#887000">CSL: adopted a spider consort</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because I can /probably/ get on it. And then murderalise everyone who stands between me and keeping it as loot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: This will include /you/ if need be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well we are getting on the ship so</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: we save the spider and then i guess ag wants to hijack the ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: spider is first priority though</span><br />

The narration approves.<br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *glides towards the docking bay*</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: As the party comes closer, several doors on the side of the ship open. Chitinous armored soldiers with beetle wings emerge, holding energy blasters.</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CSG: The blaster is stolen, but it cannot be used without an appropriate specibus.</span><br />
