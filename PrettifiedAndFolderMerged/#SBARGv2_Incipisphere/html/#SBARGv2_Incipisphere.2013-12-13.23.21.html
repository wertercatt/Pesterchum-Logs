<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi Kim! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: slight pain from face-desking. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know thosebots AC made? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what did he do this time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: lets just say I don't think they know what they're doing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: crazy stuff involving AI-initiated possession or something like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((AC did this to his own alts, and I really wish he would get better at writing for all these characters he comes up with.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in other news, Seth posted a thing on the chumplist. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sigh. I get home from a pretty cool party only to facepalm x2 combo.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........ouch. poor Seth and Brae :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I hope we can find some sorta solution for them. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... considering they saved our butts from the <span style="color:#004dbc">Blue Hole</span> and all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so besides that, anything else happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not really. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aw, Greenflower Zone Act 1.mp3 loops funny :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and by that, I mean the loop point should start about four seconds in, after the intro... but WMP doesn't have that capability)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, complex loop points... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: VLC probably can do it... but then again, it doesn't respond to the media hotkeys unless the window is in focus (whereas WMP responds to them no matter how many windows it's buried under)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, do the mp3 files even have the loop points embedd in them? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've heard that can be a thing for .ogg files, but I'm not sure about mp3 files. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doubt it, the game probably just has the loop points hardcoded...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus, the mp3s aren't actually ripped from the game files, they're separate</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, you're saying that these files only have it loop a total of one time manually without a way to easily listen to it properly looped without overcomplicated shenanigans? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...either that, or in the game itself, they went the Dungeons of Dredmor way and have the intro and looping part be two different files...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then play the intro once and after that loop the repeating part</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, gnight</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: goodnight Kim. ➜</span><br />
