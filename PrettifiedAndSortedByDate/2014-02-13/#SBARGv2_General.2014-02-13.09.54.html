<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Official Release of Story: slothfulLunchmeat, aka Ben, was last seen taking his ship into space. When asked where he was going, Ben replied that he picked up an emergency signal that needed to be looked at right away. In doing so, he left someone else in charge of QuinnPrime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: That is all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just as a slight fact-check, it was mentioned that his personal ship: the Lunar Whale, does not have a warp drive. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: which means he wasn't warping anywhere but just, cruising out I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: either way, he's off-planet and unreachable? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Again I wonder if a leader's really necessary, that kind of thing seems to fall apart quickly</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm wondering if having Seth take the wheel would make any sense in this context. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: on one hand, he's had one trip into space and doesn't want to be anywhere near FL, but on the other hand, he might be interested in taking up a leadership role. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, I can probably see him up and quitting due to not having a tight enough bond with the group and not wanting to deal with the shenanigans. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: who was the closest to SL anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, SL mentioned that he would trust SJ with his spidergrandson, but I'm not so sure about a ship, not to mention SJ prefers not to have an active role in things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: what about PW and GX?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Not entirely sure what was going on there</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Goddamn I should shut up and get to typing that memoir.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (wh is it so hard to draw a batmobile) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *why ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Because batmobiles hate us all. When we aren't looking, they're conspirating as to how to destroy humanity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I just had an idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: SBARGv2 AU where the First Guardian is a The Cheat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I'm going to draw that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <span style="color:#00ff00">meh!</span> ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: There.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Our First The Cheatian, The Cheat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I can get behind that :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You want a better hat? Too bad. We're going Dwarf Fortress in terms of "shitty art".</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You want a hat that bronies don't wear? Deal with it. The Cheat is so cool he can make a trilby look good again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heck, SL's already made canon that wolfmode!CP uses the Strong Bad typing method.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You want no spots for maximum First Guardian? Well, you got me there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You want art I made? Well give me a second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT irrelevantDestinies <span style="color:#aaaa00">[CID]</span>  proceeds to jump out window --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eh, I have nothing against the hat. Honestly I wish those kinda hats weren't associated with the group that they're currently associated with nowadays. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Yeah, you got a point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I wish trilbies were still classy and not friendzony.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Kimura!CP, how much of this are you putting in sbargv2outofcontext?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm... actually not v2oocing any of this right now, nor did I remember to submit that thing from earlier. currently too busy playing danganronpa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: ;_;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (but there's no rule saying you can't submit your own quotes, so...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I will not be immortalized. Daisoujou is unpleased.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (........and I'm still trying to figure out who you are, ID...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: DD/CC/MM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Isn't my Aura of Shittiness(tm) enough of a giveaway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: it could be mistaken for others</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I could tell who you were by a combination of text coor, personality traits, and references known. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *color ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So I'm that shallow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no, just distinctive ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I never asked for this sadness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I'm going to drink myself into an alcoholic depression, which is ironic, considering why I started in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it might be more that I'm good at figuring stuff out/ I've been here for 5 ever and remember almost everyone or something  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: the latter seems more feasible</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMM</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So who remembers who Bonerfart was?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember the name, not exactly who the name was given to. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing it was MM? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: No, MM was the irrelevant one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I think it was the Imp that backstabbed DD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, that thing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, have you read the actually updated improved infopage yet? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: The one in the memo greeting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Sure did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so you know about the new universe stuff and who runs the place? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You, FA, and Kaylen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: NN is an admin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. (just as a note, I'm the most leniant of the bunch and usually don't make that many huge descisions) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: my role is mostly as welcome wagon, canon consultant, and watching over the IC memos. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, tonight's slow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So why do we have a time for Vanilla Earth? IIRC, that's the one that got METEOR'D, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Or is that another Earth because you can never have too many Earths?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because most people use the old time system for reference. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: considering starter planet has a 26 hour day. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh, I getcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because everyone is still hardwired for a 24-hour day</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So no humans on the Starter Planet yet, I'm guessing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: besides the players, and visitors from other sessions, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: In that case, I suppose Oy Vey's coming back!</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: remember, the sylph of life? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I know who.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: The redundant one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I mean "wat" as in "wasn't he killed in the reckoning or something"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was generally accepted that he and that GnG guy ran off to have adventures together. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: My headcanon for him is that he has the most overpowered Classpect that isn't a double tier, in terms of "FUCK WHY ISN'T THIS GUY DYING".</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So yeah, he's back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: And before you ask, he's worthless at fighting, so he's not TOO overpowered...right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it sounds alright. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So he's a White Mage with hollow bones and on magical steroids.</span><br />
