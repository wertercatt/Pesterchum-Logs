[12:47:07] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Hello?</span><br />

[13:31:11] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: m...mornin</span><br />
[13:38:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Hello, people from the past!</span><br />
[13:38:44] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: what</span><br />
[13:38:58] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: You are prescratch right?</span><br />
[13:39:05] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: That means you are totally from the past</span><br />
[13:39:14] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: uhh</span><br />
[13:39:16] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: okay</span><br />
[13:39:25] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: (what the fuck is going on this time)</span><br />
[13:39:29] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: in the structure of branches that is sburb</span><br />
[13:40:37] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: who are you</span><br />
[13:41:20] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: or is it like a scenario where 'if you tell us who you are you cease to exist' sort of deal</span><br />
[13:42:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: naw</span><br />
[13:43:25] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean time is kinda weird, so maybe "future" isn't really the best term...</span><br />
[13:46:03] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:46:15] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: seriously though, fuck time travel</span><br />
[13:46:15] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ye?</span><br />
[13:46:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: its nuts</span><br />
[13:46:23] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: huh.</span><br />
[13:46:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: and confusing</span><br />
[13:47:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: since the way sburb does it means we either don't have free will or the universe isn't turing compatable.</span><br />
[13:47:31] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: so uhh...do you have an equivelant here in our side</span><br />
[13:47:38] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: just curious</span><br />
[13:47:39] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I think so.</span><br />
[13:48:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: He had the username of forgottenLord when he was over in our session.</span><br />
[13:48:29] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ...was he a lord of blood that somehow died</span><br />
[13:48:59] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Erm, yes, he got vaporized by my denizen, which I guess was also his denizen?</span><br />
[13:49:12] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ...oh</span><br />
[13:49:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (denizens should /not/ be able to escape the scratch, even if its just uploaded memories.)</span><br />
[13:49:42] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ....good news I guess...he's still here? albeit...a robot now?</span><br />
[13:50:03] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
[13:50:10] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Soul Bots.</span><br />
[13:50:18] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...has he gone insane yet?</span><br />
[13:50:27] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: shrug</span><br />
[13:50:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#688e2e">CURRENT stealthyCalligrapher [CSC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[13:50:32] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...depends on the definition of "insane".</span><br />
[13:50:38] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: he's...out there</span><br />
[13:50:49] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: and he's a very flimsy robot</span><br />
[13:50:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: started trying killing people kind of insane.</span><br />
[13:51:21] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: well he did kinda want to kill one guy</span><br />
[13:51:28] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: maybe two</span><br />
[13:51:36] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
[13:51:36] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: but that's it, i think</span><br />
[13:51:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Did /those/ people kill anyone, or is he the one thats actually nuts?</span><br />
[13:52:04] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: one of them did...</span><br />
[13:52:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Okay... and the other?</span><br />
[13:53:02] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: not sure</span><br />
[13:53:15] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:53:24] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: i don't remember if he did really want to kill them or if it was another guy that did</span><br />
[13:53:38] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Right. My guess is it may be insanity caused by sensory deprevation.</span><br />
[13:54:34] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: say...is there an equivalent to some of us over there?</span><br />
[13:55:44] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Okay... what are your names?</span><br />
[13:55:56] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: Uh...Raine.</span><br />
[13:56:42] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Lets see... one of our friends had a roleplay character named raine, but thats as close as I know of.</span><br />
[13:58:22] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: wel..umm</span><br />
[13:58:33] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Plus she kinda died</span><br />
[13:58:34] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: *well))</span><br />
[13:58:40] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: what.</span><br />
[13:58:55] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So if that was a match... sorry.</span><br />
[13:59:12] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ...what was her name.</span><br />
[13:59:15] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Kat.</span><br />
[13:59:19] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW: ...</span><br />
[13:59:31] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">WHAT.</span></span><br />
[13:59:48] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: oh no that is not a good color</span><br />
[13:59:51] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ........</span><br />
[14:00:00] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: no, blue!FL. no it is not.</span><br />
[14:00:57] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Could you avoid blowing up my computer please?</span><br />
[14:01:17] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">WHY DID SHE DIE</span></span><br />
[14:01:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, its kinda hard to get them with alchemy not working and all</span><br />
[14:02:00] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: He bound her own life to a tree that was stealing the lifeforce from the planet we made.</span><br />
[14:02:11] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And said tree got burnt down.</span><br />
[14:02:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Again, sorry.</span><br />
[14:02:52] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">WHY THE FUCK WOULD THAT HAPPEN</span></span><br />
[14:03:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I don't know why she would bind her life force to it!</span><br />
[14:04:24] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">THERE HAS TO BE /SOME REASON/ WHY SHE'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT</span></span><br />
[14:04:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...plus we don't get dream bubbles, so... yeah</span><br />
[14:05:00] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Raine, I am not Omniscient.</span><br />
[14:05:37] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">WELL, WORK BACKWARDS, THEN. WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT.</span></span><br />
[14:06:18] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: It was months ago! I've moved on!</span><br />
[14:06:57] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">WELL I NEED ANSWERS, SO START FUCKING REMEMBERING</span></span><br />
[14:07:25] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I'm presently having to deal with a crack in spacetime that threatens to break wide open if someone even /looks/ at it wrong!</span><br />
[14:07:47] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...uuuuh, you didn't hear that</span><br />
[14:09:17] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">WELL, I GUESS I KNOW WHERE THAT ROBOT'S STUPIDITY CAME FROM.</span></span><br />
[14:10:05] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: AT LEAST HE HASN'T GONE INSANE AND TRYED TO KILL ANYONE!</span><br />
[14:10:47] <span style="color:#614c7c">CTW:  <span style="color:#ff0000">TELL ME WHO CAUSED THE FIRE.</span></span><br />
[14:11:39] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ohgogohgogohgog</span><br />
