<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#009b20">CTH: It's the guardian code, chances are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00d000">CPP: I know that... but it seems a little too obvious...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: guys, I need some ideas of what I should put on my x-mas list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: My parents want me to list 6 items for them to buy me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: chocolate orange, steam gift card, and some random thing from the What Pumpkin store are pretty much all I have on my list at the moment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I already have pretty much all the art supplies I could ever ask for mostly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I currently have too much clothes to even be thinking about new ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: and a legit copy of Earthbound for the SNES is probably out of the question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: probably, yes </span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: you played okami? </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: not yet, but for some reason I don't seem partucularly interested.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: no? shame, it's worth the buy</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: like it seems like it would interest me, but there seems to be some stupid filter that's preventing me from being interested or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: dunno if that makes any sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: well considering it's pretty akin to zelda in several ways, i don't see why you wouldn't like it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: maybe it's the fans that I've encountered over the years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ? </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: in high school I met some kids who were into that game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: and, I didn't really like them that much, but since we were all sorta outcasts anyways, it seemed logical to hang out with them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I know, it's a stupid reason to mysteriously be uninterested in getting a game that should theoretically be awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: and yet, I'm thinking of putting Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 on my list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i actually still have that for my gamecube</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: and I still remember the cheat code that unlocks pretty much everything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: Backdoor, I think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: that shit was hard long ago, but i've mostly mastered the score system for the neversoft thps games</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i dunno, been too long</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I remember the Suburbia level where you had to find that key for that one guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: anything after when neversoft closed up sucks ass now :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: and you had to find an axe or something and it unlocked that section of his house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: oh, behind the haunted-looking house? </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: heh, yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i still like underground better though </span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: and american wasteland</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I remember never being able to get past the last part of the focus training with the chinese guy in that game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: no mater how hard I tried, it didn't seem to work correctly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I remember tryingto make my guy lok like Ash Ketchum</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: in underground? </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: American Wasteland</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i didn't actually own that, i just tried it for a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: You know how they let you stick decals on hats?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: lolwhut? </span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: I was able to make Ash's hat by covering up the mountain in the Quiksilver logo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... pffft</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: so, I got 2 spots left on my list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: what's something medium-large but somewhat cheap?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: a plushie? </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: hmm... but do they even have any cool ones in stores or whatever?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7dfa">CSJ: (also, I make my own plushies most of the time.)</span><br />
