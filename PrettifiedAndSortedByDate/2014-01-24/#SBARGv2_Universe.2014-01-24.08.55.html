<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((take a chillpill))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((starting a server is really simple once you're nerdy enough to get all the settings right the first time, it's not like you're asking CP to hack into the pentagon for you))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I sorta figured that it was getting in the way of your work, since you mentioned a couple times that you can't do your codingwork and run the server at the same time because of java shenanigans))</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((coords are (x, y) or (x, y, z) ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((though I've noticed a fuckton of arguments about whether or not Y is the vertical axis in 3D space (imo, yes it is)...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((in my opinion x and y should be the 2D coordinates always))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but the order of axes is pretty much universally agreed on))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((and z is 3D coordinate if you add in a third dimension))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((that is, Y is always 'forwards/back' and X is always 'left/right'))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((because that's what I generally use the plane for.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i personally consider y up/down and x left/right))</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((I consider it that too but I only work in 2D so it's the "same", when I rarely have to do something in 3D it's forwards/back))</span><br />
