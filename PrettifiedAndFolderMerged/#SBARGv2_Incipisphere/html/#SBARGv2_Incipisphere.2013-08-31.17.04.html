<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what else is new.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: basically</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: an odd way of doing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: um</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: did they get it to open?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: NOPE</span><br />

<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: My new title is Slyph of Blood. From what we've gathered its my duty to heal relationships.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and shit like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: welcome to being a Blood player cocksucker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'd be okay with it if it was more literal. Like, pull of some avatar moves and bloodbend people.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cry more</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i was a Blood player the entire time</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: i like time better</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and i always felt this was more of an olive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but that could be a result of strifekind for pChum</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Lime, olive, same difference.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, DS, I don't like how you handle that aspect at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: poorly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause everyone sucks dicks at time travel and stability</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I was gonna say- yeha</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe it's just because I'm kind of a snob in that respect</span><br />

<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i've set up plenty of stable shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: aka nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause i need SJ to give me the low down on how this fucking shit works</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: future me is doing rather fine though</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I can't wait until you have to deal with a Doomed counterpart. That should be interesting to watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you mean a corpse?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've dealt with that one before. it sucked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and that would require me to ever fuck shit up and have to die as a result</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: 's not always a corpse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Oh and I'm /sure/ you'd never do that, huh, Mr. Perfect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: you mean time dialation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: remember shinjiggly? the doomed version of me who had to prevent a frog from energydrinksploding?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i'm doubtful that it'd be as awful as you make it seem to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: SJ do you want to take that one, or should I?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you can have a turn to talk</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a key to look for in a room full of pointy things</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what are the pointy things made of?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Metal, as far as I can tell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno. They're pretty sharp though</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: If someone is gonna pull out a magnet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: magnetize it all or something like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: maybe the key will stick to it</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Hopefully</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: that, or</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: an entire pile of sharp blades will be heading their way</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Hey SJ, how good do you think they'd be in alchemization?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i don't think anyone has a magnet that strong</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: 'youd be surprised</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: also</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: If they're any good, I wouldn't mind getting the code from you so I can use it on my pitchfork.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: If they didnt, how would a magnet that would pull the key out from under all that work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: What if the key isn't magnetic, but the needles are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: You'd only get needles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: set up the magnet away from you and then turn it on</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: knowing our luck, probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: again. i just said to magnitize the needles</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not pull out a huge fucking electro magnet</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: That could be a possbility</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: THATS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Okay, but if the key is tangled in the needles, moving them wouldn't do any good. Move the needles and the key just goes with them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: whatever you say buddy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Okay, so its pretty clear that my first act as Sylph of Babysitting is to make sure Mr. Snarkypants over here plays nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: good luck with that</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'll leave luck to SJ. She needs it more than me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, what's going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: SJ should have most of the luck now, considering</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, luck can go either way</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: only if you fuck it up</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: like how "luck" can mean either bad or good luck</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: light players make huge gambles</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's the set up that pays off</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if they didn't set up or miscalculated they're boned</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like how Vriska miscalculated Terezi's abilities</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: got her skewered</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I doubt SJ plans on killing any of us anytime soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not the point cockbite</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: pay more attention to what's being said and i will keep some insults to a mininum</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I didn't think that was possible for you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no, she got own'd because she wanted to go after the current bad guy like a complete idiot, which would have screwed up an important timeloop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and she didn't account for Terezi knowing this and being able to act on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: One day I will tell madamn web that you think that she is cute, and wants to date her, if you don't stop being a jack ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it was a miscalculation</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who in the razing dicks is madam web</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: My Wizard consort- a car sized spider.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: o</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Sic her on him anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: no wait i recently read it again and they both knew everything that was going to happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they played with their cards up</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: vriska was gambling on terezi not being able to go through with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: dont dont most spiders just eat-... okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why would you risk getting your fancy consort friend killed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Are you saying you'd kill a consort?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>SE, I once saw madamn web manhandle a  fucking t-rex sized raptor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: are you suggesting i'm not capable of killing in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you sure it wasn't a t-rex</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I only have science raptor prototypes, SE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: just checking</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: No, but to kill an innocent game constuct is a bit much, don't you think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CFF: One day I will tell madamn web that you think that she is cute, and wants to date her, if you don't stop being a jack ass.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ????</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: You're god tier it wouldn't even phase you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who the fuck told you that</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Being a dick isn't grounds for permanent death last I checked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it is when quest beds aren't working.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: NC, don't assume. most of us haven't ascended yet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Oh, so you're aren't GT then, Mr. Big Talk?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: any other questions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: any luck on the lock?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Theyre finally moving</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and the fucka ma thingy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: i have a new sword</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Some terminoligy you got there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's the wrong fucka ma thingy</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the other fucka ma thingy</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: It might help if you used actual words.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they know what i'm talking about jackass</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'm a jackass now? Really moving up in the world.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sorry to get your hopes up</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: jackass is under cockbite</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: SJ, can I get the captcha to those hella sharp needles you're messing with? I'm gonna need a new pitchfork here to move all the shit comin out of this guys mouth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll see what I can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: gonna need some big needles</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wouldn't it just make more sense to grab a pitchfork and then use it's code on the alchemiter to make a bigger one though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: The sharper one goes through skin better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm getting the sense that being a manuer shoveller isn't actually on your list of life goals</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I found some needles. they're about the size of pencils but way sharper and a bit thinner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Wow, someone make this kid a Mind player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Those will be perfect SJ. Thank you very much.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sarcasm really is dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: :I</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dedn't type out the whole thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, never mind, got it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so you haven't found the paradox machina?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Out of curiosity, does anyone here know what it actually looks like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: go figure</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i thought ornis mentioned it was in his basement though if that helps</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: makes it sound like you're playing binding of isaac</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we're still getting through the basement</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: So you're gonna just break everything in his basement until your claspecs switch back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that'd be silly</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: breaking it could make it worse</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda busy, something's attacking</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they're meant to /use/ the machine to switch them back</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kill it then</span><br />

<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: That would be the obvious course of action to take, I'd assume.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'm amazed that you haven't been somehow elected our 'fearless leader' with such insightful ideas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the reason is pretty obvious actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i /kinda/ hate how fucking stupid you all are</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: And here I was thinking it was your ego.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Gentlemen, ladies, really</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're all equally awful</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Exactly</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: But at least I'm not rude about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's nice to say that sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but when i look around. i see a lot of idiots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Are you sure you're not in a hall of mirrors?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ah yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: because a hall of mirrors would have such a physically varried group</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: You just said you saw idiots, you didn't make any mention of their physicaly traits. Though I'm not surprised.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ._.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i didn't think i would have too. it's pretty obvious when a person refers to a group that they wouldn't look the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: You seem like the type who doesn't really care to remember anyone if you can't exploit them to your needs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The only thing this place has in common with a hall of mirrors is a stark limitation to two dimensions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Well then SE fits perfectly in there, doesn't he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Dude what is WITH you and trying to turn everything into some kind of dig against SE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: actually i tend to think of myself as a third dimensional character</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause his personality grates with mine?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's probably got to do with him not liking people who don't care about most others</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Or because you're a huge fucking asshole who doesn't know when to keep his rude comments to yourself?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so he maybe he feels vindicated in attacking someone else?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: It seems to be the only way to get through to you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you've been fairly rude yourself for the pass while</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would it be characteristicly idiotic for me to mention that perhaps maybe putting down other players isn't going to help anyone, no matter who's going around slinging burns?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: :I</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i would like to say yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because I'm pretty sure I'm included in the group when the group is called stupid.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i don't like them. i don't care. we all know that i know i can be an ass and i have an ego</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not like that's any news</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: So why are you even attempting to work with us if you hate us all so much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the only difference in you and me right now NC is that when you're sitting here being an ass to me is that you feel like you're somehow right</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: only you're not</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're just another asshole</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the answer is that i happen to know what is happening</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: being uninvested in the people does not mean i am uninvested in the world around me</span><br />

<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Then please, enlighten me.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Just a thought, but do you think we can use the machine on Chronos? Like, replace his time/space aspect with something less threatening?</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: yup. Basement of the meteor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: considering that isn't a class that may be an issue</span><br />

<span style="color:#bacafe">CSJ: yeah. in a room completely of the cursed color.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: But giving him a master class would be better?</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Just stick him with something pointless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Like Sylph. He can heal dickbutts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and what would that be?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: aw. ono</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but then he'd be able to heal your butt hurt</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: And here I thought you were gonna finally play nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i like to believe you can take a jab</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Anyway, I don't think it would work anyway. The dude's a living glitch. Worst case scenario, we end up giving him a third aspect.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kinda suck</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Especially if he gets something like Heart. We'd all probably end up with a brain-ghost Chronos.</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I saw him once in the memo a long while back.</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: 'e was kind of an asshole, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but he was already kinda a villain past then wasn't he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: He only got the "Villain" title when the whole thing with the dreamselves happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah. I mostly saw him when he was killing people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Not the best first impression, I suppose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: To say the least</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: So, do you guys think he's got any chance at redeeming himself, or do you think someone's gonna have to kill him to stop him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he travelled back in time to become chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, Samael got Sessionwarped, and Chronos...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wasn't that his deal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'm surprised nobody has tried to go back far enough so they can talk some sense into him and keep all this bullshittery from happening.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: i think all blood players switched to time</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even if something completely horrible hapens in the alpha</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently SJ and I switched aspects (Light &lt;==&gt; Time), iirc</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and going back in time to prevent samael from being chronos is on the list of stupid shit</span><br />
