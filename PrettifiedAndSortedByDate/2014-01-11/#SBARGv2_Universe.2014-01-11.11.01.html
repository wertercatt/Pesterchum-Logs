[05:21:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, I think that'd probably be fine. I was actually planning on streaming/recording it myself at some point...</span><br />

[05:24:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...speaking of MC, I /really/ need to get working on that PMTTYD texpack. I was hoping to get it done (or at least done /enough/) by the time Spigot updates and I can upgrade the server...</span><br />

[05:25:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, I've seen things like that. they're technically 16x since that's the absolute lower limit MC supports, but use "larger pixels"</span><br />
[05:25:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I still have a 16x texture pack that needs to be converted into a  resource pack. ➜</span><br />
[05:26:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it also needs more of the blocks and extra GUI thingies added in. ➜</span><br />
[05:26:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, word of warning though: Paper Mariocraft will be 128x since that's the scale the terrain tiles are that I ripped using Dolphin.</span><br />
[05:26:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so if you can't run full-scale OkamiCraft, you won't be able to use my texpack...</span><br />
[05:27:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I think I'll do a 16x16 using the entire nes palette. (but 4 colors for each block)</span><br />
[05:28:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember once I participated in an NES palatte texture pack challenge once. ➜</span><br />
