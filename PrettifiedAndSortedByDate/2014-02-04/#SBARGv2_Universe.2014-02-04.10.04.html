<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DAMN YOU SCIENCE!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I love you science.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Can I marry science</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Wait, of course you can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: That one guy married his robot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It was in the papers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, a naked singularity is a special type of ring singularity that is big enough that the gap in the center can be traveled through.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Like a Portal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Or specifically, a Trans-locational rift?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is theorized that it might be used as a wormhole, and quite possibly a form of timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, think that's what he's getting at...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I don't have my space physics hat on so I'll have to get back to you on that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell theres even an anime that goes into some being generated by a microwave combined with a cellphone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: In other news! That meteor I strip mined was hiding a very peculiar Ore Source I haven't seen in a decade or two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh? what kind of ore?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and a conspiracy involving CERN</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I might have to go mining again to see if more was produced ORE (hehe) see if I can reproduce it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It's called Nuklonium. It has this, mocha color to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It's a rare metal that is really only found in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is it going to give us cancer? Or is it deep enough in the island of stability that I don't need to worry?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Nope! its not nuclear or radiated at all!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, at /all/?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: AT ALL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Literally NO RADIATION.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: In fact it is known to nullify other radiated things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Or at least dampen it</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: IT IS VERY RARE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: AND VERY EXPENSIVE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...damn...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I can't believe I found some~~</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I need to make another mining expedition~</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I wonder if I struck lucky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: And by expensive I mean like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: A single pound of Nuklonium</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: costs approximately 18mil in galactic credits.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how much does a loaf of bread cost?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: 16 dollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: At least the good bread.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: You can get a loaf for as low as 4 dollars on some planets</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: All known Nuklonium weighs at about 3tons. 8 pounds of which has been turned into a statue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so a thousand times as valuable as gold?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is it more 2 thousand?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Guess how much I found.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you a trillionare?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I found 6 pounds of Nuklonium in that single meteor!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or are you only a billionare.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Aaaahhhh!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so only a hundred million credits.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Good enough!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: However.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I won't sell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so you could buy 6,250,000 loaves of good brea-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Invest?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I want to use this stuff ofr experiment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: for**</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, you should totally invest it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I guess I can shave off 3 pounds for investment...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Then when I find more I can pull in more cash...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: before gambit catches wind and decided to make enough to buy the entire universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Hehehehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: decides*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...she totally would, wouldn't she? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Gambit was the boy I met recently right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: The kitty boi?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit Flip flops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: She/he ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Gender swapping?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Interesting/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. Gambit's default (and original) gender though is female, so when in doubt, use "she" I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: If I recall correctedly, there were multiple gender swappers among you yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just two others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless we use potions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since magic is real and all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, not sure if we should really call it magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Actually I have questions about that woman that showed up and broke up that incident you were having a while ago. I remeber that they were a gender swapper and also caught their name but the rest is a complete mystery!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all, magic implys its mysterious or supernatural.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm pretty sure if we studied it, it might turn out to be a form of manipulation of physics at the quantum level or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Also that Doc guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: He kinda piqued interest but he was gone pretty fast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Pretty sure Shon is always male.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, Shon isn't a swapper</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: IB is though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I wasn't talking about Shon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and PK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: IB. What is IB.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: imagineBreaker, one of the owners of the bar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: IB is Mike. or Met.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: currently offworld</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Off world?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox'>http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox</a> Alright, so apparently I've lost access to my customize menu, and we found this page in my clock, so... going from there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It doesn't seem to be straight multiplication, since sometimes it goes x4 and x8... but usually x2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe it has something to do with square roots?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, 6 is multiplied by 4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...perhaps the amount of times its divisible by 2?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: x2, x2, x2, ^2, x2, x4, x2, ^2, x4, x4.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, that wouldn't work with the numbers other than 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's left number done by the thing to equal the right number.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, that second times 2 is also to the power of 2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: good point. 2x2 = 2^2.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 81 is 9 squared...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and 9 is 3 squared... but that doesn't fit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "resulting number" implies 81 is on the left...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... gotta figure out what the operation is there...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 81 is also 3^4, so... hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also, I'm thinking 2 /needs/ to be treated as x2 and not ^2, or there isn't a pattern.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 9 is 3^2, and it was multiplyed by 4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also going pseudo-afk, watching the Nye vs Ham debate thingy))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sorta thinking it might be square roots almost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, "how many times can you fit this number in here" times 2 or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the squares are when the left number is a multiple of four... and 80 is, but 81 isn't...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then why did 10 get multiplied by 4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit, "blackbox1620" is wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (81 x 20)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the number always seems to be multiplied by a power of 2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: even if its like 2^1</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  got disconnected --</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ??</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope. 6 = 24, but 6^2 is 36.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, 6x2^2</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is what I was trying to say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 8 seems to be special somehow...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...any ideas?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets just throw calculations at 81 and see what works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll try 81, 161, 322, 644, 1288, and such in that order.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, miss calcualted the second number.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 162, 324, 648, 1296 then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Aha!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox1296'>http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox1296</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and its a layer of puzzles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and this one just made it balls hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess we should keep track of this successful one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 81 = 1296</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or 81*2^4</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'll continue working on the puzzle once this debate thingy is over, I can't listen and math simultaniously))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see, 8 was the biggest number in the first thing... maybe the biggest power of 2 thats under 100?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but what is 64^2</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((FL, that means stop giving away the answer for at least a couple minutes))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I'M NOT GIVING IT AWAY. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((sorry...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((should I leave now?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...nope, the answer isn't 4096.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( No, join in actually. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Since I figure you might like it slightly. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, great. Now what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((but I'm not in the mood for math which doesn't really have a context))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( well when kimura gets back, you could ask /why/ we are doing this... IC. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((also, I'm sorta busy working on my completely useless action platformer))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, I am technically still here... I just can't math while someone is talking in my ear :P))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this puzzle is stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shouldn't 64 be the biggest result?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since its 2^8, and 96 was 3^4x2^4...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or maybe that last answer was a fluke.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... what /is/ the pattern, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyone got a clue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, what are you guys working on? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We think my account might be getting jacked again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, who's "we" here? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So right now we are trying to work our way through a puzzle to get to the bottom of this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, me and Kimura.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and why don't you have a better password on your tumblr account? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since I know /I/ didn't post that last post on my account.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, how many computers do you check your dash on daily? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its something noone would ever be able to guess... and just mine.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I know))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the question now seems to narrow down to this: who would want to be your computer in the first place? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: be on, you mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless you think its a rogue AI or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, typo ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: though the star... okay, now I'm really confused.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does this have anything to do with that 3rd person perspective thing that was recently posted on your blog? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how do you know? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: found the link to the black box page in the clock page with comments next to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, more like embedded in the id of the source.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we have 3266785 seconds until that timer at the way bottom runs out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, less.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doesn't really seem like much of a rush... then again, thats also what happened with another thing, and Kimura says he found the blackbox page before somehow...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just hope this doesn't end up like timesten</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((aaaa, I broke the memo by muting it, what do?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((how do I stop orbital mute lazor?))</span><br />
