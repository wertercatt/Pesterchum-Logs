<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I thought you were the Dick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...and in the dungeon all I did was throw myself into the tornado and nothing else in order to...steal its power, so to say...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nah</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: YOU ARE THE TORNADO USURPER</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Kind of my job description, being a Rogue and all...right?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you take and place it somewhere else, where someone can better use it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Thief's take their aspect for nothing more than personal gain</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're more like robin hood</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you move abundancies of your aspect around to help out friends who don't have an abundance</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: So by definition, you bring direction, freedom and wind to those who need it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yup. but in doing so, you take it away from those who have it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Careful who you take from! :-) </span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah...did that earlier when FF went nuts...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: most importantly your powers are based on selflessness. you do not act to help yourself, but to help others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: otherwise you invert to that of a knight of blood, and you are then exploiting the trust in which you know people may have in you to weaponize yourself and them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: fun stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ................</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: introversion is not healthy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ..........eh?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: understanding of your invert and being able to abide and work in balance with it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I think you have your words wrong...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah. introversion = inversion</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Heh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: still. not a healthy thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so you know. consider this and do what you will</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yadda yadda</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I might have had a...moment like that a while back...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm certain you may have</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's not like we all haven't</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: I'm not sure....am I being a good Knight of Hope?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you certainly exploit it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think it's important to remember who you are though. knight's don't have much of their aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but they're prone to making the most efficient use of what they have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and you definitely do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Who I am?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what, really. sorry :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's late and shit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Craaaaap</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: I dreaded this day</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh-oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I like being a Thief of Void ^_^</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Someone help, I'm being a normal teenager</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Thieves of Void are awesome. :-) </span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … /I'm/ awesome. FS needs to work on his Thievery.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Heheheh, well, when they're good at what they do, they're awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I think if anyone is good at what they do, they're awesome...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Prince of Hope?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i just mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: destroyer classes are scary man</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: yeah o.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Awesome doesn't exactly mean good or evil...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed they are. Quite scary indeed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: even the Bards!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Just awe inspiring...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: like everyone's all "omg Princes" but… o.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh! you're going for a more conventional use</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: owo</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: What I was a Bard?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yeah. Bards are the sort of class that no-one really gives enough credit, considering what they can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: What if*</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: then you'd be kinda spooky</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Spooky?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Bards are like the unsung super-villains.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Bard of Hope?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you'd invite destruction or destroy hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Allows destruction of and through their aspect, yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: invite destruction through* hope</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Oh, crap. Dang.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: What about Bards of...Doom?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Wouldn't that lead to a doomed session outright?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Gamzee was a Bard of Rage, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...destruction through Hope, I mean...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he acted as the Alpha, the one with the most determination to get something done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: He just sorta used his rage to muff up everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a doomed session is only one that wrongs predetermed events of the alpha, of which we do know what they are,</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: But did he destroy Rage itselff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Bards of Doom would still be nasty. they'd cause destruction by destroying fate, which is something a session requires to be comprehensive, or allow fate to destroy that which is around it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and yeah, he did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he destroyed rage when he allowed to be calmed down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or was, however you look at him and his character.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but the rage was destroyed and everyone was allowed to see a greater view of the worl.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they were no longer blinded and narrowed in thinking by negative emotion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Coooooool!</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Bards are nasty characters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: I think i'd be a sucky Rage player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What exactly does Rage deal in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...but in a sense...he also caused destruction in another way...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Rage itsèlf, limits, and pathways</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Rage deals in negative emotion, the narrowing of percieved possibilities, and actual anger and the sort.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Not pathways, but something like that-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...He caused John to prototype the harlequin which sent Jack Noir into a Rage which culminated in him transforming into Bec Noir and wrecking the trolls' session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like how Terezi believed she only had the two options of killing vriska or in letting her go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: when she had other options available, that she did not realize until after the fact.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: really? i thought bec caused that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm pretty sure it was Gamzee that put the subconscious thougth in John's mind to involve harlequins in his own life which led to him prototyping one that led to Jack going nuts about his uniform and blah blah blah Bec Noir...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...That was like...the whole thing that cemented him as being the Bard of Rage...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: might've been explained during the green panels then</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i skipped a fair bit of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: gosh they were so hard to follow</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Bards?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: scary motherfuckers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...No one is doing themselves any favors by skipping anything in Homestuck...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Prince's to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...but yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...agreed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and i know, i just couldn't follow with it at the time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How many Bards/Princes do we even have in the Session rn?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SJ for Prince.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: :I</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Like 5</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Don't think we have any Bards</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Almost no bards, from what I know off hand,</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CP, got yo list?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I know MP, SJ, and IP are Princes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: There,s CA, SJ, IP, MP...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Can't think of any Bards tbh go figure. Oh yeah! CA!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: CA is a prince as well- yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ONE Bard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Two Times, a Blood, and a Mind. Who</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ^lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … idk of any other destroyers so yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: I thought Athena would make a owl joke heheh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...bluh...it's really late...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um... repetitiveOverdrive, Bard of Space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I need to go get some sleep...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they're probably dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Oh, crap. </span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Night, Phil!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Night...</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: 1. Yeah, I'll edit that quirk in a bit or something... 2. Wait, I remember one more bard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CBB</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: reputableIntrovert. Was in the memo a total of two times. Bard of Mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it was either a Bard that was only here a short time, or one I never found out they were a Bard. /28/ players on my list have no classes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but most of them haven't shown up again</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so they're probably dead at this rate</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: oh well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: hmph, maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: probably good that they are really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the session doesn't need anymore destructive forces as is</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeeeaaah :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who do we have in here right now anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Bluh of Blood, Mage of Blood, Thief of Void, Knight of Hope, that one guy WE, a Denizen [don't know the player's shit], </span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Knight of Void</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: With of Light</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: It's on CP's list, but the player was being stupid about it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this is true</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah, i'd be willing to throw classpect shit out at will if anyone wants though</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well we'll be finding that out as Page's are more explained</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think so</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: From what I've seen of him, yep~</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: 'Makes enough sense.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: BRAIN. GHOST. DIRK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a Prince</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably the recent potato</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Stillll</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it has to do with that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he's ripping her Soul apart</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Stiiiiiiiiillllll</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but that is on account of Princely powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a Prince of Blood could rip your friendships apart</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … and we /have/ one of those.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a Prince of Space could dismantal your leg</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a Prince of Time [got one too] could outright break time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: flat out /destroy/ it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [which is gonna be hella useful fighting Chronos btw]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a Prince of Life can destroy it with a flick of their wrist, almost no effort.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's a /Princely/ manner that you should fear</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not the matter of Heart</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if anything Heart is generally quite noble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anything else?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no seriously. i'm up for anyswering most any question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I'm even more curious about how a Prince of Blood would work now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well considering we're in the middle of watching a Prince of Heart tear someone's soul out, i'm willing to bet it's something similar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: What's the social aspect of a Knight of Hope? I feel like I suck at that too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: breaking bonds between people, or using those bonds to FUCK SHIT UP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well that depends on the player really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: social aspects are awfully personal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i'd say you do good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean. you only have so much hope man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … what's a social aspect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but you do your best at always putting on your smile and trying to ease your way through everything with a positive attitude</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and it's how his classpect affects/is affected by his social activites</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [i assume]</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7c37">CPO: Yeah. And, cool! Heheh</span><br />
