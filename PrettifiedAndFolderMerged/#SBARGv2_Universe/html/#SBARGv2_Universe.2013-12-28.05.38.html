[03:35:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Little bit of trivia</span><br />
[03:35:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if you see it in a cloud its gonna happen</span><br />
[03:36:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or... if SJ gets a Time Note saying the charred corpses thing happened and doomed things...</span><br />
[03:36:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or you cause a doomed timeline</span><br />
[03:36:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It could have very easilly been the clouds showing a doomed timeline. </span><br />
[03:36:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ has no reason for the notes anymore I believe.</span><br />
[03:36:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so I guess I'll just be paranoid over if its gonna happen or not</span><br />
[03:37:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, in the very least I bet I could delay it a few million years.</span><br />
[03:37:58] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: showing an ALREADY doomed timeline. Besides, almost anything could happen in doomed timelines. I would not be surprised if there was one where nak was the most dangerous thing in the universe, for instance. You can't just lock yourself in, due to paranoia.</span><br />
[03:38:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I bet even if it did happen someone would go back and lie about it to get me out</span><br />

[03:39:59] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: for pete's sake...</span><br />
[03:40:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok FL, here's an idea. if we ever find out that we're /already/ in a doomed timeline for some reason, what we'll do is deliberately set things up as accurately as possible to that cloud vision, take a photo/video as proof, then give it to whoever goes back to avert it.</span><br />

[10:59:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or something</span><br />
[10:59:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: isn't that because Gambit can flipflopbetween genders at will or something? ➜</span><br />

[11:09:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: did you see the q-craft spotlight?</span><br />
[11:09:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe as a deterrent from being doomed to falling forever, after 6 consecutive realm-hops via void, it starts dealing damage? ➜</span><br />
[11:09:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no? other than the ocassional Minecraft Files episode, I don't really watch MC videos anymore...</span><br />
