[09:02:57] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: What do you mean?</span><br />
[09:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (you should likely ask Ash about that one)</span><br />
[09:03:11] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: Oh, I know. But she's got like fifty moirials, so.</span><br />

[09:05:17] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: Why?</span><br />
[09:05:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Because I couldn't stand the thought of telling your daughter.</span><br />
[09:06:06] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: You wouldn't have to tell her anyway.</span><br />
[09:06:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Because when she grows up, she would have asked.</span><br />
[09:06:29] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: She's growing up super fast.</span><br />
[09:06:35] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: She's already like three.</span><br />

[09:08:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, I was hoping to help with the space exploration, but I suppose I could stay here and act as mission control.</span><br />
[09:08:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: After all, there was the... incident when I dropped you off at the bar.</span><br />
[09:08:51] <span style="color:#baba00">AE: Mission control? I'm asking you to be my moirail. I can void through space.</span><br />
[09:08:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Which I already mentioned.</span><br />
