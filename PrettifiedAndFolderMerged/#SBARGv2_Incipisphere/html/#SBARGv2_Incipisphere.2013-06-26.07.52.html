<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm. kinda short, but interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure that it's just training for use of a single technique.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or are you now stuck, after looking at the sample image?</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Anyone know any high-tech energy sources?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Mr. Fusion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup. in fact, I think the base game actually teaches that method... either that or I'm thinking of the Portal Prelude mod from years ago</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's that, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhe whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Your thinking of Portal Prelude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, the Mr. Fusion!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: From back to the future!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me find the code...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sweetness and light! How's it work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Garbage in, (like jpeg shit) Power out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's jpeg shit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, the stuff that gives artifact grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sbahj tier items like the Conksuck Boot and UNREAL AIR</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So those things can power a thing. Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we also tend to feed those into the replicator systems to get the raw atoms out of them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I sound incredibly ignorant right now, but how's that work, too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Star Trek tech.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Excellent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … yeah, can I have the code for that? Sounds useful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, it runs on technobabble I could try to explain but would epicly fail at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pretty sure DS has that one.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll just go back up.</span><br />
