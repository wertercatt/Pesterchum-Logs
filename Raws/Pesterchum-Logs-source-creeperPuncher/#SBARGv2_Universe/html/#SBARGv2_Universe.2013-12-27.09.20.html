<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: They wouldnt need to make the frog at least. Or deal with the black-king.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, at least they wouldn't be completely alone there. I heard some folks stayed behind. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: suuuuure</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either that, or-- actually wait a sec there couldn't be any more late entries, Skaia had hit its Final Form already...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: or what if they were there the whole time and didn't know there were other people :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, the incip memo isn't even a thing anymore. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: or Chronos</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then they probably died/went insane or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: so SJ, do you think we'd win against escaped gods from another session if that ever happend?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why would we have to fight them? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: well if they were from some war mongering people</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and decided to fucking take over the universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((hey niki do you want to rp cb waking up or))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...why? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: or do some other crazy bullshit like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -What a weird question to ask. It depends on the person and their sort of strengths, I suppose?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I think we'd whoop their asses no matter what, to be honest</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ballyards, if these people are even a thing, they're probably at most upset that you'd be stereotyping them like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: well since the universe is infinite</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: klingon session</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Besides, what drove you to think about that sort of question?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I dunno...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: started thinking about the sessions of this game</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and if players could potentially escape a session on meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay then, invite him to the memo or something))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I mean, its not really stereotyping</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: eventually there'll be some war mongering race that gets out of their sessin</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: *session</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's still kinda rude to assume somebody's going to immediately act like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and decides to fuck shit up</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((or we could just pm, let me finish up to where sl can physically be there</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: well to be fair the universe is infinite</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and its pretty hard to avoid them immediately acting like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "oh noes, eventually unique groun number 3453 is going to be here, let's treat the next group like we would treat them, even if they're the wrong unique group" ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: you miss understand</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'm not immediately assuming they'll be bad, even</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mister understand ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'm just saying eventually it'll happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and eventually an invisible teaopt is going to collide with your face. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: which is pretty hard to avoid, to be perfectly honest</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *teapot ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: it probably will</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I mean we live forever so we could pretty much see every possibility happening at some point</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'm sure i'll have more than one invisible teapot collide with my face</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not only did you not get the reference, you also completely missed the point of it. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: infact it'll probably happen more than once</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you implied soon. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: you implied it</span><br />

<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: pretty sure there will also be good gods</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: who escaped their session because, I dunno... it was unwinable</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. like a Beta Kids type thing, but instead of Scratching and heading into the Ring/Fourth Wall, they took the defense portals back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: personally, I might have done that had I thougt of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: if only because that came was a hell hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I personally would be interested in hearing tales of their adventures through an unwinable session</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'd be especially interested in how they came across the idea to hitch a ride on a meteor</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What would happen if the hero of time in the session died</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: nothing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: depends on if they were suppose to die or not. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm talking like perma died</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I mean, I guess it would be dreadful</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: in a /normal/ session</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: but apparently anyone can cause the scratch</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... I suppose the session would either continue to go on, or  if they needed to scratch, would end up being doomed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: didn't john do the scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In normal sessions you can't win if a player dies</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: need to brush up on my homestuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually FL, that's not exactly true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its why dave had to go back, hold on, let me get the quote</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he went back because John died /and couldn't get Jade into the session/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TG: what else is there to know TG: we lost TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then there was the entire deal with Aradiabots warping in to beat the black kind</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: king*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...well ok, maybe with a smaller group it matters more, especially if there's only one Spacer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 144 player session</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah. If the space player perma-dies before making the frog, then you are in trouble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: the spacer is needed to win the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, ours was around 100, give or take a baker's dozen. and we had plenty of permadeaths, and still won.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: remember when I died twice</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay it was a bunch more</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: portal 2 ref failed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think the only hard-and-fast requirements are that *Everyone enters *Everyone prototypes, unless it's a Beta/Alpha sitch *At least one Spacer survives long enough to make the Frog *Black King defeated before Skaia is destroyed</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its funny objects can't be doomed</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: there was actually a Sonic EXE hack</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but seriously, can this trial FINISH already so I can close the DR stream and /get going with things today/?!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also it was not good tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nothing about sonic.exe is good</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its kinda close</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gameplay is good</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: even if it does try to make sonic scary and it doesnt really</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill just send you a schematic</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Since we cant add it on like a wing we can always store it in the bay.</span><br />
