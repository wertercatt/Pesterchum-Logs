<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: an example of a terrible timeline\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i have looper\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh man, that movie. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: terrible example of a stable time loop\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: hey pk\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though it's a little inaccurate due to involving retcon-style time travel. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: oh we were just discussing on where we should start with teaching you about timeloops\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well it's a place to start at least\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. I just like to nitpick on stuff like that. Don't mind me. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: there is also timeline. which has a somewhat stable time loop\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, it's been crazy long since I've seen that one. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the terminator movies tend to keep a time loop stable if just becuase they are all destroted to prevent time from beening messed up too much\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *destroyed\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: where to start? well i guess we should start with the bacis\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *basics\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: forwards or backwards? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well it's simplest to explain it as a line first and then go from  there isn't it?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i'll get a chalk board and some chalk\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courageousScribe <span style="color:#c1bb10">[CCS]</span>  rolls a chalkboard from on end of the room to the center wehere everyone can see --</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok if i can just draw a straight line\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courageousScribe <span style="color:#c1bb10">[CCS]</span>  makes a line --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I'm guessing you guys are on mobile so no flash-based stuff?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok pretend this is a set of events starting with the birth of your grandfather and ending with your death\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ((on computer))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((well, the flockdraw thing lets you draaaawwwww))</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: ((im on computer too))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok the dark teal point is when you discover time travel and the dark blue is when you travel back to let's say when your grandfather is about your age\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: let's say at the green point you kill your grandfather\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the green spilt is the new futher you have made where you no longer exist\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: this is the standard time travel paradox for if you don't exist who goes back to kill your grandfather? no one which cuases and in the case of sbarg a doomed timeline since the paradox can not be fixed\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: in order to stop a paradox a simple fix for the universe would be for you to get your ass kicked by your grandfather meanting that you travel back to your time beaten up but your grandfather is still alive for you to be born so that you can go back get your ass kicked and live out the rest of your life\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or get your butt kicked by your futureself ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that works too ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: another way to keep a paradox from happening at that point is for you to have figured out that before you killed your grandfather you father or mother was conceived before you did meaning you exist for you to go back and kill your grandfather\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: make sense?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, as long as the babby that is one of your parents is still an end result, it will turn out fine. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hopefully ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog, I just remembered that one futurama episode... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: now in the case of sbarg to prevent doomed timelines we set up what are known as stable timeloops\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courageousScribe <span style="color:#c1bb10">[CCS]</span>  draws another line --</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: for a stable time loop let's say you go back in time at this point\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courageousScribe <span style="color:#c1bb10">[CCS]</span>  draws an x --</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: for it to be a stable timeloop you would have to have seen yourself doing an action let's say in this case you make yourself breakfast\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: this is a stable time loop becuase you make sure that an event happens by going back and event that already happened for you but with you on the other side\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in a way it's sorta like taking out a loan that you have to promise to pay back with your actions. ➜</span><br />
