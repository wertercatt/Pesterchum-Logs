<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT diludedAncestry <span style="color:#002f00">[CDA]</span>  takes off into a sprint, turning around and flicking his wrist, identical metal balls appearing between his fingers.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT marshmallowVirologist <span style="color:#dba521">[CMV]</span>  stays on the GRRROOOOOOUUUUND. she ain't part of your systeeeeem... --</span><br />

Just a bunch of footprints in the snow leading off into hundreds of different markings in the snow, they almost look like snakes slithering. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT marshmallowVirologist <span style="color:#dba521">[CMV]</span>  she's pretty much where she got stabbed. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT marshmallowVirologist <span style="color:#dba521">[CMV]</span>  is healed by...fire, woo. Warmth always helps. She's still stuck in a rut of shock, rethinking her entire life. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: why did he stab me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I think he's kind of a dick.</span><br />

<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i don't even think this was a dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you think it was just a trick to release Loki? like, the hologram-bug was /guarding/ him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: if not the bug then the statues.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So they were trying to keep /him/ in, not us out...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or, maybe a little of both truthfully</span><br />
