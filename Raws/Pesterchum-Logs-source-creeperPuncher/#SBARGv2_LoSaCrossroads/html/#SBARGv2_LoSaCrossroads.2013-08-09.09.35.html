<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .../Chronos'/ party?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Not... /that/ tea party... right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: Perhaps not a tea drinker, but perhaps a person who'd like to witness a true act of our most lovely antagonist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((ffs NOW?!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ... Oh /joy./</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((fjasfljaslfj))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have a rule against witnessing acts of antagonists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((A LITTLE WARNING WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE))</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: In that case, continue as you please.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...That stupid tea party...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: oof...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What is it Rob, you're usually decent at summing things up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: this is stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: But given the more volatile nature of our corrupt friend, deaths may follow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch. I'll give that guy points for dedication... trolling with a tea party is, somethin' else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: With that said, have a fine day!</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: A tea party.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Okay. I just know that EQ is gonna head over to the tea party. Because she is stupid like that/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's probably...carry the one, subtract the four...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well. What to do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Can't exactly leave 'em here... Nor can I just ignore the tea party.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What /is/ the tea party?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Dammit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: A thing set up by chronos and elsey. He said that if it happens, he won't kill people for a little while (which is total BS, but you cant exactly say no, given the cirumstances.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: So yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: He hasn't killled...anybody yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a rather empty threat, isn't it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well... considering he kinda has FI on a leash... and that he is extreamly deadly on his own right...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah deadly to a bunch of sleeping idiots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: All in all it's turning into Napolean Dynamite: the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I don't know if I should go or not... considering I'm the escape plan if the tea party goes wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...So how is this gonna go...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch...Of all days, Char's thing, now this, and we haven't even gotten to Fi yet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I ain't going.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm going home, waiting for when Fi needs to be saved.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Way to tell me the favor, but I could carry them somewhere.</span><br />

<span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Just go and blow up the field, and get us in the magicant.</span><br />
