[08:27:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So that leaves you with slightly over 4 TBs</span><br />
[08:27:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and thats not much... if you put movies and stuff on it.</span><br />
[08:27:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: which is more than the average person would ever need unless they want to play fucking crysis in their head</span><br />

[08:31:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However if you have enough harddrives you can cloud link them for a massive ammount</span><br />
[08:31:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that takes a bit of time to run.</span><br />
[08:31:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You aren't gonna be running minecraft from them, thats for sure.</span><br />
