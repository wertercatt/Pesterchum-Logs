<span style="color:#225604">CCP: wait what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not a whole lotta nude afterlives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I went to the 27th and it was freezing though, that was a weird quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Kihihihihihihi. FL will never ▲rrive in the GΘlden L▲nd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how many afterlifes are just a black void of nothingness?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I helped a guy get along to Valhalla too, that was a legendary quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not a whole lot!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you know how many dead people there are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: A lot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my luck just sucks then</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that sounds fucking rad. valhalla.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So there's like, at least 50 deadworlds I know about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least, for the first time I died.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just full of dead people! Afterlives for days.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or eternities.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one last week I got to spend time as a ghost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well then do something important. earn your keep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: until Kimura put my head back together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably because you had unfinished business, or didn't do anything to earn it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you just haven't ~believed~!</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu. K▲t might be in the GΘlden L▲nd...Uuu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i hope so, elsey</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Is Kat dead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: charles killed her</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Aw man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles you're a right cunt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, at least I now have /scientific proof/ that ghosts exist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what are you talking about charles</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man, I hope you don't get a deadworld at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i've been doing that for the past few years</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and you haven't been paying attention, have you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it was an accident, I didn't know that the trees would kill her when I burnt them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: good job nerdlord</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe that's why you're not going to an afterlife.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They know you'll just mess everything up or kill the fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (well I didn't expect my skull to be shattered by a tree branch either)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like 8th deadworld.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh man, I've never partied so hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: eternal party?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Eternal beach party.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh my god</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how much do I need to shape up to go there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a lot, that's for sure ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably xMillion, you're pretty much the Bane of Fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Remember Merlynne from the Session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The person who challenged us to BGO?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She was there</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: was Sam there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Iunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, no, he... wouldn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...great, now I don't know what to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean she was like a Muse of Fun so it makes sense /she'd/ be there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I should just let them move on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or I could finish the soulbots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: decisions, decisions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You should probably let them move on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're having a blast out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll finish the soulbots and then ask them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: does that sound like a plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: robots for holding souls?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, an awful one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: wow, why don't you do the manly thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and make a golem</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because I can't replicate magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Everybody knows dead people are supposed to stay dead, didn't you learn anything from the session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and if Kat had gone back to normal, I would have... asked her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so at what point do i get to punch charles into the deadworld of rotten eggs and raw sewage</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm not sure!</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: because he stinks</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'm sure it's soon!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Maybe I need to learn that other form of alchemy</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘT YΘU</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh hey Elsey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man I love these new weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, the other kind of alchemy leads to robot arms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Elsey, I'm sorry I killed your mom. I know a simple sorry doesn't solve it... but I can't fix it either, since I doubt anyone wants me to try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Literally nobody wants you to try I'd bet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: See I kinda left the planet so I could avoid death through stupidity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably a good idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I found so many awesome things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I'LL KILL YΘU BEFΘRE YΘU EVEN TRY TΘ VIΘL▲TE ▲NYTHING</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I'd be willing to help, if you're determined... because I still feel partially responsible through my absence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also elsey what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Seriously, got a nice scythe that can open up a deadworld.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that sounds rad</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean I hate these things since ethereal farm equipment gives me the heebies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you think losing most of my limbs would be equal in value to reviving a body?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But it's a neat trick!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, don't even think about it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, it'd likely be the /entire/ body PLUS a bit more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles you better sit your dollar ass down and do nothing before I make spatial change outta you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I could just sacrifice a bunch of fish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's just some things you shouldn't mess with. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or I swear one of your limbs is gonna be floating across space for an eternity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: YΘU'LL ΘNLY M▲KE THINGS ▲ K▲BILLIΘN TIMES WΘRSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: can you add a camera to that arm</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so i can watch armcam when i'm bored</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: //#define CONST_ETERNITY "until FL dies and revives next"</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe I'll sic some of the post-game bosses on him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, why is that commented out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not that I have any leverage with them but y'know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seriously, /what/ post-game bosses?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I /think/ its commented out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and FL, so it doesn't memo name.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You never touched the post-game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NV, THERE IS NO POST GAME</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: REVIVING THE DE▲D IS CΘMPLIC▲TED ENΘUGH WITHΘUT ▲ R▲NDΘM CH▲NCE ΘF EVERYΘNE DYING</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, I got a quest on that starter planet at the /very/ least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: didn't know there was supposed to be a post-game storyline. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS NOT A GAME ANYMORE</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well it's probably really rad whatever he or she is doing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...it never was a game in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: YΘU'LL ΘNLY BUMP THAT CH▲NCE UP TΘ 9000%</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if I do it on another planet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Will that lower the chance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's definitely really rad, and it's definitely still part game at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, there's a million planets of lore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: MOST righteous, brotha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: or maybe it's just happenstance that you're finding all this rad stuff and it's not even game stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that would be like. even cooler.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if I have a light player on my side?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘPE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And not bother using my luck stat at all?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since its completely and utterly broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe I'm just a super nice guy and I've been mistaking this stuff for game stuff this entire time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: yΘu existing ▲lre▲dy m▲kes everyΘne else's luck m▲gic gΘ dΘwn</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some of these things specifically boost my Space powers though, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (seriously I'm starting to think the luck stat is phychologically based.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (Which would explain it breaking)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: psychologically*</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i dunno, maybe it's just the way you hung out with that frog</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: maybe influencing the frog influenced the contents</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so one of the frogs made it so Crows are constantly pecking at my eyes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: totally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: .../great/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: maybe the frog just didn't like you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But y'know I don't think I can listen to Charles in all good faith</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Since he never actually left the planet probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i have a brilliant plan to make you immune to crows</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I left the planet!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been to two others!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And both of the consort moons!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good for you!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I tried to kickstart the space mission and it still hasn't done much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've been to like sixty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean it helps I can teleport around like a majestic astral fairy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, SPACE RACE TIME</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I left you in my cosmic dust.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think we already lost the race ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not if we /speed up/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heck, we don't even have space pens yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Doubt that's even possible against a Space hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gotta speed up</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu. Pencils.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ThΘse ▲re yΘur sp▲ce pens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: pencils?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Got a bone-hammer that shoots out little femurs that explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: the lead gets stuck in important equipment</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've never found a use for it, but it's hilarious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *graphite ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I've also been to the edge of the universe, which seems to be the error handling of attempting to flare back to a location back in the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well okay thank you miss smarty pants</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course I don't go there anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not since I droped that... /thing/ off there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: cr▲yΘns?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Meanwhile, you guys have seriously never seen a boss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I don't think so? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow, that's kind of impressive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're a pretty crazy bunch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have 12 "minibosses" in my mountain. At least, I think that was part of the plot of my land quests.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 12 in a mountain</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so that's what those snake consorts actually are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, they were actually experements.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember Dolos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember hearing about that guy ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: vaguely remember him as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, lets just say there was enough consort in those hybrids to actually get past the door. Not very powerful, but they are quite intelegent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And they can shapeshift, which you all know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sounds incredibly lame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well I mean, sorta cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I suppose that makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They are like... mini denizens I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the mini kraid in Super Metroid if you played it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: how's things on the ship, SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some of the ones out here are as tough or tougher than players</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright up here, same as usual ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, players right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some DBZ-tier fights compared to some mini-denizen consort things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I just like breaking Charles' balls it ain't a real pissing contest though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I've had to prevent them from making fusion reactors /twice/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but is there like, reasons to fight these bosses out there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah why don't you just tavros mode the bosses</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes it's to gain a new move or a weapon, but sometimes they want to destroy the world or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or they're doing some seriously bad things and it requires some mad player-power to stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The most recent one was toppling the Clockwork Regime by beating their boss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my plan to deal with a galactic empire is to throw Super Obama at them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then give him Obamanite so he Mega Evolves? <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But he has the chaos emeralds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That sounds like a really, really bad plan! But you're probably used to those.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I guess we could get the super emeralds in the mix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if we ever find that guy again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man that one was so rough I almost considered asking Rob for help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Where is he anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: turn him into Hyper Obama.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure at the moment ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he pops up every once in a while...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But he's still alive, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a guy like RS doesn't die so easily. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS is with us</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course he doesn't, he's a real man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Real men never die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On the other end of the planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well yeah I bet he's crying about Kat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: hey FL if you let me in i promise not to beat the crap out of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if I don't let you in</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what will you do then</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: then i'll beat the crap out of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously I can see a trick when its there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what trick</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i just want to talk about life</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Isaac, you will be the crap out of me regardless of my choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: beat*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Honestly, you probably have it coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so what's the harm in letting me in if you know i'm gonna get in anyways</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I don't even know who this Isaac guy is</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: might as well appease me, hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh, just a drifter</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Drifted to the wrong neighborhood, mate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I can tell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually it didn't used to be so bad, there were some genuinely awesome people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then the game ended and everybody either left, died, or became Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hes a dude from another universe that has managed to turn up as a roleplay on Beta Earths Internet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: you wot mate</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Other universes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i bet you're some dingy-ass porno mag character if that's the case</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I haven't even touched those yet, except that one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So where does that put SJ and Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: kimura? fetish porn</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: not sure about SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i calls 'em as i sees 'em</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Solo stuff, probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man, I forgot how much I hated the cold.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fuck I can't do a directed facepalm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: then let me in, nerdling</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ever been on a planet that doesn't rotate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: nah</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: must be real disorienting</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah it seriously is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did the Sun orbit the planet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, it's in your usual solar system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It orbits, but it doesn't rotate, it just drifts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's apparently the curse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tell me when you find a planet that a star orbits on the opposing side of the moon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or if you find a flat planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Can't say I've seen one of those yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'm on the trail of a CRAY CRAY tough boss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, tell me if you find a flat planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: hey, can you take me with</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think I've /heard/ of them, but you'd never get to one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: sounds like a neat boss fight</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you think you might need some help over there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Y'know, I might need some help in a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'll do the boring traveling stuff, it's cold as hell here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm looking for a specific gravestone on a PLANET of graves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Seymour Wie-- this isn't even a real person, who made this gravestone!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...if the planet's name is Trenzalore, I'm punching the writer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Kunis is the name, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh man i love seeing hilarious tombstones</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((changing locations seeya guys in a half hour or something))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hmmm alright I think this is the right stone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: now what</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((later SJ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now I find the secret door.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and all of them have a line of some sorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: be it a hook shot or a timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since a hook shot makes a /straight line/ to a target.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what about The Minish Cap</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: you fucking dunce</span><br />
