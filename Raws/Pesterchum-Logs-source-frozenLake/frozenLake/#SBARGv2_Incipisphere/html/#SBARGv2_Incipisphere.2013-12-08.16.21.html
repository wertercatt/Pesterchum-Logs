[04:25:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Because the nature of dealing with EQ and their respective denizen was to remain subtle and not to draw to much outsider attention, it remained unspoken and kept amongst trusted individuals who were either involved or needed to aid.</span><br />

[04:27:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Because of such, you have identified yourself as both volatile and unstable. Tell me, TV. Why would we include you when you have shown only to cause upset and turmoil?</span><br />

[04:28:25] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: either i'm involved or i'm continuing</span><br />
[04:28:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: You've shown to us your emotional and incapable of handling trauma in this sense. It is necessary that those involved can maintain both emotional stability and the ability to reason.</span><br />

[07:14:47] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yes and can the next break between our meetings be even longer a wait?</span><br />
[07:14:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "for realsies" ➜</span><br />
[07:15:11] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: for realsies?</span><br />
[07:15:15] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Oooh! </span><br />
[07:15:38] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Anyway, it took me about a day or so to rig up the thing...</span><br />
[07:15:49] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so I was in and out almost instantly</span><br />
[07:16:13] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I programmed the reality thingy to basically be an AU of Sbargv2</span><br />
[07:16:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .\</span><br />
[07:16:55] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so shit gets real, then stops getting real, then gets more real, then gets so fucking real that craft mayo isn't even that real, then it just ends</span><br />
[07:16:59] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and i'm here!</span><br />
[07:17:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you spend all your time on LoCaL or something? ➜</span><br />
[07:17:35] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Which planet is that?</span><br />
[07:17:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Land of Copper and Lasers</span><br />
[07:17:53] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh, no...</span><br />
[07:17:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it... kinda poofed.</span><br />
[07:18:08] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I basically just wondered around...</span><br />
[07:18:14] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: watched teammates get killed</span><br />
[07:18:22] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: watched them ascend</span><br />
[07:18:26] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: then get killed again...</span><br />
[07:18:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:18:35] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: it was kind of depressing, to be quite honest :/</span><br />
[07:18:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how much did I die</span><br />
[07:18:39] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but also fun :D</span><br />
[07:18:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:18:45] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: You died like... once</span><br />
[07:18:49] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and then ascended</span><br />
[07:18:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and now I'm creeped out.</span><br />
[07:18:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <a href='http://mastermoridin.tumblr.com/post/69435793768/somepretty-things-vvidget-chocolate-food'>http://mastermoridin.tumblr.com/post/69435793768/somepretty-things-vvidget-chocolate-food</a> ➜</span><br />
[07:19:04] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: why are you creeped out?</span><br />
[07:19:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, looks like it departed from reality...</span><br />
[07:19:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what? ➜</span><br />
[07:19:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1: Dreamself death 2: Ascention 3: CHAOS DUNK</span><br />
[07:19:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, because you really died way more times than that? ➜</span><br />
[07:19:45] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: There was like... a completely different set of circumstances</span><br />
[07:19:54] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: no Chronos or the blue hole...</span><br />
[07:20:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, you forgot that one picnic with AG. ➜</span><br />
[07:20:15] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Weirdest thing...</span><br />
[07:20:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh right</span><br />
[07:20:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FL ended up being the calmest person ever</span><br />
[07:20:32] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and never needed to get laid</span><br />
[07:20:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:20:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />
[07:20:40] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: not even once</span><br />
[07:20:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right, I think your reality was busted</span><br />
[07:21:09] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Well it wasn't meant to reflect perfectly</span><br />
[07:21:11] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: most people were different</span><br />
[07:21:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: except strangily CP</span><br />
[07:21:22] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: CP was exactly the same</span><br />
[07:21:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[07:21:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what do you mean by that?</span><br />
[07:21:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps it was trying to reflect a realistic session, but all it had was your memories?</span><br />
[07:22:24] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yeah, maybe...</span><br />
[07:22:32] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: anyway, I think I know what SE meant now...</span><br />
[07:22:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What did I prototype in this... "AU"?</span><br />
[07:23:12] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: a cat and your dead grandmother, I think?</span><br />
[07:23:19] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: You were calling it grandcatsprite</span><br />
[07:23:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:23:26] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so either grandma or grandpa</span><br />
[07:23:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I don't have a cat, so this was vastly different.</span><br />
[07:24:02] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: The Black King was insane though, because someone I guess somehow had access to the first guardian who wasn't ornis</span><br />
[07:24:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh fuck</span><br />
[07:24:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, if I was acting exactly the same, then I still self-protoed with a plush Ammy toy and stuff?</span><br />
[07:24:18] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and someone else had access to the fucking horror terrors</span><br />

[07:24:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, was it the desu guardian? ➜</span><br />
[07:24:35] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes, CP</span><br />
[07:24:38] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: everything was exactly the same</span><br />
[07:24:47] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: desu guardian?</span><br />
[07:24:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FS: he said AU!me was identical to regular!me...</span><br />
[07:25:09] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: SJ was like... 10</span><br />
[07:25:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: old headcanon about the (fake) guardian. ➜</span><br />
[07:25:24] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: shit was trippy, I think it mixed my memories with a scenario I wouldn't be ready for</span><br />
[07:25:28] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh</span><br />
[07:25:32] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: it's an amusin<span style="color:#730e8f">g idea though</span></span><br />
[07:25:34] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I don't think so then?</span><br />
[07:25:55] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I really didn't put that much thought into the AU at the time</span><br />
[07:26:08] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: TBH I could have gone braindead</span><br />
[07:26:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:26:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did anyone use antimatter in the AU?</span><br />
[07:26:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since apparently I was calm?</span><br />
[07:26:31] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Ye</span><br />
[07:26:35] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and surprisingly</span><br />
[07:26:40] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: It actually worked</span><br />

[07:26:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: who used it though? ➜</span><br />
[07:26:53] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: CP</span><br />

[07:27:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: wha</span><br />
[07:27:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I knew about the SCP event.</span><br />

[07:27:51] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think EQ was much older...</span><br />

[07:29:14] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FS turned out to be evil</span><br />

[07:30:04] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: We also had to fight Hearts Boxcars who prototyped</span><br />
