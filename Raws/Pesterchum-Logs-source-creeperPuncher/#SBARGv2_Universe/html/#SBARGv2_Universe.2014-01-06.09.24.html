<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...How are things?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a theory about how to get them to work again, but it won't happen on /this planet/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I'm pretty sure about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup BB</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hi...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would you guys like me to melt a path?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...FL I think I know what your plan is, and the probability of finding one of the planets in this universe destined for a Sburb session is astronomical. ltierally.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Isnt this one destined for that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering my theory involves the existance of frog temples on a planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no DS, there's no First Guardian or Frog Temple on this planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, as you all remember, Alchemy is possible slightly before entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For objects such as perfectly generic objects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that has made me think about it, and I'm currently between two theorys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Quick question: How much has it snowed since last night?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: the town is covered in 20 ft</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1, That the Frog Temples create a "sburb field" around a planet allowing for alchemy to work... or 2, PARADOX SPACE IS BULLSHIT AND MAKES NO SENSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But its likely the first one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why can't it be both? <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm sure paradox not making sense is a universal constant...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it seems paradox space has been /trying/ to stay self consistant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: after all, the alchemiters seemed to work on the Troll Meteor during transit, far outside of both a universe OR a session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, but it was also moving in the furthest ring, which /has/ no stable physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, it is breathable to non gods, and also has no atmosphere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Otherwise the Troll Meteor would have slowed down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Due to hitting oxygen atoms that were in the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, at least the logic of paradox space /trys/ to make sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I feel like I'm spending too much time just going with the flow and missing out on stuff...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Ok the hill is done!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to try to find the bar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: I can just port yo there Charlie</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /try/, being the defining word.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DS, do /you/ know where it is under all of this snow?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right, space player sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shouldn't doubt it.</span><br />
