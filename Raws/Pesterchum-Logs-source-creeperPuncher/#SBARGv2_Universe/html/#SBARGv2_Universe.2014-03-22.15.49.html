[10:50] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am now less confused. </span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But before that I had a dog, then I cared for a bunch of wolves and dogs on LoFaR.</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So I ran a pack, sorta. Then I "inherited" two souls that look kind of like little balls of doge that were "heirlooms" from my mom.</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Before I went on a vision quest or some shit. It's all a very long and dumb story.</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I will take your word for it</span><br />
[10:53] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am finding the pack mentality of the wolf family to be interesting</span><br />
[10:54] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: The Dire wolf seemed to have been very much like huamns.</span><br />
[10:54] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((*humans))</span><br />
[10:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, interesting.</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: It makes me wonder</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: because the Dire wolf is extinct</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, I'm /still/ trying to sort my wolf instincts out, being one of the only ones around here...</span><br />
[10:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You just gotta yolo it.</span><br />
[10:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's how I learned all my instincts.</span><br />
[10:57] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Perhaps you two could form a small pack</span><br />
[10:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not I'm not a natural wolf leader.</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess my main problem is that a fair amount of instinctual behaviors conflict with human standards of dignity or something :P</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Such as?</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, territory marking, for one <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  apologizes for the mental image --</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Why?</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, because humans don't pee on things to claim them????????</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: No?</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Probably not</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: hwoever I have found a relevent quote</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I remember you shit yourself all the time though.</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like when 682 showed up.</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: "For man, the whole world is his bathroom"</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh... I still want to forget that day... not because of that, but because I went FL Tier.</span><br />
[11:05] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: FL Tier?</span><br />
[11:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: one word: antimatter. ➜</span><br />

[11:06] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: How can I deduce the meaning of the conversation with one word that seems far removed from the conversation you are attempting to clarify?</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: lol</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That was funny as hell</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I'll explain a little. ➜</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you know what happens when antimatter hits regular matter? huge asplosion. ➜</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Yes</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL kept trying to expariment with antimatter a lot during the session. ➜</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm pretty sure every single attempt ended in failure until he blew up his planet.</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he only used it a handful of times, but he talked about it like a girlfriend or something. ➜</span><br />
[11:09] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: fondly</span><br />
[11:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: My sides</span><br />
[11:09] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: understood</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, ➜</span><br />
[11:12] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: during that battle, Kim attempted to use antimatter against 682, and it didn't really work, somewhat thankfully. ➜</span><br />
[11:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE ANTIMATTER BOMB MADE HIM FART</span><br />
[11:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anti-anti-matter? I have no idea. ➜</span><br />
[11:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (is anti-anti-matter even a thing???) ➜</span><br />
[11:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anti-anti-matter is just regular matter though isn't it?</span><br />
[11:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: 682 adapts to most things that attack it, I believe was the cause.</span><br />
[11:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's what annoyed me about that one episode of Lilo and Stitch: The Series...</span><br />
[11:20] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: But it worked out well enough in the end.</span><br />
[11:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, true.</span><br />
[11:21] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This brings me back to my question from earlier</span><br />
[11:21] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: How is life for you players now?</span><br />
[11:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: flip-flopping between endlessly boring and impossibly dangerous. ➜</span><br />
[11:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what SJ said, basically.</span><br />
[11:22] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Odd description</span><br />
[11:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I've also been pestering people in other universes. recently talked to what seemed to be a Pre-Scratch version of Kat...</span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: waithwat? ➜</span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Really? Wow.</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. it was... really awkward for both of us.</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even though I didn't mention what happened to our version of her.</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow.</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's impressive.</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But my life has been actually pretty good.</span><br />
[11:27] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This is good news</span><br />
[11:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Besides assisting in the release of like, 6 ancient horrors.</span><br />
[11:30] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Oh?</span><br />
[11:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, besides that.</span><br />
[11:31] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Life seems to be a very interesting road for you players</span><br />
[11:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (("His sources include [blah blah blah], and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage." THIS SHOW I CAN'T EVEN))</span><br />
[11:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I honestly kinda fucked up.</span><br />
[11:35] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I believe you may be able to find a way to help yourselves through the issue</span><br />
[11:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's what we were doing at the Library today.</span><br />
[11:36] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Then you have already started</span><br />
[11:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually we got maps and a new lead! Which is nice.</span><br />
[11:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I still have your webcam Niki, recorded some good stuff.</span><br />
[11:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sweet ➜</span><br />
[11:37] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am glad that it seems to be going well</span><br />
[11:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't remember the name since I only saw it for a second but I bet PE has the lead.</span><br />
[11:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's good to hear</span><br />
[11:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So we'll save Gene yet.</span><br />
[11:46] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am wishing you luck</span><br />
[11:50] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am unsure if I would be useful by entering</span><br />
[11:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not, Iunno.</span><br />
[12:02] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Would it inconveniance you?</span><br />
[12:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no strong feelings one way or the other.</span><br />

[12:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, going to bed. goodnight procrastinators.</span><br />
