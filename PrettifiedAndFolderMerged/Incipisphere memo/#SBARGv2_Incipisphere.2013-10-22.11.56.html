<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why d'you call him Bats?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Because when I met him, I gave him bat wings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: He got rid of 'em, like a prat, but he's still Bats.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think he's mad that I got rid of them by form-swapping five seconds later :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Mad? Nah, but it was totally lame as fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, seriously? How'd you manage to do that, SR?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Whacked him in the head with a magic statue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I did keep the second pair of ears you gave me on the fourth statue-clubbing... they finally wore off this morning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … That why you had four ears or something, CP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Aye.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Wait, were you also responsible for him getting fleas?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Define responsible. He had fleas when I met him. I got him to face the issue, and gave him the flea collar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *eyetwitch*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Jeesh. Why do you have fleas, CP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Not up to date on his shots, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the only "fleas" I have are /the fucking spiders he dumped on me/!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: The fuck're you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ack, spiders? D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: You got /fleas/, Batsie, not spiders...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What is it with this Session and spiders why can't we have cool consorts for a change.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ono</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: my...consorts aren't spiders. </span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...my consorts are living bombs. how is that not "cool"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then… why do you have spiders? O.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: CP, you're the exception. :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: I don't remember the exact origin, but spiders like me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I know I'm the exception. I'm the only one with /non-animal/ consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's cool :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I like my skinks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Actually, I think birdboy's consorts are pretty cool, he has like dragons or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or hippie dragons just show up? I'm not too clear on that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Dragon consorts...they eat /everything./</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oooh, do you have those? :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And even the inedible things? o.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: I don't. A friend does. But they eat anything that moves. </span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Stay still and don't get eaten. Got it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Or run really fast. I mean, dragons are cool, but relatively not that fast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Well, or just stop being there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: And never. EVER. bring a dragon to a Space player's land. It just doesn't work. Unless you like eating frogs legs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: ...fuck. Speak of the devil, and he'll shit in your noodles. Gotta run.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, now that the second pair of ears thing has worn off, I can change form to human so I /can/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: collar removal kinda requires thumbs...</span><br />
