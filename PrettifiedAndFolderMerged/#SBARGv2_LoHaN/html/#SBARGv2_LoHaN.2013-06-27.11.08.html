<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you being overloaded with phoenix wright references on that drawing?</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: haha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: only reason I upgraded to 7 was because it came preinstalled.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Likewise.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is confused, what's so interesting about a wall? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  attempts to take a picture of the wall --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  scrolls through the menu for the picture --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meaning, like "8r8k H34DS", someone else must've done a three-letter pattern on their own room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks up at the wall, sure enough the writing is on the wall --</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is just sorta staring at it, almost not wanting to believe that it's even a thing --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks up at SJ. "you ok there?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...how long has this even been here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably for a while...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...and I didn't even notice...</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stands up --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that seems to be a trend among Sburb players. one or more of them vandalize their room subconsciously and never realize until the other players point it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm going to check something real quick</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sets a dial on her time leg to a couple of months ago --</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...it was even there during the 1st gate months...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can't check back any further than entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this thing won't let me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, too much interference probability.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That makes sense...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The not checking back I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it does, actually. it warps you in time, but NOT in space. so you couldn't warp to before entry because your house wasn't in the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Even a Space player can't cross The Boundary...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it usually warps relative to whatever I'm standing on, but I guess there's a hard-coded thing to prevent going back before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I actually only just realized that The Furthest Ring kind of has stuff in common with the Boundary...Funny, that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Blazblue time travel might have some in common with Sburb's, too. Bootstraps are a thing for it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  chuckles. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, what now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: In the Blazblue verse, the Boundary is like, the space between space. Or the space between time, rather. The varying timelines that Blazblue subscribes too are split from one another by it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, what do you guys want to do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the tour's pretty much over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hoo boy, if you thought Sburb's time travel was hard to wrap your head around Blazblue's is just mind-boggling.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Does anyone mind if I go Aranea-tier?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because I actually love explaining shit and providing exposition even on things I'm not entirely clear on myself</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: go ahead</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sure. I'm just gonna have lunch while you talk about whatever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah Blazblue's time travel is /nuts/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Actually its kind of tamer now that I think about it. Bootstraps are a thing but not to the ludicrous degree of Sburb...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The Boundary is the many mechanism that facilitates hopping back and those things are just sort of built into how things work...Alternate timelines are a thing, at least one character hops to one and actually uses knowledge gained from it to affect her native timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: One character becomes another, a figure of lore from years back. They're basically completely distinct, with their own personalities and existences.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's a lot more interesting then my crappy bare-bones makes it seem, ehehehe...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, uh, think it's safe to return to the cafe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll be sticking around here for a while though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok. RS, you need a portal back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess he fell asleep or something. mmk. see you later then.</span><br />
