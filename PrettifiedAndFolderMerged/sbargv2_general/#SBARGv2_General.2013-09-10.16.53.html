<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Dark Souls has bonfires as "checkpoints" if you want to call it that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: even though it's technically an open world</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh, open world? sweet</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: If your PC can handle it, get the PC version</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Also have a controller on hand</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: keyboard controls suck</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if theress a question of whether my pc can handle somethiing, i come down on the side of "probably not"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: MA, on that topic, do you know how to get a PS3 controller to work with gamepad-enabled steam games? apparently "gamepad enabled" actually translates as "Xbox 360 controller only" or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: is the ps3 version completely terrible? like i got the pc version of skyrim and thats pretty much the minimum for what will get me to choose pc</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also cp the ds3 tool has an xinput option</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: does your skyrim run at a decent framerate (decent being say 30 fps</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: motioninjoy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: )*</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah i think so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Motionjoy is agreed upon as a sucky option</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also i /do/ want that mod that changes the "you died" text to THANKS OBAMA</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well it /does/ have built-in 360 controller emulation so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: there's another option that i know of that's easier and works better in general, though i don't know personally as i don't have a ps3 controller</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL:   <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v81EvbBMe9o'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v81EvbBMe9o</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: and the thing i'm talking about does the same only you have less hoops to jump to do so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: <a href='http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller'>http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: see here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: also works on PS2 contollers</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: assuming you have an adapter for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: im fine with motioninjoy</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i need to play crypt worlds</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh right, I think I got that to use PCSX2 (which also allows for PS3 controller in Dolphin, oddly enough!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: if you use that you should be good as it basically turns the ps3 controller into an xbox 360 controller to the computer</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: and 360 controllers work on almost anything</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: also, something to note</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: PS4 controllers are already in work to be easier to use on PC, no external programs needed to play stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: so that might be an option in the future</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: also, surprisingly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Japan of all places isn't getting the ps4 until /feburary/</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i need to get second life for trolling</span><br />
