<span style="color:#980002">CMH: if you do, we'll never find out what happens ♥</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#980002">CMH: and that would be an even worse fate that dealing with the ending, i'd think ♥</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, there's at least FOUR ways Jade can survive at this point: Jane doing the Lifey Thing, Dave dooming the timeline, John doing his thing, or Vriska counter-8r8king the clock back to "not dead".</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: is that last one a thing she can actually do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: that, or the ring is stolen and given to Her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: And what even /happened/ there jesus back when it was an ambiguous independant thing it was one matter but now actual possible/probable influence christ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, this kind of is confirming the clocks DO in fact affect the Heroic/Just/Neither outcome...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT sbargv2Gamemaster [CSG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: It was a Just death because even though there was outside influence, Jade was evil enough to consitute the death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Unless I've missed a crucial part of the conversation. I am merely here to watch and moderate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, there's still the Lifey Thing and two kinds of time shenanigans to undo it, I'm not /too/ worried about it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>which is Bullshit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I'm just gonna be pissed if she stays dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (good luck with that room SL, it's EEEEEVIL)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: I am curious to see how this is going to play out. It is the first time one of the main eight kids has died a just or heroic death. John was killed but came back due to it being neither Just nor Heroic of a death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (I can't make an account on there for some reason, is why...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Have you registered with Nickserv?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and that's the problem there. for security reasons, I /permanently disabled/ Platform on my fb account. third-party logins are hardcoded-impossible unless I make a throwaway FB profile or something)</span><br />
