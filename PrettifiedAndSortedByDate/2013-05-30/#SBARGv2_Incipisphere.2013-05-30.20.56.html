<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Huh, really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...MG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ Yes? ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: jusτ don'τ..anger τhem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Picking you up in about 10 minutes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ Kay! ^_^ ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: You gonna love my new ride. Have you ever seen Macross?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: NO, BuT I'vE HearD OF IT</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: oh, I just remembered... yesterday, I levelgrinded moon quests (which is why I wasn't online), and got enough carapace rep to enter the basement levels of Prospit</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Wait...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so now I can go try to find what that mysterious note the other day was talking about</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I just thought of something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ Macross sounds familiar. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Can we just use the grist, without having to have any items preasant?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: say wha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well, <a href='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/VF-1S-Strike-Valkyrie-02.jpg/150px-VF-1S-Strike-Valkyrie-02.jpg'>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/VF-1S-Strike-Valkyrie-02.jpg/150px-VF-1S-Strike-Valkyrie-02.jpg</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's basically a trasforming Van-jet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Just dump specific amounts of grist into a 'cauldron' so to speak, and alchemize things that way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ Wow! :D ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: is that allowed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: AC, you don't actually need to physically have the items to alchemize. alchemy is literally just bit math.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Thanks for the tip, I just thought you had to use items...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep! where are ya in ya land, MG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: as long as you know a code and have the grist, you can make the thing even if you don't have the base items</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: No..</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I mean... just pore grist without a code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ At my house. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: KAy should be arriving in a minute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: SP, did you get that bootlegged copy of Con AIr?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: YeaH, i GoT IT</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: How do ya expect to make something without a blueprint? That's basically what a code is, it tells the alchemiter what to make!</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ I love that movie! ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I accidentely alchemized it</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I used a random code generator to get that code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Maybe somewhere out there in Paradox Space, there might be a "rainbow table" of codes that you could search through by grist cost...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Okay! You have permission to board, Skittles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: we could probabely find that on a FR server</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ Yay! ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Let me look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9d201">CMG: ~ Let's go! ~</span><br />
