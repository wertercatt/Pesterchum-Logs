<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yes. Back on topic.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so what is it that makes you different from them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Because I, along with some others, are interested and involved with you players. I have made a deal with you all, and for that, I needed to communicate.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but how?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how is it that we understand you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, simple. I've had plenty of time to study up on the english language. -And, like I said: We do have good enough vocal cords for talking, so it was really just... learning.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: How does speaking a language that only two beings can understand make any sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: when Echidna spoke to Jade she had a full understandingf what she said</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SBARG ISN'T PERFECTLY HOMESTUCK, NOW SHUT THE /FUCK/ UP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Its just learning another language. It takes time, sure, but it can be done. I could easilly talk in the way only EQ could understand, but that would not be very practical for anyone. It's not like I can only speak one or the other. </span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: untwist your goddamn panties</span><br />

I can't say that I like the whole "no explanation thing," myself.  But otherwise, it really is just a matter of languages for the denizens and players.
