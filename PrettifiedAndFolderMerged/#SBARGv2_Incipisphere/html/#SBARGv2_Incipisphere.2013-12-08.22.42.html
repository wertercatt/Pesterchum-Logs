<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ((that was meant to be IC))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm still trying to sort some things out. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wonder how my brother's going to handle it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I basically have no one to go with at the moment so if anyone wouldn't mind be tagging along with them, i'd appreciate it :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, the plan as I currently know it is for all of us to stick together for at /least/ a while once we enter, to make sure we all get settled on the other side...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's probably a good plan. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but what after that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then, we write our own future. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  translation: I have no idea. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: after that I just kind of have nothing to do and no one to live with :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: didn't really bother trying to make me friends through the session and HR is no where to be found</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, you don't have to be alone... for the most part, we probably will stick together even /after/ establishing a home...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i hope so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: it really amazes me how everyone's come together...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: from disorganized bunch of kids to one hell of a team in nine months</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (which btw it literally HAS been nine months since entry, or will be this thursday)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (whoa) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and then some people have gone from incredibly smart to completely insane</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I guess I shouldn't say COMPLETELY insane...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and some have just flat-out disappeared off the map. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: HR...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though those with the will to continue have thrived and done awesome things. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ((If i'm allowed to, I was thinking of doing a post game plot-y thing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ive gained everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and then lost it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so theres that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: come again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we were talking about how we changed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: meanwhile i've gone from being a kid</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: to a horrorterror-possessed sociopath</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: to a kid</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: to a fucking mental 20-something year old</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: youre still 13 calm yoself</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you didn't here? I spent like 10 years in intense AU...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you must not have been here</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but did you even take any lessons from those AU's? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did they teach you anything? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or did you squander the time away with your usual shenanigans? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: both</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so no lessons</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that's not what I said</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no it isnt</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you took lessons on wasting time? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: oh, I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: no, that's not what happend</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you could have just cookie clicker for that. :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dude its fine if youre still a kid</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: itll be nice bringing a kid into the new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: being put into a leadership position it was pretty clear nearly from the beginning that being an argumentative and aggressive ass wasn't going to work</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: it's not fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: leadership?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dude you aint in no leadership position calm yoself</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: the AU was designed to put the player into a leadership position</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: remember, I've been in an AU for about 10 years...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure it was 10 years? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: SJ, didn't I already explain this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshitthis is bullshit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what is bullshit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i've been in a AU for a total of about 5 minutes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: your supposed newly-found maturity which you have yet to grow into yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: except it basically stretches time for me out to a period of about 10 years</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dude its cool if you havent "grown" like you think you have</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: *should have</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It really isn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: listen the game has basically ended</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: by the time its over youll have grown up as much as you need to</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont try to force it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Well I know that now, obviously...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: this whole AU thing is mind boggling to me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dude.. honestly, itll be nice having somebody whos a little immature in the new world</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: if only you'd used the "shoosh, the big kids are talking," thing less...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well at that point i was just pissed in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: at everything and everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that was basically the whole motivation for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: nothing to be sorry for</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: AC, have I told you about the history of the kiddy-table memo? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no i made you feel inadequate</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and that was stupid of me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: SJ, no I have not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, whenever the memo is muted for whatever reason, the kiddy-table memo is opened, and it's actually kinda fun there. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: were all kids here</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yep. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: @ _@ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you game? :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nah jk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and just how many people are even in this mythical kiddy-table of which you speak :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it depends on the occasion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im... not sure if im ready for that yet tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *referring to the kiddy table ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: um... what, SL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well the girl i lost my virginity to is dead now so</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah imma hold off</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not interested in that sort of thing yet anyways. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: <span style="color:#a15000">"uMMM,,,"-ING, uH, iNTENSIFIES,,,</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...so heres an interesting philosophical question</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: okay, I think we should get back to the kiddy-table thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: would fucking cp count as bestiality?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: . . . ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like im legit curious</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not that im interested</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but like that just hit me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm... pretty sure it would...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "this is not sonic '06" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: SJ would you tell me about the kiddy-table again</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though i guess if you were in your human form it would be cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also I'm just gonna run to the other end of the incipisphere kthx --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so what's the point of this story</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((im sorry my character is a shit))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i feel the need to apologize ooc for this))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ((now you know how I feel))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((kinda awkward, but at least manageable.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((that said i cant say im not curious about the doggy dick thing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((everyone should include their genitals in their character design))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'm legit squicked out now... but apology accepted I think))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((yeah sorry))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also yeah, "this is not Sonic Next Gen" indeed))</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((so i can just go "5 inches" and be done with it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you've basically just told me that there's a place for all the kids...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: eh?</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and we make another memo to talk</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's just caled the kiddy table to discurage those that aren't willing to be humble enough to sit at the kiddy table if they have to. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, for the record, my headcanon is that regardless of his form, it /would/ be bestiality because his DNA is 50% lupine (which doesn't change when he switches forms), and the genetic level is what's important))</span><br />
