<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (more of "we collectively aren't deserving of the title" but yeah)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: Mmhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -In which Brad then killed SL, and we do not know his status since then.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: between the thing with Ash and Brad killing Ben.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: Like there was this lull and everyone went outside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Beans were spilled to Fluffly, we mention that we are more like superheroes than gods, Ash says she /was/ a god, Ben talked back, Ash shot near his foot, I tried to protect him, Ash bends my Soul Sword in half which causes extreme pain and "sith tier", Ben shot Ash with the parasite, and him and sith!me laughed while telling ash to get it out herself with space powers, then there was a fight I tried to preve</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but Brad teleported Ben to the other side of the planet and killed him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, Mike fixed my sword before the fight soooo</span><br />

<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: It's just, we have deities and he's sort of religious.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Its FL's main sword right now ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Brad. That is debatable. Shut up. You may have wanted him dead, but I /CERTIANLY/ do not want anyone here to be a killer or be killed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Does Ash know that?))</span><br />
