<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#830000">CURRENT naK [CNK]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi Nak âžœ</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nka</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that's twice today I've had to nickghost &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nickghosting is where your connection hiccups and disconnects client-side, but the server thinks you're still online, so when you try to get back on, it says your chumhandle is still in use. so you have to use a different one and wait for the first one to ping timeout.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (or if the handle registration hadn't expired, pester nickServ and do a ghost command)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically, one of the more annoying aspects of irc stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and in my case, it's because my desktop has to bridge connection through my laptop until I get a wifi adaptor (hopefully for gristmas :P), so when the desktop shuts down or I unplug the ethernet cable, the laptop ARBITRARILY reboots the wifi card))</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nickserv????</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nakserv</span><br />
