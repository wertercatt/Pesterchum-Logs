<span style="color:#339966">CDP: there's also apparently red titanite which i can use to set my sword on fire</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: but i havent seen any of that yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: you want to add some adamithrium to the mix dp?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: your sword can be indestructable to the 1.93x times\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it's so indestrustable it can breack normal adamathium\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: nah</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: wheres the fun in that</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *adamantium\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: also titanite could give it a run for its money im betting</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: i hit this thing with a hammer about 30 times while forging</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: the titanite didnt even buck</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: the steel certainly did, so i ran into some complications there</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it's adamantium mixed with mithril. i cvouldn't even really forge this thing i had to alchemize it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *couldn't\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: why cant you</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: just heat the steel part</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: and chuck the whatevermetalyouuse in there</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: it saves a lot of grist making it yourself</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: becuase I would need to keep adamantium in a liquid state and couldn't actuall sharpen the sword that way. once it cools it's indestructable\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: word of stan lee\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: liquid state...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: What is it with all these indestructible weapons? I thought the tried and true method was</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: make your stuff out of random relevant shit you had scattered around your house</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: this isnt indestructible</span><br />
<span style="color:#e1bf00">CEU: it never fails, unless it'd be hilarious</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: it wore down quite a bit earlier</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: to the point of being a blunt stick</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: earlier</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: it sharpens nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: and it takes impact</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: but the sharpened edge tends to dull quite quickly</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: not sure about CS' weird shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: TT, I have a Madokami poʃter I could ʃend you</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I mixed x-men comics and lord of the rings with metals to get adamantium and mithril. then sort of just alchemized them together\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: Hm..</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: you're welcome to leech titanite off me</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: its a grist type</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: alchemizing it into shards and forging a weapon yourself is cheaper than straight alchemizing</span><br />
