[05:57:36] <span style="color:#3b025a">CFS: probably so that he can recover from arm dislocation and spiral vomitting at a reasonable rate</span><br />
[05:58:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...snerk</span><br />
[05:58:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, which is why I understand how much of a threat he could possibly be.</span><br />
