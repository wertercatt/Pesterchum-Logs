[11:48:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I had this dream once where someone drank a potion and turned into a snake... then I woke up.</span><br />
[11:49:02] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: In order to switch like that and be able to instantly move, one would have to go through that change multiple times to get used to it. Even then, it cant be fun.</span><br />

[11:51:28] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Okay, that would be someone turning from a mamel, to a part-mamel-part-plant thing. Even if the skeletal structure was simmilar...</span><br />
[11:51:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you inprint on an existing creature, that creature still has the memory on how to move</span><br />
[11:52:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like Sprites</span><br />
[11:52:20] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, I suppose so...</span><br />
[12:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its simple to move if your sharing a body... but if its a brand new body with noone else in there... well its gonna be /tough/</span><br />
[12:03:15] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed...</span><br />
[12:10:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: saw that pic about wisdom Athena</span><br />
[12:10:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: intelegence is knowing /how/ to make antimatter</span><br />

[12:13:51] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... Please tell me you havent used antimatter for the heck of it.</span><br />

[12:15:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, the only time I remember you ACTUALLY using that stuff was in an attempt to close Chronos' black hole attack the other day on LoIaR...</span><br />
[12:16:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, at least I keep it contained.</span><br />
[12:16:30] <span style="color:#980002">CMH: it didn't work, did it? ♥</span><br />
[12:16:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, it didn't</span><br />

[12:18:13] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, yes, but....</span><br />
[12:19:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: explosions make everything cooler. how /much/ cooler, however, depends on what you exploded and whether or not it was a good idea to.</span><br />
[12:19:20] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Exactly. -And if one is a safe distance away from the explosion or not.</span><br />

[12:22:38] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: heh, nice.</span><br />
[12:23:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and on implosions and such... seeing underlings telefragged in the early game...</span><br />
