<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT gingerAnodynified [CGA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGA: Same here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Barely had time to make the Perfectly Generic Object.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let alone grab my grandpas urn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Yeah i panicked the whole 30 seconds</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I didnt expect the update to happen just then after the whole lost-player scare</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I entered the Land of Iron and Warmth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I'm in fire and diamonds</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GA?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGA: Aah, sorry.   Paths ad Quartz here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, you guys got Minerals, and I got a metal...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Hmm, i wonder what this'll mean about our aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: if we get any...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Quartz is used majorly in timepieces...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I know what aspect GA is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are the only ones that are in confusion about our titles...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: paths? Maybe a seer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It appears GA might be a seer of time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What did you manage to prototype?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I grabbed my grandpas urn and a perfectly generic object, like I planned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGA: In theory...   I think we're getting downtime before any further contact.   Hopefully the further contact might be more inclined towards class/aspect talk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: A miniture stuffed monkey and a rubik's cube</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Yeah, i'm thinking they are setting up the next set of puzzles and what not</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGA: I wasn't entirely certain what to aim for.   Someone said something living...   I've got a plant and a human-ish plush.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I think we're pretty good, hopefully nothing will go wrong </span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I honestly don't think anything could go wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: but you never know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Spires, you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I gotta wait for bookworm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He must have lost connection after entry... somehow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Yeah i'm all set, small purple monkey plush and a pooka shell</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: oooh, hope that won't set us back </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm gonna see about making some cards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good thing I have some cardstock in the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Hmm, don't overdo your inventory</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even have an array.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, thats cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its...</span><br />

<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: BB is online</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Invited him</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I appear to be group leader...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I guess we gotta remove the guys that are missing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since I couldn't contact Razcrimson.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Yeah i haven't heard from him at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I saw CT on earlier today but nothing else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry Spires, looks like your my client.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: No prob, just don't wreck my bathroom if we get to that stage</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think thats obvious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Until Bookworm gets back, I can't progress.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I'll see about getting Spires to the gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I thought everyone has to get in before me, since im last on the list</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, I love automatic scripts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: got us in a okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Fire and diamonds...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Light maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I feel pretty hopeful that we will be able to succeed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Sorry back, what'd i miss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: I'm gonna guess it'll be a while till our next update :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: hopefully the puzzle will include something in my area</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Though Im kinda worried about the affects of a perfectly generic object.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Shoo this is a memo for SBARG ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Hmm, can't be that bad, most many of us prototyped stuff like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3592cc">CDS: Hold on, sorry i gotta brb, can't respond for a little while</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: K.</span><br />
