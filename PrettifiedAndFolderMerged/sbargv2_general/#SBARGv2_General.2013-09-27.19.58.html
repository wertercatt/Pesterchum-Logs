<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sure ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok we all know trolls have nipples with are usually a apdatation to feed young. however trolls currently in cannon do not raise their young and have no need for nipples so why would they have them?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: vestigial? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0d1c9a">CURRENT despairingReader [CDR]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0d1c9a">CDR: i am starting to think that their four sided relations ships and nipples are left overs from when trolls speices were younger and less organized as a group  living in something like packs ((sorry had to switch for a moment))</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#c1bb10">CURRENT courageousScribe [CCS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: there would be mostly a group of four or five trolls in an inter dependate realation ship with each other. the kismises pair would be for fighting off rival trolls or large predators the mates sprites for breeding pairs and child rearing with the aspestuct and the moirails would be for keeping the group from infighting\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CGS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: since in this thoery this is before they discovered they could product offspring from the mother grubs or the mother grubs would be a protected member of the pack or group and needed to be protected to pass along the genes of that group.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: but it requires that there was at least a little bit of trolls raising trolls to account for the nipples. over time the troll became a more unifed people and stopped infighting meaning that less and less energy was needed to raise young and they could tame various fauna to raise the troll offspring for them demesating them if you will\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so troll nipples at this point i beveile are an rement of that time before demescation of the lueus. \l/</span><br />
