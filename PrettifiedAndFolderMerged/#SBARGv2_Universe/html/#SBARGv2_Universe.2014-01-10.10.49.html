[12:54:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Custom Wad.</span><br />
[12:55:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, thats what MD2 Models can look like.</span><br />
[12:55:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the 3D models feel kinda out-of-place though, with everything /else/ still being sprites... still, pretty cool.</span><br />
[12:56:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the 3D Models are custom addons, and everything else could be replaced the same way.</span><br />
[12:56:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I figured as much...</span><br />
[12:57:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So the Rings, Starposts, Monitors, and enemies could be replaced.</span><br />
[12:58:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, some things don't really look good if converted directly into 3D... like the monitors.</span><br />
[12:58:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since you should be able to see what you are popping from every angle.</span><br />
[01:01:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, Zero Angle objects should remain non models.</span><br />
[01:03:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, ones that couldn't be recognizable as the object if rotated.</span><br />
[01:05:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The main issue with 3D Models is the lack of being able to change the color of them.</span><br />
[01:09:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually... that sounds like a test I should attempt.</span><br />
[01:10:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SCIENCE TIME! :D</span><br />
[01:13:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see if I can do this with PCX files...</span><br />

[02:47:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Biggest Titan.</span><br />
[02:47:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 2. Why do you want to make a titan blanket when a pile is good enough?</span><br />
[02:48:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I am completely insane-</span><br />

[02:49:13] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm... Well, to be really really big, it needs both an inner and exo skeleton.</span><br />
[02:50:12] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and as far as I know, no creature has both.</span><br />
[02:50:34] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It also depends if the creature in question is a land or sea animal...</span><br />
[02:51:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Basically: No clue.</span><br />
[02:51:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically a creature that would need a blanket.</span><br />

[02:54:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ?</span><br />
[02:54:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you ever played SRB2?</span><br />
[02:54:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... SRB2?</span><br />
[02:54:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sonic Robo Blast 2. Its a Sonic fangame that runs on a heavily modified Doom Engine</span><br />
[02:55:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /heavily/ modified.</span><br />
[02:55:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh... sounds interesting.</span><br />
[02:55:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not like that ancient Sonic Doom 2 mod.</span><br />
[02:56:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Noted. But yeah, 'sounds interesting enough. I'll look at it later.</span><br />
[02:57:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even though one of the old developers was the dude that made Sonic Doom 2.</span><br />
[02:57:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EQ, if you want to play it multiplayer later, I still have the portforward set up for the server I was hosting...</span><br />
[02:58:51] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, I'll have to go get my computer that has better processing power than a watch and a pair of glasses, and I'd like to get used to the single-player firstly, for the controls. So, no need to worry CP.</span><br />
[02:58:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, if at all possible, play it on a different system than you have pesterchum running on. SRB2 /hates/ fullscreen-tabouts, and windowed mode is currently hardcode-locked to 200x120 resolution :/</span><br />
[02:59:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, until 2.1 comes out.</span><br />
[02:59:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We should actually wait for that before we all play.</span><br />
[02:59:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, we should /all/ play.</span><br />
[02:59:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that's true.</span><br />
[02:59:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I use the window key to get out of full-screen, it's still kinda weird flopping out of 256 color mode. âžœ</span><br />
[03:00:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we can do CTF and such</span><br />
[03:00:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((brb, gonna /attempt/ to get in the kitchen so I can finally have lunch...))</span><br />
[03:09:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((kback))</span><br />
[03:10:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Can we bake the worlds biggest donut?</span><br />
[03:10:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :O</span><br />
[03:11:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually at this point, "world's biggest" is subjective since I don't think anyone's made a donut on Starter yet...</span><br />
[03:11:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah âžœ</span><br />
[03:11:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty much any huge donut could apply for that. âžœ</span><br />
[03:11:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well lets make one for the ages.</span><br />
[03:12:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1 meter radius.</span><br />
[03:12:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that'd be a nice warm-up, probably.</span><br />
[03:12:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :o âžœ</span><br />
[03:13:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I was thinking more along the lines of like that one EEnE flashback episode where they made a pancake the size of the Cul-De-Sac...</span><br />
[03:13:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, perfect.</span><br />
[03:14:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would have to cook all the way through the donut, so it can't be fried, as it wouldn't go all the way through...</span><br />
[03:15:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right. freakin' square cube law...</span><br />
[03:15:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So we need to simaltaniously cook it on the inside and outside.</span><br />
[03:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, cook it evenly all the way through.</span><br />
[03:16:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in other words, we need to make a Cookalizer, but giant size.</span><br />
[03:16:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We need to build the world's largest microwave.</span><br />
[03:17:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe we could have a hot ring thing going through it round ways and heat that thing up to cook the inside while something else works on the outside? âžœ</span><br />
[03:17:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cookalizers actually cook /truly evenly/, unlike a "scalding dish frozen meal" microwave...</span><br />
[03:17:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[03:18:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So basically a giant cookalizer...</span><br />
[03:20:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we need to build a giant cookalizer to cook the giant donut?</span><br />
[03:21:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Part of me thinks there is an easier way...</span><br />
