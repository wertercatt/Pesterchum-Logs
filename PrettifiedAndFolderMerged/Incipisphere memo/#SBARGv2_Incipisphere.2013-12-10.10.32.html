<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, if thats the case, then it can burn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I agree with FL. if that's what's going on, Paradox Space can shove its metaphysical head up its ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but what could we even do to stop it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if paradox space decided to dick us all over... were at its mercy</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah FL, I'm here for you too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I was going to go the opposite of LE tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: According to Calliope, universes are supposed to eventually die.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: part of me is screaming "FL is high again", but the other part is screaming "let's at least try it, for Crux's sake".</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and I'm listening to the latter, this time.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and well, I would need to do more research about giving it immortality.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...the other thing I'm saying is, me, Ash, and anyone else with pets really oughta keep a close eye on them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For all we know, it might take an awakened god tier Page of Life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Kutone and Ruari still have their Lifey Thing option available, and the former has the same "prevent death as much as barking possible" badge set I do.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am sorry about suggesting the Chrono Trigger concept.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I guess game logic only goes so far, and real life stuff sometimes overrules it.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, it could be considered a punishment for FL's munchkinry. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and speaking of real-life biology laws, I'm mostly done writing that thing SL demanded of me... or rather, the thing I originally said I was going to write, not what he thought I said about it.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((*shrug*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Sburb's kind of a game you /have/ to munchkin to survive in, though.))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Which /would/ be my response in reality as well. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sigh. I kinda know what you mean. for a large chunk of the game I was playing CP as, as NV put it, "okami wish fulfillment thingy". and it took me until he said that to realize it. which is why I've been playing him a bit differently lately...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also tbh, if I was in a real session, I probably would at least climb the lower rungs of the Munchkin Tiers at some point.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( but not to the point of antimatter? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((hell no))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Personally, I like my reality based munchkinry. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that is Too Far by every definition... except if 682 got involved. I probably would be that desperate then.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Its much better than a portable hole sandwich. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I don't really consider CP to be a self-insert anymore, but aside from the lupine tendancies, he and I do still have basically the same personality.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( of course with all the RPing we have done here, I would likely start out my alchemy with getting a recipe modus... and doing code subtraction to get high tier shit. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( If we ever had a reallife session ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and I probably would beeline for the SAO Modus as well, it's just so cool :D))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Recipe and File System combo. SO COOL. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((id probably be too afraid and lazy to leave the house or do any climbing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I've heard people say that Homestuck is basically a let's-play-style strategy guide for Sburb, but I don't really see it being that way. RPing a session like this is probably way more helpful for something like that.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...guys, what happens if Chronos time warps from a period he was alive to now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Dr. Wily in Megaman II</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He might decide to go further back and become doomed so... wait, that would doom us too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: form personal time travel experience, I can say that going to the future isn't all that great most of the time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *from ➜</span><br />
