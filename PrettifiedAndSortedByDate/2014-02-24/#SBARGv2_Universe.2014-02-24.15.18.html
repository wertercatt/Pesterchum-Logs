[03:28:27] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: I mean, assside from being a large bit ssshorter than normal.</span><br />
[03:28:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he's the same as usual I guess. ➜</span><br />
[03:28:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno. he's been going to bed unusually early lately... also that.</span><br />
[03:30:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...plus he pestered me about ten minutes ago with this:</span><br />
[03:30:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#646464">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> began pestering creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CP]</span> at 13:18 -- -- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> changed their mood to RANCOROUS <img src='smilies/pc_rancorous.png' alt=':rancorous:' title=':rancorous:' />￼ -- -- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> ceased pestering creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CP]</span> at 13:18 --</span></span><br />
[03:30:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure if pesterhiccup or what</span><br />
[03:31:09] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: SSSo I take it he isss not in a good mood then?</span><br />
[03:32:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... actually, that seems to be what his client defaults to, so shrug.</span><br />
[03:35:12] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Hmm...</span><br />
[04:04:47] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...Any Idea where he isss? I have a bad feeling.</span><br />
[04:05:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: won't he like, yell at us for revealing his location or whatever? ➜</span><br />
[04:05:44] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Isss he sssafe?</span><br />
[04:06:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what even is the definition of "safe" with him?  ➜</span><br />
[04:06:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. he's hiding from Brad, but yes.</span><br />
[04:06:58] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Hold on, what?</span><br />
[04:08:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: for the past week or two, he's kinda had a... problem... with birds, including avian Animal Tiers.</span><br />
[04:08:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still not sure what it's about, but.</span><br />
[04:09:19] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: hmm?</span><br />
[04:09:51] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...would it happen to be any birdsss in ssspecific? Eaglesss, perhapsss?</span><br />
[04:10:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why are you asking? ➜</span><br />
[04:10:58] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Um, jussst a sssmall amount of hissstory that might be repeating itssself.</span><br />
[04:12:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I think it's crows that have been attacking him? that or ravens, not sure.</span><br />
[04:13:12] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: SSSo not eaglesss?</span><br />
[04:13:22] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Right, might jussst be a fluke then.</span><br />
[04:13:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess not. ...and I think the thing with Brad was he was afraid of being eaten by him while shrunk :P</span><br />
[04:14:10] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: SSShouldn't that be wearing off sssoon?</span><br />
[04:14:32] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually probably. ➜</span><br />
[04:14:43] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: And if that wasss the only reassson, he would be avoiding Asssh all the time.</span><br />
[04:16:34] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how would you know all this stuff? Why are you even so concerned about someone who's practically reached Kenny from south park tier? ➜</span><br />
[04:18:19] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Caussse he ownsss my houssse basssically.</span><br />
[04:21:53] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Weren't you concerned about your neighborsss and landlordsss and sssuch back at home?</span><br />
[04:21:59] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: On your earth?</span><br />
[04:22:44] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, that's one thing, but this is FL we're talking about. Honsetly, I've ran out of sympathy for him. ➜</span><br />
[04:23:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I haven't, but his shenans /are/ starting to get tiring...</span><br />
[04:23:58] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Oh, like Impsss with broken legsss?</span><br />
[04:32:27] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: (ssseriousssly, they jussst... ssscream. And do nothing except get on your nervesss.)</span><br />
[04:34:11] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: (they aren't even ussseful normally, except when in a ssswarm)</span><br />
[04:34:21] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: (Power in numbersss for thossse guysss I guessssss)</span><br />
[04:37:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (yeah, once you hit a certain power level, strength in numbers is the only threat even normal imps have)</span><br />
[04:37:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (........that and Ohgodwhat Mode.)</span><br />
[04:39:17] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: what mode?</span><br />
[04:39:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: freaky katamari mode pretty much. ➜</span><br />
[04:39:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ^</span><br />
[04:40:23] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...Like, mutant onesss that eat eachother to get bigger and grow more limbsss and eyesss?</span><br />
[04:40:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you could also call it Voltron mode... depends on just how the mob-spawn algo decided to break.</span><br />
[04:41:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not really, it's them being spawned /telefragged into each other/ and operating as one giant monster</span><br />
[04:41:15] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...ohgodwhat</span><br />
[04:41:24] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...and now I know why itsss called that.</span><br />
[04:41:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: exactly. ➜</span><br />
[04:41:58] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: I thought it wasss like, cloning failuresss.</span><br />
[04:43:19] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...Wait, did any of them ssspawn when sssomeone wasss blinking?</span><br />
[04:43:47] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: Actually, better quessstion.</span><br />
[04:43:55] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: How do you know if they are ssspawning or not?</span><br />
[04:46:45] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: I mean, they might jussst be sssneaking in everywhere.</span><br />
[04:56:26] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...What are you two doing?</span><br />
[04:59:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: messing around on tumblr and drawing things. will probably play danganronpa later, still got one chapter and two Class Trials to finish...</span><br />

[05:03:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wouldn't be surprising, considering so many others tend to keep me out of the loop for some probably obvious reason. ➜</span><br />
[05:04:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably because I ruin everything or something. ➜</span><br />
[05:04:38] <span style="color:#208060">CSN: FL, I need to warn you, Tollo isss on the loossse</span><br />

[05:06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry for being pissed at you Kimura, but... knowing the circumstances I'm in... yeah.</span><br />
[05:07:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well I don't /feel/ any motion right now.</span><br />
[05:07:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just tell me when you're no longer being chased by whatever. ➜</span><br />
[05:07:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: asshat ended up transforming into Kimura I guess to get close to me.</span><br />
