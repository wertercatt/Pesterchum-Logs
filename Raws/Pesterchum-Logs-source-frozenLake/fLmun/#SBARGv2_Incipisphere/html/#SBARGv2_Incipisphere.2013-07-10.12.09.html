<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's actually something I wanted to inquire to...Not sure if you know, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How he managed to get out of being Scratched and navigate his way back to this session. Why, too</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Same... /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He keeps saying he pulled the same stunt as Dave and Rose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Aka leaving.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: See.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's not the part that gets me, I figured at least that much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Again, its the getting into /this/ session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because the Furthest Ring isn't a casual tralala to and from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: he says he basically turned around...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Dave and Rose only made it to the new session by hitching a ride on a meteor that had a path charted to that session</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, maybe it twisted just the right way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, its possible to go into the furthest ring and get back to your session before you left.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe. Granted trial and error, or guidance from the HTs, and/or a lotta luck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And plus, Dave and Rose spent a large ammount of time leaving the green sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If it was as simple as putting one foot out, stepping out, waiting for it to pass, then stepping back in everyone might've done the same.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, one would need a head start...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're not understanding me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's not a matter of getting /away/ its a matter of getting /back/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, when one is god tier, they don't exactly have cells die from old age.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The space you /think/ you just stepped out of is actually blank space. The sessino you thought was there ain't anymore, because spacetime's in a double mobius reacharound of fucking itself over</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fact is, we don't know HOW LONG he spent out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: could have been a few minutes, could have been a hundred years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Even so. Without a map or guidance he'd almost certainly just get lost forever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He was a derse dreamer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Odd, how the scratch changed that between us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But the matter of the fact is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He likely did have directions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I dunno how much further I can stress the "spacetime /laughs/ at your attempts to navigate it". I just...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CIS: 'e was a blood player</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The horror terrors likely know the way around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CIS: so its not like 'e 'ad an instict</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not saying he had instinct.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm saying he had horror terrors to point him in the right direction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not like the furthest ring is devoid of those, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Why would they help him, though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It doesn't make sense...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the better question is... why not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because they have better things to do then help jackasses turning tail and fleeing to prolong their existence?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Arguing about this won't change that it happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe not. But figuring out the why could be the key to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't know what, exactly. But something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thing is, ever since I saw him at the base last time, I haven't seen him since.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But lets change topics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How is the searching for the genetic code going?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Apparentlyy its stalled /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ no one reallyy knows what to submit /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CIS: i submitted</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa0000">CDS: As Did I</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Try submitting the existing pages.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I should get on that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyway, gonna take a nap in the jamming field.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CDS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: later.</span><br />
