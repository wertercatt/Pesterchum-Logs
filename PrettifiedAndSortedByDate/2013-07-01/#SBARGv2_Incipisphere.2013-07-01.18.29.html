<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FUCK</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm just lucky that the game only took an art style prompt from the Plush Ammy Toy proto, instead of giving underlings power over the Brush.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: and τhaτ τhe underlings also only τook τhe liking of normal Maria Ushiromiya</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its variable strength, based on the ammount of players joining in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT:  <a href='http://umineko.wikia.com/wiki/Maria_Ushiromiya'>http://umineko.wikia.com/wiki/Maria_Ushiromiya</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The more players, the stronger it is.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hold on, lemme take a look at... oh dear frogs. even with all the Prospit mail sidequests, I can't afford that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I don'τ know why Elsey τook τhe form of Wiτch of Θrigins!Maria</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: The Solution is simple- We Hit the black king, or you-know-who with a planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: We don't? I thought we were all buddies!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we try to work together, but the sheer ammount of chaos in this session...</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: I hope we can come together for one hit, at least!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Judging from the supposed power, which seems to increase exponentially...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: And we should all pool our grist the big one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PO, its not grist we need. </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But boondollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *boonbonds</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: There's probably a device that can convert them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Oh, then boonbonds!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, its much more than a boonmint even.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Can't we just put it all in a huge bank?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seriously? motherbark...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently the SAO Modus screen can't show a boonmint's worth of zeroes, it cuts off after boonbond level.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: SAO? Sword art online?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: From the ammount of Zeros, I assume that It will cost 1 Decillion Boondollars.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...well, barf. this is one time where xchat's "put everything from one channel in the same logfile" is better than pesterchum's "divide a memo's logs timeways". I can't remember when I posted the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: noτ sure if I should geτ a beττer sylladex modus..</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: functionally, it's Array with a sweet gui and a few plugins, like a remote wardrobifier and backup message system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: I did the thingy and combined it with Tornado</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: oh? what'd you get?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, no sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Miscalculated, forgot after a point it increases in increments of a thousand instead of a million.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: What is it now?</span><br />

<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: gah...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so quntillion * million?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: FUUUUUUUUU-wait, that's lower decillion, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, why can't I do math today.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait no thats right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A boon mint is one Septillion boondollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need a billion of those, so yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FL, give us the math formula.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Boondollar is a value of 1, Boonbuck is 1,000,000...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its 10^33 boondollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: WE HAVE TO COLLECT AS MUCH SW337 L007 AS POSSIBLE!</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: basically yeah</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EVERYONE GO TO THE DREAM MOONS AND GRIND MAIL QUESTS LIKE TOMORROW NEVER HAPPENED!</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: LET'S DO ALL THE DUNGEONS.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: OF.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: THEM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least it isn't a googol.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would be fucked then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: THANK GOD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wasn't there a point in time when we pretty much had a zilion boondollars?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: or a googolplex</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the Final Lore Dungeon on LOSACrystal is supposed to be full of SW33T L00T... BUT I'M STILL FOUR LEVELS BELOW THE ENTRY REQUIREMENT FROGDAMMIT</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: or however τhaτ's spelled</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TT, if it was a googolplex, we would never reach it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (however, once I meet the (level &gt;= 550) req, I can bring anyone no matter what /their/ level)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even if we turned every parficle in our old universe into a boondollar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: I just maxed out, but I can't find ANY of my dungeons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Whelp. time to tap into doomed universes, then. they don't need the boonbucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Good luck with that, FF.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF, it isn't that price</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't worry</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ....?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a googolplex in price.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Still, It's a good idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it was, we wouldn't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And wouldn't the physical objects be doomed too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Not if we steal them!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: We can make out like bandits!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF stop being an idiot about timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: boonmoney is not so much physical objects as points. like grist doesn't actually exist on the physical plane even though it appears to</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If timeclones are doomed, what about boondollar timeclones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's not time travel! it's just accessing alternate dimensions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Who here is a Time/Space hero?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: *just*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you don't mess with paradox space. it will slap you down faster than you can say "oops i brok it"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm a heart hero, so I guess I shouldn't be talking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm a time player</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I guess I can tell that its a stupid idea still?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I'm also a heart player. really wish we had a rage palyer. could break the limits of things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I work with the "essence" of stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heart, Soul, Essence.</span><br />
