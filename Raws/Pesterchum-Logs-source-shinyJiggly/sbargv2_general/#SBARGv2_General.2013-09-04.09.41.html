<span style="color:#000000">CSG: According to a source, he visited the Incipisphere memo and mentioned plots being retconned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Huh.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2mqqCMu-LM'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2mqqCMu-LM</a> I am not sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He did mention something in the general chat :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: About starting up a new arg :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and being mad at the admins or something :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ....wat /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tired of admin infighting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont even know  who the admins are so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ^ I could see that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont think i have anything to contribute to this</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, I guess there's admin infighting? I don't know. He just passively mentioned it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Well, I would like to say that there has been no admin infighting. The only issues between admins has been caused by the presence of SV and his conflicting opinions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh boy politics</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm... I'm not sure if /I/ should pastebin something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, thanks for posting that lol :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Huh, SG. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't really know what to make of it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As it might be best kept private.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: We are also not retconning any existing plotlines, just changing them. SV was not a fan of the changes despite being overruled.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then don't, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its kinda about this though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, do what you gotta do. Maybe pm SG if it's private? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If it's best kept private or was told to you in confidence...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no idea what to do</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: can you at least say who's involved in it? maybe send it to who needs to see it over pm? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *shrugs* If it betrays trust, how much d'you value someone's trust, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: He has been impulsive with his decisions which has caused problems for the other GMs in the group, thus SV is no longer a GM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: SG, not taking sides here, not even sure what's going on, but isn't a retcon technically a change to an existing canon? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah i was thinking the same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: A retcon is pretending it didn't happen entirely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean i dont care about retconning but</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I have known him to be impulsive. Still like the guy. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SG, do the plotlines you're not retconning involve things SV has simply done on his own without running them past a majority of the GMs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh well then</span><br />
Retroactive continuity (often shortened to retcon) refers to the deliberate alteration of previously established facts in a work of serial fiction.<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont have any problem so</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Huh, 'k.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: We are still able to edit the plots without retconning them completely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i havent been involved in the major arcs anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just wondering something else real quick. Did SV break a rule as well by revealing to the general that he was a gm? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: No. That was his choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I suppose it would be a personal choice. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: The rest of the GMs have all decided to remain anonymous for the fun of the ARG.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does this have anything to do with that one memo-log post that I was told to get rid of for some weird reason? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... the only recent SV-run "canon" event I can think of was two days ago on the meteor... which I can't remember what it was about since I joined late</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FS' plotline involving a trans-sessional void-connection uplink. Thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which he was incredibly excited about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: off-topic: <a href='http://asstlevania.tumblr.com/post/60296641011/greatesteverseamonkey-so-im-on-a-seedy-website'>http://asstlevania.tumblr.com/post/60296641011/greatesteverseamonkey-so-im-on-a-seedy-website</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I just rejoined yesterday. Oh. Speaking of which, is dubiousSwain in the incip chat? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah im not involved enough in admin politics to have any meaningful input</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Darn :'/ :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: amy is though</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: SV took that out of context and I am sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: When I said I didn't want the ARG to be all about the people on the memo, the context was that I wanted memo players and tumblr players to all be able to play together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda wish that more people could be involved again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I agree on that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Same, FL :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's funny, because my character is all individualistic :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think teamwork will be key :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: More like. Player-things, instead of just nothing and us getting bored with like nothing to do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Collaboration was the greatest part of the orignal SBARG.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That'd be cool from an RP standpoint.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and I would hate for that spirit to vanish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Yes, and we're trying our hardest to think up ways to reignite that feeling of comradere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why I came up with the concept of Sburban Finale</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the other day SP thought it was "supposed to be about team spectrum", and I just felt horrible because not only is someone mising 99% of everything else, but they also think that a broken team is important. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I thought about that a couple months ago. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: No one team is important.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: No one player is important than the other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But it also doesn't seem like it's really about /anyone/ except /Chronos/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except seth</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, I'm not even sure if TT is even going to ever show up in the memo. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He's off lurking in the background and we're like. "whee we are twiddling our thumbs".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but hes the main villain, so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: while we wait for our boring villain to show up and do shit that he's not doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well, SG, I'd say it's more like every team is important and every player is important. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: Indeed, he is the main villian.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and with NN gone, this place is so quiet ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: I am not as eloquent with my words.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: im just staring because i didnt know half of this stuff was a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: im just developing my land quest atm</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So spectrum shouldn't necessarily be thought of that elite team, though it's okay for them to think of themselves as such (not saying that as an insult) but truely, they are not more important or elite than other teams or players :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CSG: That would be correct, EP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: which is not to say they're not important :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Lone Wolf VS The companionship of friends.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: In fact, they are. And the other teams are as well. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats what I see SBARGv2 as being about</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: haha and it's funny, because my character is like the lone wolf, but I'm all stressing and emphasizing companionship out of character :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm still asking honestly what are we /doing/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and what I saw that the Orignal SBARG was about as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: my companionship is mostly other characters i control so what does that tell you about me as a mun</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't necessarily know what we're doing. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The Players are running outta idears for dungeons and whatnot and our GMs are just like doing their own things with their own chars and we're staring at 'em going "so what do we do now".</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I can see that perspective. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there is the LoSaC Pit of 100 Trials...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog, that'll take all month ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: pit of 100 trials?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fuck yes i want in now</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … didn't you say you wanted to trap me in a wall and fill up a room with slowly burning acid?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is /that/ your pit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: see this is the first rp i ever really got into</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: okay :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but then i realized that a good character needed more than that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So he grew</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hence all the development sls gotten over the past week or so</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: My character was hugely obnoxious. And while he may or may not still be, at least I don't totally hate my own character. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i created an ai character that didnt have a lot  of thought put in, but when discussing it i think i created a much more nuanced ai character</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: im surprised an ai going rogue and then realizing it was wrong to do so isnt a more common trope tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: to be honest, I think I actually thought of CP's self-prototyping several weeks before it happened, the Battery Incident just gave me a perfect IC reason for it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i know, ive sort of had a lot  of this brewing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you were ignoring me you wouldn't state you are ignoring me as a responce.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and im afraid there might still be some ooc resentment for my characters actions earlier on</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as that therefore means they you are /not/ ignoring me to say you are ignoring me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that*</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Maybe AG has a quirk so that every time you talk, AG says: FL I am ignoring you :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because, well, look at it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: any memo I am in and gambit is in, it will automatically spam that message if I say /anything/</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: surely AG wouldn't spam :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it would be worse if we change Gambits name to my own</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As it would be replying to herself then</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so I don't think gambit will actually create that script :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: do what now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: this discussion was going so well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THAT IS GENIUS</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh wait, scripts gone bad is what happened to naziofGrammar the other day isn't it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: hehe :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and possibly break the channel</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: that kid sure liked his new world orders :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So what's another good idea for sbargv2 improvements? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Rain ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: hehe :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ It sh6uld rain every Qnce in a while ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm sure it has rained on somebody's land :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: before :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ It's raining here ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL has several Focus ribbons, that burn away after one use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: What is it raining?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: wouldn't it be funny if someone had fire powers and they were having a fight against someone or something and all of a sudden it started raining? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ HydrOgen, Oxygen, sOme nitr6gen ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Idk what else ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If FL would get killed by an attack that would bring him from 2 or more HP to zero, it will save him at 1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However he has a few of these... and a regen item.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i feel like we need more session-wide villains imo</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the most teamworky ive been was when fi was involved</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://pastebin.com/wFfni8zT'>http://pastebin.com/wFfni8zT</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats the code for the regen item</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: assuming you start from 1 hp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I kind of like that idea too, SL :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it waits a number of frames, then adds 1 to his current HP unless he reaches his cap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: FM, do you like dogestep? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of 2047.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: As do I, SL/EP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Idk what that is ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP:  <a href='http://25.media.tumblr.com/c3116ce6797f5196c39bd442fcd62e70/tumblr_msk2kscRBO1qi91wgo1_500.jpg'>http://25.media.tumblr.com/c3116ce6797f5196c39bd442fcd62e70/tumblr_msk2kscRBO1qi91wgo1_500.jpg</a> :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah FL, that's not OP at all. that's just common gaming sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so much dogestep :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: now if it restored you to /full/ HP every time, that'd be OP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: is SJ still doing the glitch cave thing? having some glitch creature spawn and try to destroy the session could be cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But see, as long as he has focus ribbons, he could survive point blank /antimatter explosions/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ....Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh....</span><br />
<span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ HellO ♫</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so it sounds like he figured out how to break the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I know everyone and their mom's taken the game logic to the umpth degree but</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is it /really/ that prevalent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: technically it wasn't completely a glitch cave, more of an LSD dream emulator esque cave. and she already got past that area. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CP's Emergency Point Swap would probably be on the same power tier or close to it; it refills HP by however much FP the wearer has at the time, but does NOT regen on its own so Happy Flower badges take care of that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL, EP, what sort of "session-wide villains" would there even be?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah</span><br />
