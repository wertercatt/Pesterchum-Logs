<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hey. so she'll be under for a couple hours. her ears are a little more than fubar'd so i'm giving her some minor cybernetics to compensate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: how<span style="color:#730e8f"> so</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: should there have been more time, i would have done something else. but considering the crunch this works best.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: short term, she hears well and we need her too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: long term, if we live long enough to go through the door it won't matter.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're welcome to wait here for the next five hours or so, or fuck off to some distant land far far away, while she undergoes the surgery.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: than<span style="color:#730e8f">k you</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you got it. you'll have restricted access to the crew quarters. she's on the same level. the girls washroom is completely out of commission and should be left alone. feel free to use any of the rooms. be aware of the other crew mate in the officer's quarters adjacent to the medical bay that FA is in./</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...I don't know...Maybe I'll stick around here since my Land's pretty much empty at this point...</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so what about you CP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, question still stands. FL specifically warned me while I was rebuilding his spire to not even move the cursor near his bathroom...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: might head back to LoFaT, make sure Crux and Kutone didn't get into the frog lab...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah, that'd be a thing to take care of...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well if you wanna stick around, go take the elevator to the crew quarters. if you aren't then feel free to just portal out.</span><br />
