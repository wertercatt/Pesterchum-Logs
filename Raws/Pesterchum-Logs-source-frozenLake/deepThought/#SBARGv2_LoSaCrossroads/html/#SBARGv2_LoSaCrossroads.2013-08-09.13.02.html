[01:48:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: By that logic his only friends would be himself, Kimura, and Ash.</span><br />
[01:49:04] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm, indeed.</span><br />
[01:49:34] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Yes.</span><br />
[01:50:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wow, okay, ouch</span><br />
[01:50:11] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Those are who I expect would follow him into what might be a death trap.</span><br />
[01:50:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...That's the weirdest backhand compliment I've ever heard...I think?</span><br />
[01:50:41] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Yeah...</span><br />
[01:52:42] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: However, I suppose I forgot to calculate for how stubborn you guys are, and for the AI who would assist with the diplomacy.</span><br />
[01:53:03] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: 'Thank you.</span><br />
[01:53:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So getting to the point, what do you want?</span><br />
[01:54:35] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: ...Once FL is fixed I will be shutting down.</span><br />
[01:54:51] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: I deleted revelation as soon as I got inside of the field.</span><br />
[01:54:59] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: You don't need to worry about that anymore.</span><br />
[01:55:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I never was worrying about it, I don't buy into us being code.</span><br />
[01:55:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now then, how do we fix Charles? Might as well give you a hand.</span><br />
[01:55:35] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: mhm...</span><br />
[01:56:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually NV, this game is so many layers of meta I wouldn't doubt us being code. but yeah, what do we do now?</span><br />
[01:57:20] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: No, I guess Kimura could help, but there is too much damage you could do inside of him.</span><br />
[01:58:18] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: So... we wait and see. Is that it?</span><br />
[01:58:54] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Exactly.</span><br />
[01:59:26] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Plus... I fear I might have pissed off Dolos.</span><br />

[02:01:07] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Oh joy... And you might have pissed it off? Even better.</span><br />
[02:01:28] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: Well, I did intrude on its territory.</span><br />

[02:02:21] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: bluh</span><br />
[02:03:28] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: So. We sit, wait, and fend off enemies if they come too close. 'that the plan?</span><br />
[02:04:00] <span style="color:#20b0e0">CDT: ...Yeah.</span><br />
[02:04:01] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...So wait a second here.</span><br />
