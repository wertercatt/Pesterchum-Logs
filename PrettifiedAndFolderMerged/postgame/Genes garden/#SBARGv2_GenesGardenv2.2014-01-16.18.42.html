<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  curiously looks at her. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not much really. And in a way, I'm okay with that.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: cool. cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  rubs hand through hair. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, sometimes it feels like I'm smack dab in the middle of a dating game that I never signed up for. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I guess its kind of annoying huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.Sorry about crushing your dreams or anything like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: N-No. No its all cool. I mean. I wasn't, really... uh...</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: With beachball.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Teasing him a bit too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I mean If i gave YOU the wrong Idea then Im sorry for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I mean, youre wonderful and all</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: im just</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: gonna stop talking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  shuts up. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT compactPowerhouse <span style="color:#9f8a89">[CCP]</span>  small sleepy hiccup --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  yawns a little and sorta glances at her notepad --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  glances at CP and SJ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wonder... what qualities I'll be remembered for... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I guess thats something to think about...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  feels almost a little guilty because an answer came naturally to her. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I guess thats another reason to get to know people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: looks like I have another set of loops to work on my house tomorrow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: only got most of the work covered "today", still have some more stuff to do to put it together. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's kinda weird working on a project doing a bunch of scheuled tasks with yourself from slightly different timeframes and steadily working your way through the different roles as you get through the loops. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, you get to a point where you know exactly what's going to happen and you get really good at the routine. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I totally got the inspiration to do a manuver like that from that one scene in the 4th pokemon movie. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I havent seen it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's the one with Celebi in it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I've... not really seen any of the movies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I have seen that one but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I forget.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I was heckling the entire movie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Ah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Honestly I just didn't like the animated movies and stuff. It was way too corny and childish to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Didn't really grow up on pokemon either</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can understand that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: On recently I began to pick it up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: only*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think the later pokemon movies were kinda meh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but maybe that's just nostalgia talking. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  shrugs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I did enjoy the Pokemon X and Y games though. For a first game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, that is a pretty good one. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  nods. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm surprised at how well they were able to spice it up, considering how 5th gen was kinda shrug. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I completely skipped 5th Gen in terms of paying attention.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Most of the design choices made me bleh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... I can agree on you with that one. I swear half of them were made just to become action figures. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: yeeeaahh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Thankfully G6 was a bucket of keepers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Stuff I actually wanted.</span><br />
