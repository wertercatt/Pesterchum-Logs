[05:12:30] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im not surprised</span><br />
[05:12:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets just say I was pretty much asking for it.</span><br />
[05:12:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Who else do you know who would just drop a washing machine on someone?</span><br />
[05:12:45] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well yeah</span><br />
[05:12:57] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: talk shit get hit</span><br />
[05:13:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((huh, interesting...))</span><br />
[05:14:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so FL, I reread the log I missed because of the episode... why the hell were you thinking the lands were gonna deorbit?</span><br />
[05:14:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i mean a beta enemy is no big shock, but why would there be a single one placed under the floor, only in mission 8?))</span><br />
[05:14:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I see what you did there))</span><br />
[05:14:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I was watching that Majora's Mask game theory.</span><br />
[05:14:49] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i dont))</span><br />
[05:14:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((no big shock))</span><br />
[05:15:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And well, thinking about the effects of earth being thrown of orbit, yeah.</span><br />
[05:15:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: jesus fucking christ fl stop watching shitty gaming videos</span><br />
[05:15:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((<img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' />))</span><br />
[05:15:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((:b))</span><br />
[05:15:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured that maybe meteors passing by could have an effect on the orbit of the lands, but I stupidly used normal physics.</span><br />
[05:15:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have no clue what is going to happen.</span><br />
[05:15:44] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((also cp theres this disturbing unused pollution map: <a href='http://tcrf.net/images/a/a4/SMSpollution.png'>http://tcrf.net/images/a/a4/SMSpollution.png</a> ))</span><br />
[05:16:00] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((it would have been layered over a level to show where the pollution is))</span><br />
[05:16:56] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((pfft))</span><br />
[05:17:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... I'm not sure the incipisphere even COULD run on normal orbital physics, really. like with the 27 planets in the Medusa Cascade, they /can't/ orbit that close without assistance (or just not using regular physics to begin with)</span><br />
[05:17:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((the entirely underwater portion of noki bay has a used pollution map, but its washed away immediately by the ocean: <a href='http://tcrf.net/images/e/ea/SMSmaresea.png'>http://tcrf.net/images/e/ea/SMSmaresea.png</a> ))</span><br />
[05:17:51] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i assume you can read those kana))</span><br />
[05:17:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((XD))</span><br />
[05:18:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((snrk))</span><br />
[05:18:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...right then. ))</span><br />
[05:18:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I'll just be in stupidity. ))</span><br />
[05:18:16] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((it says "baka" for those who dont know))</span><br />
[05:18:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ... ))</span><br />
[05:18:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((which means idiot))</span><br />
[05:18:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...not sure if your serious or not. ))</span><br />
[05:18:44] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((fitting, since it gets washed away instantly))</span><br />
[05:18:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I know what Baka means. ))</span><br />
[05:18:51] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((no im completely serious))</span><br />
[05:19:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((it looks like this pollution map was made in mspaint ))</span><br />
[05:19:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((it probably was))</span><br />
[05:19:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, SL!</span><br />

[05:19:46] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((every level has a pollution map, im guessing a developer just whipped that one up in 5 minutes knowing it would never actually be used))</span><br />
[05:20:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been making fake pokemon!</span><br />
[05:20:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: make a poison/fairy based on the nuckelavee</span><br />
