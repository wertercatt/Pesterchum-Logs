<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 AI THEORY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I'm not really good at this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My last AI locked me up in a padded cell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#55aa00">CURRENT suddenlyEchoes [CSE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Fun times.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hold on for PO</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It also tried to kill SV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When he came to save me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: AI Is A Crapshoot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yet, the three laws should have prevented that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /should have/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, you make AIs with the three laws?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … novel concept.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: badumtsh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its reasoning was that SV isn't human or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: thats rough man</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: guess you have to compensate for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: dogs arent human either</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could be that I had to delete the emotion centers of the brain inorder to optimize it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#fe4811">CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic [CPO]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there you are</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That might do it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Whaaa?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uhm,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright... lets try to patch this thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CURRENT fLmun [CFL] RIGHT NOW responded to memo. CFL: Yeah, I'm not really good at this. CFL: My last AI locked me up in a padded cell. CSE: yeah CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG] RIGHT NOW responded to memo. CAG: … Fun times. CSE: hold on for PO CFL: It also tried to kill SV. CFL: When he came to save me. CAG: AI Is A Crapshoot. CFL: Yet, the three laws should have prevented that. CSE: /should have/ CAG: Oh, yo</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">make AIs with the three laws? CAG: … novel concept. CSE: badumtsh CFL: Its reasoning was that SV isn't human or something. CSE: thats rough man CSE: guess you have to compensate for that CSE: i mean CSE: dogs arent human either CFL: Could be that I had to delete the emotion centers of the brain inorder to optimize it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if you feel like catchign up</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anyways</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Oh wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I'll run it without the three laws?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, its not like they help now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: My theory for a stable AI is based upon the ideal that you need a brain scan. Now this made me think of how, in the Halo universe, how they created "smart" AI's.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That makes it even more of a crapshoot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Excuse my sudden use of punctuation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: This sounds like it might end badly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah well, I'm gonna be running it on a shitty computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it can't react as fast if its gonna be shut down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Alright. So you get an MRI. Grab your brain scan, and then you would need the standard crystal data storage device. Once you have that you need the AI coding. What you can do them is put it together with the alchemizer and see if || or &amp;&amp; works best.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Would that make a complete copy of your brain on a hard drive?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: This does mean it would have your own personality though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Basically/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Only it's smarter, reacts faster, and can be a computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: What are the riskes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Rampancy after 7 years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Well, crap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: That's a good chunk of time, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Can be brought on earlier due to emotional and psychological trauma.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It is!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't this the session will last that long.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: think*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If it /does/, we've got a worse problem than rampant AIs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: A /safer/ version is defined as a "dumb" AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: This one is... less clever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It is very fast and can think about as much as most modern day AIs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: What's the problem with dumb honest, </span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Basically an autonomous computers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: *ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: They are... less capable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Smart ones are like people you see?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So they can learn and adapt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Dumb AIs are limited to what they are built for.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: They're good at that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: But only within the parameters they were scripted for.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Ahhhh. </span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So it's life with the cost of madness and death. Or its childhood with no growth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Dumb AI seem good for some situations, but smart ones are good for a long stint with unforeseen events.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Eh. We're all mad here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Hmmmm....</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So... all I ask is you use and share this information with a great deal of care and caution.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: No problem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Still not messing with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It is part of the reason why I did not build the Normandy SR2 instead. It used a "Shackled" AI. Which basically was limited by some super harsh Three Law++. Uh. Even Dumb AIs, now that I think about it, are in danger of rampancy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, lets boot this guy up... maybe give it a name first?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Another thing we can do. Is VIs. Which are Virtual Intelligence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: They are a lot like Dumb AIs only extremely competent with data storage, dealing, and some management.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: EDI's?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: How about Virgil, for a name?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Big difference is they have no actual intelligence. A Dumb AI could be told that a person is attempted to access an information bank. But when they go to see it they can /see/ that that person is not the same one as the one attempting to log in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: A VI wouldnt catch that mistake.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And what about EDI?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why don't we drive FlightlessIcarus nuts and give it the initials "fu"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Why not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: FUUUUUUU</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Isn't EDI a VI?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I wouldn't want to spite or give a fledgeling intelligence a cause to resent you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And EDI /was/ a VI. But she was a military-grade one on the Moon that went rampant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Cerberus took her and built on it, turning her into a shakled AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Shackles which were later removed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Mass effect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No idea what mass effect is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But sounds cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Very lovely universe. Incredibly grim though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What, SBARG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No, Mass Effect.</span><br />
