<span style="color:#750058">CSB: im hearing</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So there I was, crafting all sorts of things out of silk. A parachute, a web cartridge, I even combined my boomerang and silk together. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- FUTURE shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[FSJ]</span>  stands there, still wearing some weird kinda robe, listening intently, the zap-tap badge is pinned on her hat-top --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I even crafted a little penguin plush toy, since as you know, I like penguins. And what better way to make a plush than out of silk? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT existentialPenguin <span style="color:#133295">[CEP]</span>  flips to the next note card --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ...excuse me, I have to write down my thoughts. otherwise they become a whole blob of mess. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#750058">CSB: you can /)o a penguinsprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So there I was, with my penguin plush toy, when all of a sudden, after encountering no monsters, a couple of ogres appeared. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#750058">CSB: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sharkBelligerant <span style="color:#750058">[CSB]</span>  sits on floor --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I thought I could just fight them off, but my, were they powerful. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sharkBelligerant <span style="color:#750058">[CSB]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Sooo...I got beaten up pretty bad. But at the last moment, they noticed my plush toy, took it, and walked away. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: My life spared, and my plush toy..taken. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But, hey. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It gave me an idea. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I could be a merchant to these monsters. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- FUTURE shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[FSJ]</span>  continues listening, smiling --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And it seemed to work, too. ((even though it probably shouldn't)) :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: These monsters came up in lines, imps, ogres, liches, the whole bit. I couldn't really tell what they wanted, since I don't speak whatever language they speak, but I made as many different plushes as I could. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And in return, they gave me their grist. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And walked away, with me unscathed. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But as anyone would know, there is supply and demand. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#750058">CSB: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's tough to keep up with all the demand. And with all the word of mouth spreading, I had to keep up if I wanted to live. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">FSJ: man, you must be an awesome businessman. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So I used the grist to build together some machinery to make some plush toys :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: like an assembly line :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#750058">CSB: ((brb))</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And thus, the monsters, while alive, do not bother me.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But, that is not the shop I am about to run. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ((okay, SB))</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and not the shop that I'm about to cater to the players for. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ...Also, not the shop that I am having this grand opening for. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: See, with all the building of the grist, I've been able to go through the gates. As well, I now know what my classpect is.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And as such, I have learned a great deal of things, while working in the shadows. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So, to you guys, I welcome you to EP's secret shop :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And what do I sell? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Secrets! :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Information :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Think of it as wikileaks, for a price :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have gossip, classified information, things that shouldn't be known, and anything else that would otherwise be secret. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have quite the knowledge. But I write it down. Because my brain can hardly keep track of it all.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And if I do not know a secret, I can easily find out. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- FUTURE shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[FSJ]</span>  stands there, waiting --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Do not worry. I do not require a purchase. My shop is open at any time one requests something that was previously unknown to be known. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just tell me what you would like to know, we can negotiate a price, and I'll have the information asap. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Now, now. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Some would say my practices aren't quite legal :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but rest assured :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: they aren't :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but hey, while you may not think you would like my services at the moment, I would estimate that all of you, at some point in time, will be requesting of something. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I'll be there when that happens. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: This is my calling card :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The great thing is, you guys don't have to come here to strike up a deal. Though I would like one to come in person if they are to give me something in return for my service. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But please, tell all your friends. :&gt;</span><br />
