<span style="color:#ff80e1">CMG: Not really</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff80e1">CMG: Text is the only thing I can do atm</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: LOL :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I guess it's because most omeglers are pervs. Oddly enough, I never do that. :&gt;</span><br />

Paragraph style please c; )) Sollux paused his hunting, and perked up from the portion of forest that he called his hunting grounds. He smelled unmistakable scent of meat. He pondered if it was a human, an animal, or even a troll of some sort.  He ruled out the animal portion, and &lt;/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">curiously, yet cautiously, slithered up a branch and coiled himself up to disguise him. The 14 foot Naga smirked as he looked down at the other, and thought of ambushing them, but thought better of it. He wasn't super hungry, and could just eat sone nearby berries to calm down his appetite to be civil with the other. He uncoiled himself and slithered down quietly behind the other, forcing a friendly smile. Sollux </span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">wasn't all that civil, but would try and make conversation. It kinda got lonesome around here. Everyone always ran away. Those who didn't, died. "..Are you lotht?" He asked with a slight uncontrollable lisp that made him mentally slap himself. Other then the forced smile, he showed no emotion at all. So it was untellable if he'd attack or not. That decision he'd make later." ~~~~</span><br />
