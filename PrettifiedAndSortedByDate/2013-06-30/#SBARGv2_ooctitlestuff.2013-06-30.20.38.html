<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Honestly bugs me for what it does</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#fe4811">CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic [CPO]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: I have arrived!</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SE is a Blood player. Don't know what class though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CPC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: He was a Knight of Blood in SBARG and SCODE again. So it would not be beyond me to assume it once more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Never assume</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: For assumption is, without understanding and knowledge of what you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: He wasn't anything, before! This is his first session!</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: A train that leads off your tracks</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: RS was Mind in the first Sbarg and Scode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Nope, PO</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#29486d">CURRENT avoidantCorrespondent [CAC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: i was a knight of rage in v1</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This time he's Heart because of a shift in stance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: mage of light in v1, ??? of time in v2</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Weird change.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Going from modelling himself on the external, and his desire to follow in Dae's footsteps, to accepting himself for who he is</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Daedalus, that is</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Personally, Even things you don't know</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Can be your title</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Learning is a game in which understanding is what you need</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Daedalus being his Denizen in the original and Scode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: PO's just an altruist, trying to help everyone and end the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: I think that constitutes, at least a little bit, a Knight of Hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's just my personal opinion, that not having revealed classes is actually kind of a good thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Why_</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And that you should focus on playing your character before focusing on playing your character as a class.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: RS; makes perfect sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: You find more about them and then you can work into it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mmhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'd probably be playing a lot differently if I had a specific class than I do now with it undefined.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Never thought of it that way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mmhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: As is now I'm just playing RS</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Who's basically me but way cool by virtue of having all kinds of toys and mechanical ability.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: *cooler</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: PO is just me with awesome skills. Lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and CP is basically me, but part wolf and with magic powers and some cool gadgets</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: AC is me, but with way more paranoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think most of us play as what our IRL selves would be in the game? which is kinda the /point/ of an alternate reality game if you think about it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: *tendancies. paranoid tendancies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mmhm, pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm just wondering, do you guys think my char uses her time powers too much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: nah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ, nah. being Timey Wimey is what Time Players are SUPPOSED TO DO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I wouldnt think so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Also.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Time is /fucking hard/ in an RP to pull off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: How?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: MS is a chaaracter who's loyal, happy to help, a smiler though holds what's right for his family. His will is his greatest might, and his smile speaks to many with many words</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Because of how it affects events and reality in the RP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: My thing with your time travel is more an irritation via personality</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Though</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: MS sounds like a Knight of Hope too xD</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: RS has this whole "forge your own destiny" mentality to the umpth, kinda hard to keep up with in a Sburb universe whereini inevitability becomes a thing if you're not careful</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Though there's more too him</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He has troubles learning to go about his own intentions</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: PO uses happiness and loudness to hide boiling rage and insecurity</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: MS has problems with his own intentions, and tends to talk to one who helps him think clearly,</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: So honestly</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's like a Page</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: But a page of what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Page of ......Space?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Maybe Mind even.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He sometimes get hit with gloom, but he also tries destrately to keep going as his will works through</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Heart!</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Page of Heart!</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Heart!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I... haven't really thought much about defining my own personality, so idk</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: A Page has a deficit in their Aspect at the beginning</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#1815ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's conflicted on his own intentions, and wishes desprately to know what to do</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Hmmmmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I would say Page or Prince of Heart. Depends on his intentions/his actions on his intentions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Oh! Though he has one thing that defines him the most</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: No matter what, he's always on gaurd for if he does the wrong thing, or something feels bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He will not do it</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: And will even punch himself to stop the madness</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Like, if someone is a foe</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: And no one knows</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Heart. </span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: If he gets the sense of bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He will in his power</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: attempt fully</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: To stop it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Heart is all about the sense of self.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: A page of heart</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... thinking about it, I'd say CP is semi-impulsive if the situation calls for it, but if he has time, he'll think things through first</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: What Would PO be, in your opinion?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I always thought of myself as a Mind player, and that kind of fits...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Now</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: From what we know of Heart players</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No idea. I'm not to good at it generally <a href='@o'>@o</a>@</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Heart players</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Are of self, emotions and being</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hahaha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: A page of heart would have trouble at first, but be extremely loyal and in a sense of just</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: At god tier</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Ha</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Haha</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Heheheheh</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Though wasn't there too many heart players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: What would you say PO was? Based on personality?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's a tough one...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: hm, good question...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: About CP's comment, like that's one of the things that makes me worry about classpect pidgeonholing. Like if you're not a Mind player you can't be smart or calculating, or if you're not an, Iunno, Life player, you can't be optimistic, or anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sometimes being able to pul off an aspect with a more tangental disposition can make your character all the more dynamic</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He could easily fit in a different role</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *pull</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Sburb titles are meant to challenge, after all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Not for all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Well, they can also benifet</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Now, I did say he has trouble with decifering his intentions</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Vriska is the very definition of a Thief of Light just as Meenah/HIC is too Thief of Life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so ending up with something very DIFFERENT than what you are is just as likely as getting a good match</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It either compliments or it inhibits.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: But</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's strong willed, a strong sense of justice</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: But..</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's wild, and if provoked truly</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Hes the potential to hunt you down indefinently</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: DYNAMIC ENTRY!</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: If his family is threatent</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Or friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Dear ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He will hunt you down</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Just because</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He can</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Woooaaahhhh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, a guy you do NOT want to piss off then</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Sounds awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Hurt a friend</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He takes an arm</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Manipulate then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Himself or others</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He will make sure nothing is left</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Even if it's a corpse</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He goes out of his way</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: So others get scared of him if they know this</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Friend or foe</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: And which causes him gloom</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: If a troll did it</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He'll find a way over there</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: And will purposely break all his ties</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Before coming into the kill</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Allies, cohorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He will turn them on him, or kill them trying</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's ruthless</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: PO is very skilled and smart, but very, very hesitant. The real reason he uses a shield is so he can talk to his enemies without hurting them. When there's no turning back, he pulls out his laserpistol and punches the living barg out of things</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Like, think</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Say, a troll was threatening his friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: And had the power to hurt them</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: MS will learn all about him that he can</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: THen use it against him with the others</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: SLowly turning them against that one guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Or if needed, will use what force is needed</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: He keeps it a secret, letting people think he's some badass, but in reality his a borderline pacifist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, MS likes tactical revenge?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Extreme</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Tactical revenge</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: We're talking about by the time this guy knew it</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He will be standing there surrounded by a force</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: And just MS smiling</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Fiendishly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sounds like a Berserk Trigger in "Replay Value"...</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Sorta</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Jeez</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Like, MS is devious</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: No, actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Better to sya</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: If hurt enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He goes out of his way</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: But if say, you start and begin to do it</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: If he sees it budding</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: The person starting it</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Won't like MS</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: oh my.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (actually more like, the face Jade made when Becsprite talked to her)</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Heheheheh</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Like, say you're about to hurt him</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's drastical</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Someone goes to attack MS</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: You stab him with a dagger</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He hits you with a building</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: PO has all the qualities of an unstoppable force, he's just too nice to go full force. Unless It's evil. Then It's game over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He's a defined point of</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: So he only fights evil things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Overkill</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Like, one enemy</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: You sound like a Rager, MS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CP is pretty reserved about things, but he won't hesistate to do what's done to help his friends.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (case in point, the self prototyping to save Ammysprite)</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Kinda hard to put rager</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He just does it</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: He doesn't understand not too</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Yeah, I mean, Gamzee was rage, and he owned everything! (Once he sobered up)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: So you seem like rage</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: But page?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: So</span><br />

<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Prince?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh, ragepage :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Hmm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Anyone else?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8000ff">CMS: Anyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Hm, not really sure... Theif, Knight? idk.</span><br />
