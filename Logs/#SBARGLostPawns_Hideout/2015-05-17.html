<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  is carried by RN to the hideout --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rechargedNintendo <span style="color:#00aa00">[CRN]</span>  lays fl down on fl's bed, connecting the charging cable to him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  // The charging cable sparks, before melting. At least the hub it was connected to didn't explode --</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: god dammit</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: fl what the fuck did you do to yourself</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: you arent user upgradable, im pretty sure at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...I can swap out tons of parts, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  takes off his face for a second, before puitting it back on --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: well, do you know what the fuck happened to your battery?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Nope. Its in my back, so maybe we should take a look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  tries to reach a hatch in his back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rechargedNintendo <span style="color:#00aa00">[CRN]</span>  opens it to look at it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: so, why were you over at LoFaS anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  // ...Okay, there is a tube in there, and it seems to be all weird gunk inside of it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: there seems to be a bunch of weird junk in a tube back here</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well I wanted to try and explore the bubble but ended up trapped on a nightmare version of my land and then went through a painting back to the snow planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  // ...Lots of flashyness. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  reaches and easily closes it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well, I figure if it hasn't run out yet, it likely won't any time soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Or it might in the next few moments.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Then again, you could have a heart attack any moment too, but chances are you won't any time soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  walks over to the punch designix and punches "wqqwwwqq" into a blank card, before putting it into the holopad --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rechargedNintendo <span style="color:#00aa00">[CRN]</span>  a random assortment of junk is holographed, that's not it --</span><br />
