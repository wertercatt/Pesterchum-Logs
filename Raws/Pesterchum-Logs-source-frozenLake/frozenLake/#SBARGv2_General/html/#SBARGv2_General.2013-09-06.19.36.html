[07:48:06] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Interesting idea, getting it done would take a miracle but I'd be game</span><br />
[07:48:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: or we could just have it  freeform and have a ref to stop godmodding</span><br />

[07:51:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Meh. I don't really like the d20 system just because it's simply OOC luck, not so much character skill.</span><br />

[07:52:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: also it shouldnt be a bracket system it should be a grid system</span><br />
[07:53:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so nobody loses in the first round and then just watches bored for  the rest of it</span><br />
