[05:31:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah</span><br />
[05:31:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how do I register my nick</span><br />

[05:31:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: good afternoon, guys</span><br />
[05:31:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anything interesting happening?</span><br />
[05:31:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey Kimura</span><br />
[05:31:32] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: heya CP</span><br />
[05:31:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We were just talking about Athena's books.</span><br />
[05:31:40] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: mhm</span><br />
[05:31:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: theres one on your land!</span><br />
[05:31:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, Help==&gt;NickServ, then "register [password] [email]"</span><br />
[05:32:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but not one on mine yet.</span><br />
[05:32:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thanks</span><br />
[05:32:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[05:32:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what books?</span><br />
[05:33:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I assume most people are at the <span style="color:#bacafe">Bacafe</span> right now?</span><br />
[05:33:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Athena tends to write her own books on various topics, when she is bored. Lands and their history being one of said topics, apparently.</span><br />
[05:33:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -I'm guessing so,  yeah.</span><br />
[05:34:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not sure if registered right</span><br />
[05:34:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "[05:32:29] NS: Nickname fLmun registered under your account: *pcc31@*.client.mchsi.com"</span><br />
[05:34:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is that right?</span><br />
[05:34:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: registering doesn't really do much for the average pesterchum user, since it doesn't prevent someone from logging in as you without knowing the pw</span><br />
[05:35:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, that's what's supposed to happen</span><br />
[05:35:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, thanks.</span><br />
[05:35:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I thought that my email was supposed to go at the end.</span><br />
[05:35:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: only thing registering is good for on PC is for ghosting nicks (which I assume is your reason), and for auto-op if you have it on a memo.</span><br />
[05:36:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Neat.</span><br />
[05:36:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thanks</span><br />
[05:36:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To you and RS.</span><br />
[05:36:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS for telling me to do it</span><br />
[05:37:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and you for telling me how.</span><br />
[05:37:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, we have books.</span><br />
[05:38:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool. how do I get one for my land if there is one?</span><br />
[05:39:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its in the library.</span><br />
[05:39:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If FL really did buy a copy of it, then it should be at the HQ or something. If not, then its for sale at my land shops, most likely. However, the prices are insane, there.</span><br />
[05:39:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I did.</span><br />
[05:39:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I bought all of the books that were for sale at that shop.</span><br />
[05:40:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: took out a chunk of money but still.</span><br />
[05:40:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ah, okay.</span><br />
[05:40:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <a href='http://pastebin.com/HKR2N3LA'>http://pastebin.com/HKR2N3LA</a> ))</span><br />

[05:42:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'm probably gonna post my fray list later this week... assuming I finish writing my dungeon and can run it this week, since the Light/Void motif I still have to think up is gonna be part of the boss-loot))</span><br />

[05:46:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Charred Coda is a Boatmurdered reference. ))</span><br />
[05:46:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ALL BURN ))</span><br />
[05:53:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Shepard's Strings is named after the Shepard's Tone. ))</span><br />
[05:53:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( endless drumbeat is obvious compared to the music ))</span><br />
[05:54:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( and a Capriccio is a spirited song. ))</span><br />
[05:54:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( which is rather made up on the spot ))</span><br />
[05:57:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( it used to be Spirit Buffer but NOW BUFFERING doesn't seem to be a good enough pun. ))</span><br />
[05:58:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, yeah...</span><br />
[05:59:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should buy "Blitz Madrigal".</span><br />
[05:59:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It seems to be my Heart/Heart/Heart+ Fraymotif.</span><br />
[05:59:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: needs at least three heart players.</span><br />
[06:00:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that seems more doable then some of the alternatives.</span><br />
[06:00:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still... is it worth the 100,000 Boonbucks?</span><br />
[06:01:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((...So is the general idea that for a Fray to work each person who needs to partake has to have obtained it?))</span><br />
[06:01:49] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((presumably by buying it on their own planet?))</span><br />
[06:01:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( no ))</span><br />
[06:01:57] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Yeah. ]]</span><br />

[06:02:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: depends. Heart's not a super-common aspect, I think we only have four or five of them... and also depends on how many boonbonds you have.</span><br />
[06:02:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Nope. It's available to both players. It's generally assumed that both have to have it for it to work. ]]</span><br />
[06:02:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have 4 and 1/3 boonbonds.</span><br />
[06:02:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: of /course/ you do :P</span><br />
[06:03:01] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ It'd be like trying to play a game on a disc with your friend on two consoles but you only have one disc. ]]</span><br />
[06:03:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((huh, good analogy actually.))</span><br />
[06:03:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( well then how the /fuck/ is Sburban Finale gonna work with its price of 1 BILLION BOON BONDS. ))</span><br />
[06:03:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( actually, its like DS download play. ))</span><br />
[06:03:27] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( it's important to know your part in a song, really. ))</span><br />

[06:03:54] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( how can you have a duet, a trio, or a quartet if your partner doesn't know their part? ))</span><br />
[06:04:08] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( or partners. y'know. ))</span><br />
[06:04:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( well if you are going to go with that then FL is gonna be a complete and utter asshole and support Fraymotif piracy. ))</span><br />
[06:04:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok, compromise then. it's possible to use a combo fray if only one person owns it, but it's significantly weaker unless everyone owns it.))</span><br />
[06:04:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( but then how does that work with everyone having different Fraymotif Combos? ))</span><br />
[06:05:09] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Mhm. In the case of joint fraymotifs they only involve two people, but they'd both need them unlocked to use it. ]]</span><br />
[06:05:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I think its like the lead in the fraymotif, the buyer in this case, starts, then the others join in. ))</span><br />
[06:06:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And it would help allow for different Heart/Void fraymotifs for example. ))</span><br />
[06:06:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( maybe one where Void is the lead instead of Heart. ))</span><br />
[06:06:19] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ A joint fraymotif is as specialized as a personal one. It's used when both players have it unlocked, at least that's the general format. ]]</span><br />

[06:06:45] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Discussing. ]]</span><br />

[06:07:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( and its a /debate/ ))</span><br />
[06:07:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ So? Message the GM then. ]]</span><br />
[06:07:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( lets do the debate first ))</span><br />
[06:08:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Nah. Message the GM so we can take as little time on this. ]]</span><br />
[06:09:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Pros of the download play method is that only one person has to buy for high priced fraymotifs, and we can have fraymotifs that kinda also support class and other stuff. ))</span><br />
[06:09:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( what are the cons? ))</span><br />
[06:09:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ The cons are you're being a bit of a jackass about it. ]]</span><br />
[06:10:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lets see... one could start a fraymotif with a BRAND NEW PLAYER... people might need to earn fraymotifs... anything else? ))</span><br />
[06:10:30] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ I'd rather we just ask him. This doesn't have a point. ]]</span><br />
[06:10:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( he isn't on pesterchum ))</span><br />
[06:11:14] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Cons are it means you have an inexperienced player using a fraymotif they don't actually know, how to use it, or what it does. ]]</span><br />
[06:11:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Then this just so happens to be a bigger waste of time than I already thought it to be :T ]]</span><br />
[06:12:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( but noone knows what a fraymotif does before they use it, even if they bought it! ))</span><br />
[06:12:35] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Prove that. ]]</span><br />
[06:12:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that's why I suggested the "you can do it with only one buyer, but it's meganerfed unless everyone owns it" thing.))</span><br />
[06:13:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( FL doesn't know what most of his stuff does. ))</span><br />

[06:13:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( you don't have canon examples for the other either. ))</span><br />
[06:13:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it would help if fraymotifs were explained better in canon...))</span><br />
[06:13:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ^ ))</span><br />
[06:14:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ And as such it doesn't mean you're right. The proper way to do this is just to ask the GM when they're online. ]]</span><br />

[06:15:08] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: FL, if you would like to learn more about the proper names for amounts of boonbucks, I suggest doing some reading next time instead of sending me an ask.</span><br />

[06:15:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hey! long time no see</span><br />
[06:15:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: got a second?</span><br />
[06:15:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but that does help with the value of what 10^12 boondollars is...</span><br />
[06:16:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: doesn't*</span><br />
[06:17:03] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: take that as a no</span><br />
[06:17:04] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ouch</span><br />
[06:17:06] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: It does indeed.</span><br />
[06:17:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that 10^6 is Boonbucks, and 10^18 is Boonbonds...</span><br />
[06:17:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but John once got an empty booncase, so...</span><br />
[06:17:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it was mentioned that it was worthless...</span><br />
[06:17:35] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Well, it's an estimate that a Booncase is worth 10^12.</span><br />
[06:17:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When full of boonbucks?</span><br />
[06:18:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cause thats a million boonbucks, and well, not sure that would fit in there.</span><br />
[06:18:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but then again it might be bigger on the inside.</span><br />
[06:18:49] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Actually, it is one trillion.</span><br />
[06:18:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if it is that means I shelled out one million boonbucks on books alone.</span><br />
[06:19:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, the standard is boondollars.</span><br />
[06:19:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not boonbucks.</span><br />
[06:19:10] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Ah, I see.</span><br />
[06:19:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1 boonbuck is 1000000 boondollars.</span><br />
[06:19:19] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: I do not quite understand this article.</span><br />
[06:19:31] <span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: So I will leave you to figure it out.</span><br />
[06:20:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...still don't know if a boonbank is 10^24 boondollars or just 10^21.</span><br />
[06:21:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, it makes sense if its just 1000 boonbonds if rounding up sounds correct...</span><br />
[06:22:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but then that would set a boonmint at 10^24 instead of 10^30 or 10^27.</span><br />
[06:22:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . .</span><br />
[06:22:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even HAVE a boonbank yet.</span><br />
[06:23:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously 4 and 1/3rd isn't that many boonbonds.</span><br />
[06:25:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...how did we get from discussing whether or not everyone has to own a group fraymotif to use it or if only one person has to, to discussing the proper names of boon denominations?</span><br />

[07:41:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you just need to find a 1x prototyped sprite thats a person.</span><br />
[07:42:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I doubt that exists</span><br />
[07:42:07] <span style="color:#1f1f1f">CLC: ..bec▲use...</span><br />
[07:42:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus that would be creepy</span><br />
[07:42:31] <span style="color:#1f1f1f">CLC: ...um...</span><br />
[07:42:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not to mention, sprites can't merge-proto like that.</span><br />
[07:42:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You want to be a real boy?</span><br />
[07:42:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is shot for joke --</span><br />
[07:42:57] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: dude not cool</span><br />
[07:43:01] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...FL I will slap you</span><br />
[07:43:04] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: so hard</span><br />
[07:43:39] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think thats a low blow and im me</span><br />
[07:43:54] <span style="color:#1f1f1f">CLC: ....</span><br />

[07:45:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in principle though, yes Elsey, it is possible. I learned within the first week or so how to go from Jadesprite-style human-with-wolf-features-and-sprite-tail appearance to "just a wolf with a hat and sprite-coloring"...</span><br />
[07:45:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: owowowo- oh.</span><br />
[07:46:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure if all sprites have the ability, but it's proof of concept at least</span><br />
[07:46:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Now /be nice/</span></span><br />
[07:46:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why don't you like being you?</span><br />
[07:46:51] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: um..FL</span><br />
