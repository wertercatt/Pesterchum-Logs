<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: pretty awesome i can't lie</span><br />
SA: i kept watching you people die<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: did we have roles from the game or did we get like unique titles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...oh uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...less cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL has had three dreams of nightmares.</span><br />
SA: also some characters from the game itself<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Crow Dream, with Being finished off instead of being left to die.</span><br />
SA: like it ran in a game format??<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The AI Dream, which was about Lost of senses, unable to protect ones self.</span><br />
SA: pick a choice which influences everything<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the Glitch Dream, where it involved his Fear of losing others.</span><br />
SA: it morphed from you guys to a weird version of the game itself and back again<br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: have you ever used a dream dictionary thing?</span><br />
SA: it just went off the rails into batshit insane. no.<br />
SA: but i had to watch some of you die then it kept looping on repeat<br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :/</span><br />
SA: this was worse than the other one where I was being forced to eat a human fucking brain. what.<br />

SA: shouldn't be said sorry<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah it's okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: it's fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think I had really weird dreams a few years back, or at least relatively consistant ones in their oddity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Trains and falling.</span><br />
SA: ugh. all this didn't start happening until several days ago.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I used to have dreams about train stations, where I'd invariably end up falling onto the tracks</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And falling...I used to dream I was in a crazy abyss, with nothing but rails and shit everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: the worst nightmare I ever had was one where I was in bed and it was rea!!y dark and I was !ike !ifted out of bed</span><br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: by !ike magic or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And invariably I'd just fall off, end up falling for what seemed like ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: and I cou!dn't see who it was</span><br />
SA: also the mastermind was forcing everyone to put on a performance in front of an audience in a grand mockery of the trial and everyone was alive<br />
SA: only for them to announce how each died and they died again<br />
SA: i think i ran her over with a train.<br />
SA puts hands to face and lies down<br />
SA: yeah idek anymore i just would like to stop remembering dreams like these<br />
LL what happened in your dream next<br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: I dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: I just got !ifted out of bed</span><br />

hahahaha really?<br />
that sounds... wow<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not that it's like a pile of random polygon glitches, I just mean that there is literally no pattern to my dreams, except a high "why the fuck?" factor...</span><br />
yeah that<br />
seems to be the same with me<br />
i don't usually remember dreaming at all, mostly a blank white/dark haze<br />
I get like two to three hours sleep, fuck if I know what I do then.<br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: One of my favorite things heading into v2 was the relatively lack of semi-rabid shipping, shipping walls, relationships up the wazoo bordering on romantic plot tumor in the best case and ass-deep into RPT in the worst.</span><br />

<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: idk don't see any Denizens around</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thing is, FL already mentioned running out of healing items in the past, and visited ashes place commenting about the GUN Drive which came back and hit him in the face, and that lead to the shipping wall...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you change that, it causes one HELL of time shenanigans, much worse than the one you would have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which is why my ORIGINAL assumption, and the one that's the most temporally safe, is that we did OOC-saturday's part IC-saturday, /left the dungeon and went home/, and /returned IC-today to finish/.</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">well</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span>'re pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: well i try to refer to people with whatever pronouns they prefer if i can help it</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span>'re pretty much something you can't help</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Sure, EP, I am if you want me to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> we got rid of all the existing gender roles</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">new</span> ones would appear</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: 99% of the time i dont remember anyone's gender whether they're cis or trans</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Sure. Probably. But I'm just like, whatever roles someone decides they want to have are their own business. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> all gender role perceptions were "deleted"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so if i accidentally misgender somebody on here, which i dont think i have yet, dont take it too personally because i do it to everybody i dont know irl</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: well like i say i am going to fight my hypothetical future son being told to hide his emotions</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: because that has fucked me up personally in so many ways</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but if you dont thats pretty much your business</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but like its a relationship dealbreaker for me if she doesn't want kids</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i really want to raise another human being for some reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: This might sound really mean, but I think I have this dislike for kids or something. Like, there are plenty of cool kids, and when I was a kid, kids were cool, but then there are a lot of annoying ones. I was both annoying and cool, but still, the annoying part is the part I dislike. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">one</span> of the saddest part of my situation is that I can't get pregnant.</span><br />
