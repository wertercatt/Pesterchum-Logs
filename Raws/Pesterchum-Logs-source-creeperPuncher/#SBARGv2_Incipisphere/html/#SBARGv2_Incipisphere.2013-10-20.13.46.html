<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ FL, what I can see as your problem is that you seem to think in unchanging absolutes. You think to yourself "I am a worthless asshole" and then think that will never change. The fact of the matter is that this game /requires/ that you change yourself. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Your Classpect is not just a title it is a /challenge/, a call to arms for your to change your ways and try something new. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The point of the game is to grow and reach new heights as a person. If you think you are worthless then work to change that. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Well lets break it down Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ A rogue steals but steals for the benefit of others. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Now this doesn't mean you can't benefit yourself. Your title is how you impact reality and so its an indication of both your nature and how you act. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or at least it's supposed to be. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As a rogue you tend to go off on your own and do what you can for others. You are independent by nature as well. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Great</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ While you may not realize it, you are also self-sacrificing but you tend to go a bit far with it. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Huh... Let Me Guess. Scared?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm not Heart is difficult to quantify. Like Mind it is one of the "personal" Aspects (in contrast to say Blood and Breath which are social and Rage and Hope which are emotional) Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you knew what the inside of my heart looked like right now... well, I cant use it to help me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Why Not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Heart is the defining aspect of a person. Its the 'inner' verses Mind's 'outer'. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So Heart is the aspect of the soul, the definition of things, the 'heart' of the matter, and indentity itself. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The soul is the defining aspect of humanity. Its their identity and their core self that they hide from the world within their consciousness. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Sure you can steal souls but more importantly you are the one who can dig deeper into the inner selves of others and bring their true selves to light. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Well... Maybe eh can use his powers like the kid from Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ When you steal something you reveal it, which is a part of your nature as outlined by the classpect. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: *he</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As an example, Mind is the 'outer' aspect of a person meaning its the thoughts, choices, and the facades/mental walls we put around our Heart to defend ourselves. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So as a Prince of Mind I've realized that I am very very good at piercing right through those facades and getting to the Heart of the matter. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You tell me I should be independent, and well, I'm concerned about what alot of people think about me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ But that is not just /because/ I am a Prince of Mind, its just who I am. The title just highlighted that. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Then ask for them to tell you truthfully.  Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Its often better to act and find out than to wallow in indecision. Σ</span><br />
