<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  The Land of Spells and Echoes is, as per usual, split into three distinct biomes, the first of which would likely draw their attention first off. Dusty desert landscape and cracked earth are the name of the game regarding landscape, dotted by rune-covered obelisks and runes along with consort villages of varying size. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perfectionistOriginator <span style="color:#d3661d">[CPO]</span>  inspects the area. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d3661d">CPO: It seems this is the first time I have been to LoSaE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  but for the most attentive things are somewhat different from before. Around the villages the land seems healthier, lush with grass in places --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the largest consort village, the one they congregate at for the sake of convinence, is the best off, in that regard. A sign near the village entrance (decorated with tassles and streamers) bears the word "Sandybrae", and throughout penguin consorts seem to be in quite the cheerful mood. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  himself is leaning against a house by the entrance, noting the others with a nod and a walk over. --</span><br />
