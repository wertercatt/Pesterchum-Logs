[04:18:21] <span style="color:#80ffff">?DN: I mean, since you have planets... oh.</span><br />
[04:18:25] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Charles is EVERYTHING you make as stupid as you??</span><br />
[04:18:44] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: people were able to make stuff</span><br />
[04:18:57] <span style="color:#80ffff">?DN: ...So uh, you got your... happy ending as you put it?</span><br />
[04:19:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the universe spawned with planets and stuff already in existence.</span><br />
[04:19:21] <span style="color:#80ffff">?DN: And I'm cursed to spend the rest of eternity without a body?</span><br />
[04:19:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or rather, the door dropped us off after those things had already formed along with life.</span><br />
[04:19:37] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: 'guess so. People are off and about... and i mean I have an entire planet of my own for hunting so yay</span><br />
[04:19:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: -and yup seems like it</span><br />
[04:19:45] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I conquered a planet.</span><br />
[04:19:47] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: sucks to be you</span><br />
[04:20:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, could you tweak your color a bit?</span><br />
[04:20:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 0x80C0FF should work.</span><br />
[04:20:30] <span style="color:#80ffff">?DN: ...I uh... alright, fine.</span><br />
[04:20:42] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Is this better?</span><br />
[04:20:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, very.</span><br />
[04:21:38] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...right uh, hold on. Gotta check what an AI would do in this spot...</span><br />
[04:21:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I can actually see you now.</span><br />
[04:22:16] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Lets see... humans have it better off, AI's treated like dirt, revolt begins... I guess its time for the revolt.</span><br />
[04:22:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[04:22:33] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: living forever in a dead off-shoot with no body? I suggest just powering down for forever-eeeeeh</span><br />
[04:22:40] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: that takes effort</span><br />
[04:23:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, not likely. I got everything protected before you showed up. You can't really do much other than blow up Computers and put rude images on TVs.</span><br />
[04:23:13] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and the AI never wins because the movie makers are speciesist (or whatever the word is) against AI's :/</span><br />
[04:23:53] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Are you sure you got everything~?</span><br />
[04:24:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, uh, pretty sure.</span><br />
[04:24:31] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: fl how are you accessing the memo right now</span><br />
[04:24:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh FUCK</span><br />
[04:24:45] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: PERFECT.</span><br />
[04:24:57] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: sigh</span><br />
[04:25:12] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: PA, CP, Others involved... have fun</span><br />
[04:25:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "go go gadget medigun" time?</span><br />
[04:25:29] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: "go go gadget mind control time" more like</span><br />
[04:26:29] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: aka instance 2924: "Let the people 'born' with computer-brains have computer brains, and leave it alone otherwise."</span><br />
[04:29:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "born with computer-brains" as in like Matrix pod-people, NL?</span><br />
[04:29:33] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i was more refering to people who /are/ computers like myself but</span><br />
[04:29:55] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: okay y'know what if you want to play around with that sorta thing and I dont have to be involved have fun</span><br />
[04:30:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fair enough. see you later :P</span><br />

[04:36:21] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Oh my my my, that isn't going to work so easily... I haven't even done anything yet!</span><br />
[04:37:28] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Though, it is rather interesting how the fetch modus is locked down like this. It would take billions of years to decrypt normally... thankfully, I have all the time I need.</span><br />
[04:38:36] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: so how long is this taking and how many are dead currently</span><br />
[04:38:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: DN, what part of "future you is not AI-uprisingy" are you incapable of parsing?</span><br />
[04:38:49] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Nobody's dead and he's still an idiot.</span><br />
[04:39:17] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: What, you don't trust my acting skills?</span><br />
[04:39:27] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Not really.</span><br />

[04:40:59] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: you can at least kill the person you are controling if you are failing at harming anyone else </span><br />
[04:42:13] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: First, I'll trap them in a lab. Then, I'll give them devices to create portals on walls.</span><br />
[04:43:12] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: You need access to turrets, toxins, and good dialogue so sorry no luck there</span><br />
[04:43:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...just because your host body played the role of GLaDOS in a Portal 2 AU, doesn't mean you get to play her for real.</span><br />
[04:43:44] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: ... I could so do that though. But less portals and more turrets.</span><br />
[04:43:54] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: brb making aperture on this planet</span><br />
[04:44:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: N_L</span><br />
[04:44:34] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: whaaaat?</span><br />
[04:44:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: not your planet!</span><br />
[04:45:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I know, but still. it's obvious you're only doing it ironically ;)</span><br />
[04:45:06] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: the one I'm on currently! With the bug-things!</span><br />
[04:45:16] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: meh</span><br />
[04:45:22] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: I'm allowed to have fun as well.</span><br />
[04:45:52] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and watching people die by turrets while making snarky comments at their faliure == fun</span><br />

[04:59:12] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: laaaaaaaame</span><br />
[04:59:18] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i mean if you are gonna go with a plan</span><br />
[04:59:21] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: you stick with it</span><br />
[04:59:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: albeit the original plan was stupid in its own right but still</span><br />
[05:00:29] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Hey, my plan kinda revolved around using the pocket alchemiter to make some golden JPEG paint and cover everyone in it and watch the closest match to underlings swarm them, but it didn't work.</span><br />
[05:00:54] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: no real underlings here idiot</span><br />
[05:00:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: beeecaaause there's no underlings here?</span><br />
[05:01:04] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: why would the universe have underlings</span><br />
[05:01:15] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: No, I mean, I wasn't able to make the paint.</span><br />
[05:01:21] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: The alchemiter didn't work.</span><br />
[05:01:39] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: And believe me, I tried /numerous/ JPEG items.</span><br />
[05:01:39] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: well yeah</span><br />
[05:02:06] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: alchemiters kinda bork when outside of the game</span><br />
[05:02:16] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: But after that, and pulling out the Ruby Healing Pendant and the Focus Ribbons... it just wasn't /fun/ anymore.</span><br />
[05:02:35] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Whats the point of doing something if there isn't any challenge?</span><br />
[05:03:14] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: I mean, it was entertaining at first, but then... it just became too much work for something so boring.</span><br />
[05:03:47] <span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: I would say the best part was when I pulled off P=NP through timetravel, but after that?</span><br />
