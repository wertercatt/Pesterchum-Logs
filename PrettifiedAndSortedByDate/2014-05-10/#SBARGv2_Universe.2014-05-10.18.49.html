[06:55] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: So you're wrong again</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: ((I don't know what that is, am I going to be scarred if I look it up))</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: well shit</span><br />

[07:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hell no</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: considering i'm one of the few people with access to a lot of your human stuff</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: that's probably the reason why</span><br />
[07:03] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: Let's see, so Pokemon, Drain Cleaner, and Science</span><br />
[07:03] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: is that what humans do all day?</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: science? i hate science</span><br />
[07:07] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: The research team i'm on would like permission to go to your planet at a later date, btw</span><br />
[07:09] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: the higher ups have decided to raise you to a higher level of priority for whatever reason</span><br />
[07:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[07:10] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: what do you mean "&gt;:?"</span><br />

[07:11] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: you just haven't learned enough about it yet</span><br />
[07:11] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: i'm pretty much the only competent guy around these parts, and I'm giving you absolute clearance to all of our planet's facilities</span><br />
[07:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I'm pointing out you don't have that authority.</span><br />
[07:12] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: here's the thing</span><br />
[07:12] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: It's kind of my job to research you humans</span><br />
[07:13] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: like, I get money for just dicking around in here and occasionally sending in research</span><br />
[07:14] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: so they want me to see about getting clearance to head over to your planet do some research on it and junk</span><br />
[07:15] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: it'd be like... a week at most</span><br />
[07:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[07:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the point is, the people that /do/ have authorization to allow that, haven't been on the memo in weeks...</span><br />
[07:15] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: ah...</span><br />
[07:17] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: ((what did happen? I'm pretty sure I remember it being more lively when I checked it out a while back))</span><br />
[07:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((NN happened. or to be more specific, an argument broke out a month and a half ago, and most of the regulars said "fuck this shit" and left))</span><br />
[07:18] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: ((oh :/))</span><br />

[07:21] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: ?</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Just 'cause I'm busy with /fun/ people doesn't mean you get to write me off, I'm hella competant!</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: And Kim's...Well yeah he's competant. Competant was never his problem, not really</span><br />
[07:22] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: i'm gonna write a rap out of this memo</span><br />
[07:23] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: did anyone say you weren't, though?</span><br />

[07:46] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: uh</span><br />
[07:46] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: other pokemon in the same egg group?</span><br />
[07:46] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: but why would you want to breed one</span><br />
[07:46] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: they're lame</span><br />
[07:46] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: yeah but what are they</span><br />
[07:47] <span style="color:#3d8d00">CVI: because apparently they're rare so if Pokemon ever becomes main stream on my planet, i can trade them off for cool shit</span><br />

[08:17] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: If you defeat Blissey, for example, you'll be getting HP EVs.</span><br />
[08:17] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: In later stages of training, this essentially leads to customization. Allocation of stats.</span><br />
