[07:15:19] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Still.</span><br />
[07:15:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For the random visitor, your mind wipe would work...</span><br />
[07:15:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but for people that are sent... thats when issues arise.</span><br />
[07:16:03] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm...</span><br />
[07:16:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And it's not a mind-wipe. Its honestly worse than that, and it's why I feel bad for suggesting that in the first place.</span><br />
[07:17:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, and it just isn't cost effective to hunt down every visitor and wipe their minds...</span><br />
[07:17:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, I will start work on masking the signal for the Server...</span><br />
[07:17:59] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That would be a good idea, yeah...</span><br />
[07:18:52] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And it's honestly not something I would want to do, really. It's something that would have to be done, if I went along that route.</span><br />
[07:19:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I just... not everyone is going to be so friendly.</span><br />
[07:20:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well yeah he did start out with attacking my security system</span><br />
[07:20:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, he thought we worked for eggman</span><br />
[07:20:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah... still.</span><br />
[07:21:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Space travel is costly. People will want rewards for their efforts, in one form or another.</span><br />
[07:21:24] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Meeting them on their planets is one thing.</span><br />
[07:21:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well yeah.</span><br />
[07:21:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Them meeting us...</span><br />
[07:21:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The things most people will get out of intergalactic travel is cultural and technological.</span><br />
[07:22:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Honestly, I think we should open ourselves up to trade.</span><br />
[07:22:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think aliens might have some really good pop culture.</span><br />
[07:22:40] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Tch... maybe.</span><br />
[07:24:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah, resources can be collected from meteors and lifeless planets.</span><br />
[07:24:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Invasions are pointless.</span><br />
[07:25:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you want to enslave the popluation, but if you are advanced enough to make it into deep space, one could make robots.</span><br />
[07:25:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so the only reason one would have slaves is for cultural reasons.</span><br />
[07:26:35] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed... and we players would sure make for some annoying pets.</span><br />
[07:27:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Assuming we didn't prevent ourselves from becoming slaves with our powers</span><br />
