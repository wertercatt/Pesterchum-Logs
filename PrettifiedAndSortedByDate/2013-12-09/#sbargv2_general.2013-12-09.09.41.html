<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">she</span>'s around the very low to moderate range (depending on some things)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (and not checking some things that /everyone/ in SBURB can do like taking out 11 imps at once)</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but theres one thing that isnt on the litmus test afaik thats a /pretty big deal/ in hs</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">what</span>'s that</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and thats that she has probably dealt with the least despair of anyone in the comic</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span>'s like saying</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> feferi is a sue bc she only died and aside from that hasn't had any despair</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">aside</span> from the small bit of eridan drama</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no feferi has plenty of anti-sue factors</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">like</span>?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the fact that shes pretty heavily implied to be a shitty emperor...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: having to delegate the (insert lusus name) duties to eridan</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and that wasnt really a "small bit" of eridan drama either</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">contrariwise</span> I could say that was a point for being a sue; being too "nice" to do that even though that makes no sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">for</span> a troll</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">in</span> which every bit of culture revolves around not nice things so she is unrealistic in being nice for no good reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but still, the point is that /just about everything goes right/ for kanaya</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: except for the shit that affected the entire troll session</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">kanaya</span> has an alcoholic gf, got shot through the stomach, has a clown that she caNNot kill despite wanting revenge on, has to deal with the guilt of not doing anything about gamter even though rose told her it was abusive, had to spend a while getting over Vriska, was worried sick about Rose for a while because of how she went grimdark</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok first of all im gonna call just about anything gamzee-related something that effects the entire session</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think thats fair</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">gamter</span></span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">in</span> the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">in</span> the furthest ring</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">B</span>)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">B</span>)))))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">BBBBB</span>))))))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you know what i meant</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: :smooooooooooooooooOoOOoOoooth:</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">well</span> I would think</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, the gamter thing seems sorta minor in the grand scope of things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> I guesss that could count, as long as you still count the revenge thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: THANK YOU</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (because that only effects kanaya)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (no one else cares about her revengeboner)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also, im gonna say "things that happen to rose that upset kanaya" are fairly minor compared to whats happened to everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so that leaves</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: getting over vriska, and being injured and then healed almost immediately</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span>'d still count those</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so still not much compared to everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span> weren't that much but they do add up</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> the point is that really being a mary sue isn't about being too good</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s about taking up the focus</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">because</span> you're so overly good</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">kanaya</span> is still pretty background of a char even though she's more prominent</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">nowadays</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also tbh "i care too much about my friends weh weh" is a very sue-ish problem to have</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">while</span> she still is a bit overly good it's not in your face</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s pretty realistic</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">of</span> a problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> sues tend to use because they don't want to be sues</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah but when thats basically the only problem you have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not sure wether the stuff about having the resoponsability of trying to continue the troll race is a sue-ish thing in this context or not. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">yeah</span> that's whne it's sue-ish</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> would think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah having the responsibility to carry the troll race is a bit sue-ish too</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> that's not too sue-ish given that it realistically shows "oh crap this is stressful what if everything goes wrong"</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">a</span> bit sue-ish</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> not too much</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (though it does kind of throw it in the background)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (the stress)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: comes a bit too close to "i just want to be normal"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: which is so sueish jesus</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">thus</span> says I, the undercover cop</span><br />
One of the people I know, a friend is hosting a giant Christmas dinner.<br />
And I can't go. I have the money there by bus.<br />
I have a passport and stuff but I can't go either way.<br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ... why do you need a passport</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">those</span> are for going to international -- oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">canada</span> exists</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">sorry</span> canada</span><br />
It's an example, one of my other friends is from Canada and they're able to go.<br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">canada</span> apologizes of course</span><br />
...Yeah. Just wanted to vent.<br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: /hugs you</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> understand</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Though that argument becomes much harder when someone starts assigning points to running over things in a car.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">you</span>'d think it'd be harder for them to defend 'they're murderers and rapists' given the obvious black humor</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Basically I didn't want to explain Homestuck to them.</span><br />
