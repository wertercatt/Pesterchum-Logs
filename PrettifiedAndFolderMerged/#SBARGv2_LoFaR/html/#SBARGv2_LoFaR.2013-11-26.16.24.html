<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  uncaptchalogues a cigarette, catching it in his mouth as it lights itself up, a little jet of flame appearing below it. He does in fact smell like flowers and trees. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  incense mostly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ... So that's why I smelled incense.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of walks out of range of the smoke --</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It ain't bad Emp don't get all preachy at me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: No, not that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Don't like the smell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  inhales deeply once they're outside away from the smoke... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I frankly don't care as long as it's not addictive and you're not dying from it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSJ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Just... don't do it in like. Cramped spaces.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Otherwise do whatever, the smell's oddly appealind.</span><br />
