<span style="color:#005400">CSL: names don't literally give power unless you're in a cheesy fantasy novel</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What makes a sword famous? I think...Most of the time it's what's done with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005400">CSL: but as someone who has way too many swords, enemies fear "famous" ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#005400">CSL: i think its a game mechanic</span><br />

<span style="color:#005400">CSL: why no alchemy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because I've gotta make it myself.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There'll be some alchemy after but that's more for storage and probably won't affect the thing itself aside from Object Duality.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005400">CSL: is this like something the denizen requires</span><br />
<span style="color:#005400">CSL: or are you doing it out of some sense of honor</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Honor's got nothing to do with it. I've gotta be /better/ then him, be a better inventor and craftsman then him. That means beating his sword with a better one, of my making.</span><br />
