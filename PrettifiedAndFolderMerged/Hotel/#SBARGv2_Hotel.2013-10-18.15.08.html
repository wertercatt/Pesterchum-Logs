… But only slightly.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  what does it smell like? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nonsense, it's a fire squid.</span><br />
The squid is. Y'know. Thinking fire squid things.<br />

The orb of water smashes onto the dome. Which Alanna set up specifically to prevent herself from getting splashed earlier.<br />
