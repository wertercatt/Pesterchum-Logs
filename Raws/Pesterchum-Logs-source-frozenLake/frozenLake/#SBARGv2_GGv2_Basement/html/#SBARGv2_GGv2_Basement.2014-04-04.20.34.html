[20:34:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0078f0">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 GGV2 BASEMENT.</span><br />
[20:38:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is holding the bit of his hand that he just cut. --</span><br />
[20:38:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  slowly begins to draw a circle. --</span><br />
[20:40:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  starts making a five pointed star, and begins to place random objects in it. --</span><br />
[20:40:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[20:40:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  comes downstairs --</span><br />
[20:40:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, what are you doing.</span><br />
[20:40:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // Some Cheese. A doll. A heart. A Touhou CD. and- --</span><br />
[20:40:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  looks up from the circle of his own blood --</span><br />
[20:40:51] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...ummmm</span><br />
[20:41:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, no. this isn't gonna do anything.</span><br />
[20:42:08] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: How do you know.</span><br />
[20:42:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  slowly sets a miniature scythe down. --</span><br />
[20:42:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  scribbles over the drawing, removing the ink/blood --</span><br />
[20:42:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // the blood is removed. --</span><br />
[20:43:01] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[20:43:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because she died on game terms.</span><br />
[20:43:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I don't give a fuck if it was game terms or not, she is coming /back/</span><br />
[20:43:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you want to revive her, it's /only/ going to be possible on game terms.</span><br />
[20:44:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[20:45:04] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So be it.</span><br />
[20:45:29] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I'll collect her body and head to a barren wasteland of a planet, and launch a new instance of the game.</span><br />
[20:45:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and prototype her?</span><br />
[20:46:06] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I will steal a meteor, and bring her new form back through the portal.</span><br />
[20:46:17] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...yeah, that /is/ the plan.</span><br />
[20:47:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[20:47:35] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I don't know how the game would react to someone who has already ascended beginning a new session... but at least I'll be able to bring her back.</span><br />
[20:48:02] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...But I would need someone's help to prevent complete disaster.</span><br />
[20:48:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um... actually... it'd react how Chronos happened, if I read the Pre-Scratch stuff correctly.</span><br />
[20:50:09] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
[20:50:45] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...So I would have to convince some non players to start up the game instead.</span><br />
[20:51:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. you'd have to somehow get her single-tier-prototyped without being a player or entering the game yourself.</span><br />
[20:52:04] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: No, I could enter the game as a guardian of sorts.</span><br />
[20:52:22] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: After all, Niki's brother Jake survived.</span><br />
[20:52:39] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So it means that myth is busted.</span><br />
[20:53:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I mean for safety reasons of you having been a player before... but then again...</span><br />
[20:54:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[20:54:27] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[20:54:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  realizes that the slight wound he has made has closed up, and his ruby necklace is glowing slightly. --</span><br />
[20:55:02] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...Oh. Its... working again.</span><br />
[20:55:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh. mmk</span><br />
[20:57:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads back upstairs --</span><br />
