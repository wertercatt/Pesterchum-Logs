[09:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically weaponized miniature suns.</span><br />

[09:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Can you do that?</span><br />
[09:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I could... but I think the better questions is... would I?</span><br />

[09:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why would you want to do something that bad?</span><br />
[09:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That... thats one of the things I have sworn not to do... not on that big of a level...</span><br />
[09:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *is staring at him, wide-eyed* /You can summon suns/?</span><br />
[09:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit, it isn't summoning suns...</span><br />

[09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( fklidhgzkigab THATS WHY ))</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it isn't summoning suns exactly.</span><br />

[09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its more like... causing the reaction to /form/ a sun...</span><br />
[09:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been doing it by polymorphing tiny ammounts of antimatter...</span><br />

[09:10] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I'm Patrick. Hier of Hope.</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and all this ability really does is just change night to day somehow, and light dark areas.</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, come on. All reds learn to summon suns /eventually/, it's part of our training.</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Reds?</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah. Red mages? I was in training to be one. Long time ago.</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm sorry, I used sun as a comparison.</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: really, a sun is much larger than that...</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: oh cool</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's okay, I'll start with a mini sun! I'm not picky.</span><br />

[09:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I'm going to go kill a thing dead</span><br />

[09:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Is that okay?</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I guess I could look into summoning demons.</span><br />

[09:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's plasma again?</span><br />

[09:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has followed, watching eagerly*</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can any of you create fire?</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to be using a lightning spell...</span><br />

[09:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is holding it in the palm of her hand* Not at all.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, put it in the middle of the ring.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, you do it then.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *sets the flame down carefully* Told you I was red.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  watches --</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and if you are wearing anything metal, please keep it away from the device...</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  BACKS UP BY A LOT --</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... magnetic metal.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright...</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  puts away his reflector just in case --</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay cool.</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  is wearing like pure Catonium Cat Armour, and pure Catonium is very magnitic --</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: What is the menium safe destence?</span><br />
[09:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  focuses on the flame... and suddenly it explodes into a sphere of a blazing gas that almost looks like a liquid due to the way it flows... --</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and there you have it.</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: O_O</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Holy fuck/!</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Teach me how!</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its not going to last long, so just... look at it.</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, if you put lightning through flame, you get that...</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What, really?</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow...</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … /how do I make lightning/.</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plasma is ionized gas... I can teach you to make that...</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yes good.</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but... nuclear fusion and fission... no.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: now, plasma can be contained with magnetic fields, like the one this ring is making... if I were to turn it off...</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stands the fuck back... --</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, it would expand rapidly.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I won't.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … so will you teach me how to make magic liquid fire and suns?</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... thats kinda the outside part of a sun...</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can teach you that... but the heart of a sun... thats too dangerous.</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't be silly, it's one of the last things a red mage learns.</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like black mages don't get to use the dimension circles proper.</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and does a red mage learn to know when to /stop/ before that?</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey! Discipline is a very important part of mage training!</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Burn one person you loved to a charred, smoking corpse, and you're pretty much guaranteed to never do it again!</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and what if you accidently burn a city?</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: a /planet/?</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, don't worry. Usually we have our powers under control by the time we're like, nine.</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: yeah im just going to keep backing up</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not a red mage... I don't know how you were taught this.</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: infact, I would say this would be a rather different method than what a red mage would use...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I knew anything at all...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just seems...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this isn't just normal fire manipulation...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this leads further on a cosmic scale...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Well, I woke up one day with my bed on fire, and then Father apprenticed me to Master Oshin. It's about that simple.</span><br />
[09:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … how the cosmic whatsit, though?</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, there are 3 states of matter.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, there is a fourth.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /Plasma/</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is like... an ionized gas.</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: everything in the universe is made out of... little circles.</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, if I ran an electrical charge through water, a liquid, I could seperate it into two gasses...</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: circles? huh... interesting...</span><br />
[09:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, these circles bind together to make the objects we know.</span><br />
[09:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plasma is when you bounce even tinyer circles off and onto those circles.</span><br />
[09:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its an Ionized gas...</span><br />
[09:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where electricity is flowing through it... however, heat is also required...</span><br />
[09:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: otherwise, the circles can't move fast enough to become like that.</span><br />
[09:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: these circles are made up of even tiner circles, which move so fast they basically are everywhere around that circle...</span><br />
[09:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and those tiny tiny circles... are made up of tiny tiny tiny /tiny/ so tiny you couldn't even imagine, strings.</span><br />
[09:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that are literally the thinest thing possible...</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they are one dimentional... and yet, go into 11 different dimentions...</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which ones?</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, you could say this sphere right here is three dimentional...</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  points at the plasma ball --</span><br />
[09:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and text on a piece of paper would be two...</span><br />
[09:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: those are /spacial/ dimentions... not alternate universes like you know of.</span><br />
[09:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh.</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: strings would be like a straight line... with only length, no width or height...</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at such a small level... things get... weird.</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how do you get... eight more, though?</span><br />
[09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...imagine branching a line off of a straight line... turning one dimention into two... then branching off of the paper into the air to make three...</span><br />
[09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: going further would be branching past the spacetime we exist in...</span><br />
[09:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the /way/ those dimentions are also control the laws of physics and the conditions in universes...</span><br />

[09:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you can literally create energy out of nothing with magic...</span><br />
[09:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: something that most people would say is impossible.</span><br />
[09:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I wish I could Magics</span><br />
