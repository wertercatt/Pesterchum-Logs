[06:35:19] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: Hello SV, I knew we would meet again evenatually.</span><br />
[06:35:35] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: *Eventually</span><br />
[06:35:48] <span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ...?</span><br />
[06:35:48] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Oh, you actually made it into the session?</span><br />
[06:35:53] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: I had thought you'd be dead at this point.</span><br />
[06:36:00] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Let me guess, temporal delay?</span><br />
[06:36:49] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: Indeed. I was dead not too long ago, if it is any consolation, and My Realself had been dead for quite some time prior to this point. Hence the delay.</span><br />
[06:37:23] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Oh? Godtier already?</span><br />
[06:37:31] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: How doesn't that surprise me.</span><br />
[06:39:21] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: It did not surprise me either. The Crypt Quest-Beds seem to have no "level restriction". I was, however, trapped in the core of derse with nothing but the whisperings to guide me for quite some time, however.</span><br />
[06:40:01] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Well, it's good to see that you're here.</span><br />
[06:40:06] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Atleast in one piece.</span><br />
[06:40:15] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Well, a godtier.. piece.</span><br />
[06:40:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm confused</span><br />
[06:40:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: who is QX?</span><br />
[06:40:33] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: She's an old friend of mine.</span><br />
[06:40:36] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Guildmate from Gw2.</span><br />
[06:40:51] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: I suppose it is fitting for a Seer of Void to have not sights to see, but rather, voices. Indeed, SV is correct.</span><br />
[06:41:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: woo!</span><br />
[06:41:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I might find Sam in the session yet!</span><br />
[06:44:27] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: I've recently rejoined my land but all seems to have gone to the Mists in my abscence, pardon my reference. My denizen seems to have hidden the planet itself from the rest of the session--besides myself, of course. It appears, however, that I may use some trickery to bypass this yet.</span><br />
[06:44:59] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: What a shame indeed.</span><br />
[06:47:04] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: So far I have only managed to bypass one of her cryptic puzzles. This will let one other person see it and reach it via Gate Bypass--My second gate leads straight back to my house, you see.</span><br />
[06:47:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: uh....</span><br />
[06:47:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats gonna be tough</span><br />
[06:47:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Chronos blew up all the gates</span><br />
[06:47:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all of them</span><br />
[06:48:02] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: Hm. My planet seems unaffected by this. How curious.</span><br />
[06:48:17] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: Perhaps that was the will of Nyx all along?</span><br />
[06:48:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...hiding your land's gates from the code?</span><br />
[06:49:55] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: ((Wait. Retcon that Nyx to Anubis.))</span><br />
[06:50:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( okay ))</span><br />
[06:52:57] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: So. I can still allow one person to breach my proverbial shroud. SV, do you mind helping me with the second lock? This will unlock the planet to be visible to everyone benevolent in the session, and I do not plan on opening the third lock unless absolutely nessecery.</span><br />
[06:53:16] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Sure.</span><br />
[06:53:22] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Can you send me the coordinates?</span><br />
[06:54:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what happens if someone good turns to the dark side?</span><br />
[06:54:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT quakingXenotype <span style="color:#233264">[CQX]</span>  || Coordinates sent! || --</span><br />
[06:54:45] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: Received, I'll be there in a few.</span><br />
[06:55:11] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: If someone beneolent should fall the planet will be obscurified once again until they change their mind about the whole evil schtick.</span><br />
[06:55:43] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: At least, that is as far as my ability to know about secrets can tell me on that nuance.</span><br />
[06:56:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
[06:57:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would suck if this turns out to be like peter pettigrew being a secret keeper</span><br />
[07:10:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...did anyone get that?</span><br />
[07:10:54] <span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ...after a quick google search, yes.</span><br />
[07:11:03] <span style="color:#233264">CQX: I got it, just busy with SV at the moment. I apologize profusely but we will be in no position to talk for the next half-hour or so.</span><br />
[07:11:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, understood</span><br />
[07:11:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: good luck</span><br />
[07:12:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll try to keep kimura away from the dice, he tends to be a luck magnet.</span><br />
[08:04:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also I think that the chain got broken by people being deleted, so we need to fix that</span><br />
[08:04:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ACK ))</span><br />
