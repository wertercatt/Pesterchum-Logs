<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i had a hell of a day today</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Really? that sucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i had some quite tight schedules i had to abide to</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: get on the bus, get off the bus, go three mutually distant places in under an hour and a half so you can get on the same bus again, get home (with only 4 hrs of sleep last night), crash into bed</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: now i have to go buy stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: yikes. </span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: and thereafter start studying japness gramurz</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: at least i managed to secure myself my kenkyusha japanese&gt;eng dict. today</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: now i only have to wait for it to arrive</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: some time in the second half of august</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: For college?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: well, it's called a faculty over here</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: and facs are all parts of a university</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it's a different system to the us one</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it's not too different, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: some things just have different names and the unis are generally more severely underfinanced, but other than that there's not much difference</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what about tuition? are they raising it something uncannybrutal like they are here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FUCK THE HIGH RATES OF TUITION.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: well, the minister of education (who's held that position for 8 years already, and seems like he'll be holding it for a long time still), who is the head of a private university known for being a diploma mill for kids of rich politicians and gray-area "businessmen", has been giving the university of belgrade hell for years already</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: tuition is just one of the ways pressure is put on the uni, and it shows</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: there's also the reduction of the number or exam periods from 6 to 5 (down to 4 next year, will probably be only an unreasonable 2 by 2016)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: mine seems to be wasting it's money on 'renovation'. you already renovated the dining area last year, why the hell are you rebuilding it again!?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: not to mention that the government treats its own uni like trash, bar the faculty of economy and the faculty of legal and political sciences (law school or smth)</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: which are especially privileged</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I used to be an accounting major, but switched to english- the changes are... interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: the cunt of a "minister" (a deposed dictator's cronie who survived in political life by snitching off all of his co-cronies and sucking up to the new ruling parites) openly called the faculties of philology and philosophy "unimportant"</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: YES WE'RE REALLY UNIMPORTANT</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  facepalms --</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: NO HUMANITIES GRADS TO BE TEACHERS AND NO PHILOLOGISTS TO TRANSLATE FOR THE SAKE OF MAINTAINING FOREIGN RELATIONS</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: YES I CAN SEE /ALL THE LOGIC/ IN THAT ONE</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: There is a simple solution. Sack the bastard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: AHAHAAHAHA he's sucked up to so many people that he'll only lose the position when he dies</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT anomalousEntity <span style="color:#3a4961">[CAE]</span>  prays to amaterasu and the japanese gods of war that the yakuza off the bastard --</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: but yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he's probably gonna get sacked</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: prime minister said something about voluntary resignations today on the national radio</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: No, I meant shove him into a sack and carry him away so he no longer bothers anyone. *joking*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (so many lols at the way you worded that side comment)</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i'd shove him in a sack and toss him into the danube</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF: pulling a Dishonored nonlethal run?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: let him float all the way down to the black sea</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: heh. thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: ok gotta go now</span><br />
