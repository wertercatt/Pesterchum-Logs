[07:26:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Though, this does spark an interesting dilemma.</span><br />
[07:26:53] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Am I a part of your session's code?</span><br />
[07:27:24] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: I would think so...</span><br />

[07:32:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He said there were a bunch of sessions. I have vague memories of going on after the Scratch to play a different session, with a different group of people...</span><br />
[07:32:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like, a branch-off. I have no idea how /entire sessions/ really branch out, but...</span><br />
[07:32:54] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Anyway.</span><br />
[07:33:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I assume that comment was ment as a question, but I'm not sure.</span><br />
[07:33:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yes it was a question.</span><br />
[07:33:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...You wouldn't accept returning back to life as usual?</span><br />
[07:33:30] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Alright, then here is my answer.</span><br />
[07:33:32] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: No.</span><br />
[07:33:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like everyone else?</span><br />

[07:34:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...It wasn't dying.</span><br />
[07:34:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It was a chance at normalcy.</span><br />

[07:36:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I realized halfway through that the only choice would be Scratching.</span><br />
[07:36:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't remember shit but HEEEEY maybe I just never joined. Or maybe I'm not a universal constant.</span><br />

[07:37:30] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How killing his universe before it had a chance to become, well, his universe, would do anything but dump us on a one-way track to doomed timeline.</span><br />

[07:46:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I disconnected DT after he went behind my back and tryed to prevent Ash from talking to me, he took it the wrong way, used the backup power supply he installed into himself, and flew off with two drones.</span><br />
[07:47:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The drone he transfered into took the brain scan I just made to check DT with, discovering that he was based on a period of time when my dreamself was still alive, alchemized a copy of Revelation 4.13, and flew into the jamming field.</span><br />

[07:48:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The other drone was remote controlled to make the satelite that makes the jamming field, and send it back in time using the sendificators in the veil.</span><br />
[07:49:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And he has adapted his code to be running around a picture of a certain shipping wall.</span><br />
[07:49:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, he is having code pointers point at code pointers IN THE image.</span><br />

[07:51:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Best case scenario, it wipes out all the computers in the session and we can alchemize more.</span><br />
[07:51:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Worse case, it gets into the fundamental code of the session.</span><br />

[07:56:39] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: But considering that I don't know the location of said AI, it would be very difficult, and would take /way/ too much time.</span><br />
[07:56:52] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Other AI's could help, but still.</span><br />
[07:57:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...basically, if DT activates Revelation, and it gets into Sburb's source code, THIS ENTIRE MOTHERBARKING SESSION WILL SELF-DESTRUCT.</span><br />

[07:59:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh right, explaining /that/. in Uplink, Revelation is a virus that is meant to destroy the internet by infecting computers and, well, making them self-aware and then self-destruct.</span><br />
[07:59:14] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Can't we have one day without shinaigains?</span><br />
