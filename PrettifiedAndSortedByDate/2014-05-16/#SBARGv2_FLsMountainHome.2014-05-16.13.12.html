[01:16] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads back outside, unshrinking once he's far enough away to not be spotted by any snake guards --</span><br />

[01:32] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  is inside one of his labs, placing the finishing touches on a robot, installing what seems to be a housing. --</span><br />
[01:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // There are a few other humanoid robots around the lab, all over the place, mostly unfinished... --</span><br />
[01:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  slowly moves a jar torwards the housing, orange flame inside of it... --</span><br />
[01:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  coaxes the flame inside of the robot, closing the hatch and flipping a switch. --</span><br />
[01:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // The eyes light up, and the robot jumps back. --</span><br />

[01:36] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  is interupted by the robot lifting an arm up, a spear appearing in it, and energy building up. --</span><br />

[01:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // Lightning strikes the mountain, blowing apart the upper floors, before a second bolt seems to shoot up /into/ the sky. --</span><br />
[01:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  is left in the destroyed lab, heavily breathing, robotic limbs all over the place --</span><br />

[01:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  hears the explosions from the town and looks back toward the mountain --</span><br />
[01:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what the fuck.</span><br />
[01:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // The entire peak of the mountain has been blown clear off, smoke rising into the air. --</span><br />
[01:42] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts flying mountain-ward, hoping him stealing those games and movies didn't cause that --</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  is in the middle of the room, kneeling down on the floor in pain, blood and robotic corpses all over the place. --</span><br />
[01:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gets there, and promptly starts medigunning FL --</span><br />
[01:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what the hell happeneed here?</span><br />
[01:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I was finishing up the soul bot for Sam... and he just... I don't even know!</span><br />
[01:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp.</span><br />
[01:47] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks around, trying to find a direction of the trail of destruction --</span><br />
[01:47] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Why did I put the sylladex in the robot?</span><br />
[01:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you did what.</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, its his soul, so I figured it would be best if he had his stuff... oh god...</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  facepaws --</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // The clouds seem to be sparking... black. That is totally not normal behavior for storm clouds --</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...shit.</span><br />
[01:50] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stares at the clouds, and instinctively uses Galestorm, trying to fix the problem the same way Kusa Village was solved --</span><br />
[01:50] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  spots a small body across the room, and blinks. --</span><br />
[01:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Oh no.</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // The clouds seem to be blown away, before being pulled back. However, you do see a dark castle in the clouds for the short period of time when they are away. --</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what.</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  looks up into the clouds, and blasts off into the sky. --</span><br />
[01:52] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  flies off after him --</span><br />
[01:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  raises a sword, and gets blown back when a black bolt hits it, causing a cascade of energy within the sword... which has blown off in the other direction --</span><br />
[01:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh crap. Zap Tap, don't fail me now.</span><br />
[01:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues flying forward, hoping FL can catch up somehow --</span><br />
[01:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  manages to catch himself in the air, before pulling out his shield and charging forwards --</span><br />
[01:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // Kimura, black bolts are arcing torwards you. --</span><br />
[01:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  attempts to redirect it with the brush --</span><br />
[01:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // The black bolts seem to vanish completely when the astral brush makes contact with them. --</span><br />
[01:59] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues doing that to block more attacks, and continues flying --</span><br />
[01:59] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  meanwhile is absorbing the bolts into his shield, which seems to be working... --</span><br />
[02:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // Now question is, how are you going to get past the layer of clouds? --</span><br />
[02:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws more Windy Thing, naturally :P ...and then uses Veil of Mist to nyoom through the gap while it's open --</span><br />
[02:03] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  proceeds to ram into the clouds, going right through them. --</span><br />
[02:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // You arrive into the middle of the storm, black castle dead ahead. --</span><br />
[02:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hopy crap... how did this get here?</span><br />
[02:06] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks for an obvious landing platform, and lands if there is one --</span><br />
[02:06] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  // There is a dark wind blowing out of the castle... This might be your last chance to save your ga- er, call for backup. --</span><br />
[02:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  wonders where the heck everyone else has been lately --</span><br />
[02:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  lands on a platform, which moves slightly upon contact... it seems to be a solid form of the clouds. --</span><br />
[02:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  seems to be taking this breather to check his inventory. --</span><br />
[02:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp. now what?</span><br />
[02:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  deploys twelve focus ribbons on himself, sighing, before pulling out his ruby necklace and the HP Regen Badge Kimura had given him. --</span><br />
[02:11] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...So, do /you/ have a plan?</span><br />
[02:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope.</span><br />
[02:11] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...great.</span><br />
[02:12] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  switches modes on his shades, scanning the entrance of the castle. --</span><br />
[02:13] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Alright, high levels of magical flux within...</span><br />
[02:13] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Along with... nonstandard geometry.</span><br />
[02:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh boy, we're going non-euclidean here?</span><br />
[02:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[02:15] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Chances are that we won't be able to teleport out.</span><br />
[02:15] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So we should be ready before we go in.</span><br />
[02:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno, I have two forms of portal creation so at least one of them should be functional.</span><br />
[02:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...but seriously, where /is/ everyone?</span><br />
[02:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Or one of them might end up creating a gigantic rift while in there.</span><br />
[02:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I don't know.</span><br />
[02:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I'm afraid it might just be the two of us.</span><br />
[02:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...crud, good point. don't want to Infinite Data Else-If Loop this close to the town.</span><br />
[02:18] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[02:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, let's do this I guess.</span><br />
[02:19] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  sighs, and checks something on his shades one more time. --</span><br />
[02:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Dammit, the memo isn't even up... either that, or the connection is already wonky...</span><br />
[02:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah, it wasn't up this morning either.</span><br />
[02:21] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...That is rather disheartening.</span><br />
[02:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........I hope an AK-Class Scenario hasn't happened :/</span><br />
[02:21] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Well, I'm going in.</span><br />
[02:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, here we go...</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  runs torwards the entrance, and promptly vanishes into the castle. --</span><br />
