[08:01:01] <span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: :-) </span><br />
[08:08:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Athena, have you heard about the tale of Pandora's Box?</span><br />
[08:09:17] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, of course. 'Tis a classic legend.</span><br />
[08:09:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It sure says alot about human curiosity, doesn't it?</span><br />
[08:10:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The gods give this woman a box, and tell her not to look inside</span><br />
[08:10:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, /of course/ she is going to look inside.</span><br />
[08:10:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … FL I think we all know how the story goes.</span><br />
[08:10:29] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Mhm</span><br />
[08:11:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, this is also related to the event of Prometheus stealing fire, knowledge, in this case, from the gods, and giving it to humanity.</span><br />
[08:12:28] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed. The classic old plot point of "'Don't do the thing' 'Well now I have to do the thing.'" </span><br />
[08:13:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Interesting how you would /also/ pose that as option a.</span><br />
[08:14:09] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: It's not rare for people to put their personal favored option ahead of the other, player.</span><br />
[08:14:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
[08:15:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yet, it is also rather interesting that Hannah goes missing /right before/ this meeting.</span><br />
[08:15:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would you agree with me on that?</span><br />
[08:15:24] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hm... Indeed. Good eye, there.</span><br />
[08:15:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To be fair, I'm not sure if I can trust you. However, that is not my decision to make.</span><br />
[08:15:56] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:17:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It seems that the majority has been leaning torward option a.</span><br />
[08:17:09] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Its a group decision, kid. You all are supposed to choose between one or the other, together. That being said, I know you all are just doing something stupid instead.</span><br />
[08:17:40] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like what, AH?</span><br />
[08:18:41] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: What do you mean, "Like what?" I have heard on multiple occassions that stupidity is something I can expect often here.</span><br />
[08:18:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
[08:19:48] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>Sadly True.</span><br />

[08:22:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, but see, how would I know what question would be the wrong one? After all, our beliefs might be as simple as a difference in usage between operating systems, either closed or open source.</span><br />

[08:24:07] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Don't worry about questions, player. I don't attack a person because they asked a simple question; that would go against most of my beleifs. I just won't answer a question I deem unfit.</span><br />
