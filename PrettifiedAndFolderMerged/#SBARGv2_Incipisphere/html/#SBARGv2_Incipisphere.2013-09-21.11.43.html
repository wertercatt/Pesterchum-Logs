[12:03:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: now I just need to wait ten minutes to get back up to full</span><br />
[12:03:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what?</span><br />
[12:03:21] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: Problay a lot of features are broken on that</span><br />
[12:03:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like a teleport that doesn't cause me to vomit?</span><br />
[12:03:42] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: It is the first new card, im having you be the BETA TESTER</span><br />
[12:03:58] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: Tell me what doesnt work, and ill get on it</span><br />
[12:04:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
[12:04:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: teleportation that doesn't cause me to vomit</span><br />
[12:04:25] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: working on removing teleporting sickness</span><br />
[12:04:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thank /god/</span><br />
[12:04:59] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: I do think it will take up the ENTIRE card charge everytime used</span><br />
[12:05:45] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: so il have the lowpowercost teleport with sickness, for people who want to conserve power</span><br />
[12:06:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
[12:06:29] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: working on cards now</span><br />
[12:06:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at least its better than teleporting when the network is down</span><br />
[12:07:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even /know/ how that worked</span><br />
[12:07:19] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: yeah, I put in a "WARNING NETWORK DOWN, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO PROCCED?" if the network is down</span><br />
[12:07:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the power of Weird Plot Shit probably</span><br />
[12:07:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, how do you recharge the card? does it do it over time, or is it a usb cable?</span><br />
[12:08:02] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: And the reason it works, is because the Cards can teleport on their own, but the network is the switch box, taking you where you want to go</span><br />
[12:08:12] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: instead of somewhere really random</span><br />
[12:08:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like the veil with /1hp/</span><br />
[12:08:30] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: yep</span><br />
[12:08:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and a burnt focus ribbon</span><br />
[12:08:38] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: Yep</span><br />
[12:08:50] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: okay cataloging features now</span><br />
[12:08:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ouch. so that's what happened the other day.</span><br />
[12:10:32] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: Kimura, the cards have only a cerian amount of memory like smart phones. and they can either be charged by spending boondollars, going to charging stations, or obtaining grist</span><br />
[12:10:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. that works too.</span><br />
[12:10:54] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: So the features are like apps, you can only have as many as you have space</span><br />
[12:11:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so anyway, anything planned for today?</span><br />
[12:11:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no idea ➜</span><br />
[12:11:40] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: Ive set up charging stations at the <span style="color:#bacafe"> Bacafe </span> and LoCaL</span><br />
[12:13:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say you should just use a touch screen</span><br />
[12:13:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: instead of buttons</span><br />
[12:13:44] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: yes</span><br />
[12:13:48] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: that is in the plans</span><br />
[12:13:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like on the food replicator</span><br />
[12:14:03] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: the buttons wont work with the feature thing soon</span><br />
[12:14:11] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: workingworkingworking</span><br />
[12:15:25] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: okay im going to get going on work</span><br />
