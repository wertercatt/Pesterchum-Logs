<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nah man. i /have/ chainsaws.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: NV, he's talking about the thing to be able to allocate with ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i need a chainsawKind</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: OH.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the strife card</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let me check uuuh let's see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I had a blank one a while ago... can't remember what happened to it, but I know I didn't use it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I actually think I got one from a dungeon WAAAY back I never used.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Want it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mind if i yoink it from you for the next forever?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I don't care I've still got 3 more open.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And with that god tier ability strife kinds are already really outdated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i haven't tiered yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, I know, which is why you need this waaay more than me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: shank you very much sire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, considering how fucking rich we all got from CS economy-wrecking, 12.24 megagrist of every type would be feasible... /with the exception of motherbarking Zillium/, which I'm not sure if it's even available in stock exchanges!</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'll stick to just using this shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: PK: SE needed an unallocated strife card, I was mentioning that they can be alchemized but cost an unreasonable amount of EVERY type of grist...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and then he mentioned that we are all unreasonably rich</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i'm fine playing it old-fashioned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CPK: not me really</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CPK: CaFaI expended fucktons of my grist on LoCaL's "improvements"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, even without grist hoards (which we can't touch anyway), we could definitely afford to alchemize blank strife cards... except for fucking zillium which can't be bought at stock exchanges</span><br />

<span style="color:#55007f">CPK: or killing zillyhoo imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically,it involves trickster shenanigans. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: FS </span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a675">CFF: No, Seriosuly. FS just kicked his ass just using these thingies: ()</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But uh, it wasn't really...an accomplishment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It was...how do I put this. Probably more physical painful to watch than it actually was for Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … he got beaten up by a pair of parentheses.</span><br />
