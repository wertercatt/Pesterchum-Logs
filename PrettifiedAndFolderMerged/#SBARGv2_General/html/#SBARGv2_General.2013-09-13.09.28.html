<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, still not sure if I want to join or not either...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: maybe I'll just stick with sbarg and the hotel :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how hard would it be to join later, like after today's proof-of-concept run?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and honestly, I thought the cyberpunk rp would have happened once sbarg was already over :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug. maaaaybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But it's kinda tough doing three roleplays  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and I'd rather not give up either of the ones I'm already doing :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus, wasn't it starting /after/ v2?</span><br />

<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: heh, that's okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: my main question is, at what point does late-joining become mega-hard like it did for Incipi after the EOA2 update?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah. That's a good question. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: right now we just started</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Because I have no idea when sbargv2 will end, but I'd rather wait for it to end before I get to a new one. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: and had the first meeting; i'm not really sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It could take a whole six more months before v2 ends, but I don't want to be involved in too many things. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Hard to split dedications. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And then I'd get bored of one :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and I'd rather not do that :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. I've already dropped my japanese studies to Legendary Infinite Hiatus status because v2 takes so much of my time, so I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: like i said, you're free to hop in when you can, i'm not going to push you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: what are you talking about?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, sorry to repeat myself. I do hope to join, as I am interested, I'd just rather not have to divide my time. Sbarg can already be stressful enough sometimes and I've got irl, irc, and skype chats, not sure how much more I can handle before I go insane. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, CS :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But their first album had some of the most depressing stuff out there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Their two hits "Hey Jealousy" and "Until I fall Away" were both hits, but the lyrics themselves were like /wow/ :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I feel bad for this guy :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, and their other hit :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: "Found out about you" :&gt;</span><br />
