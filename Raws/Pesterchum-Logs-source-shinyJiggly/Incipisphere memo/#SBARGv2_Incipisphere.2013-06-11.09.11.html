<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((mmk))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, with how many Keter Tier bugs there are, Torigami has to prioritize them above non-reality-threatening bugs like the lack of gettable tigers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ And the lack of Skaia /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there isn't a lack of Skaia. the clouds are just accessing VERY WRONG data.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a few weeks ago (maybe it was a month), I had to go to the Battlefield for something. don't remember what, but as long as you avert your eyes from the memetic-hazardy clouds, you're relatively safe</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Also prudent to watch out for that whole "Ongoing War" thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, that too. what I mean is, as long as you don't look at the clouds, it's as safe as a non-glitched Battlefield.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Rob, we can hear you all the way from the Bacafe.</span><br />
