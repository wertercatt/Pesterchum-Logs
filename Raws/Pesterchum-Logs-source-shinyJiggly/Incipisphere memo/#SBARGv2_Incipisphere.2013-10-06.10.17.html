<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Honestly, how are /we/ going to stop him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it would be better to throw him into an exploding dream bubble.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: seeing as he didn't even tell us about our origins ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so plan B is to delete chronos code by throwing him into the blue hole or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and the second (with the exploding-dreambubble thing) is that I read a thing somewhere that said popping the bubble killed the ghosts only because they CAN'T exist outside the bubbles. those that are still alive and physical in the bubble wouldn't die from it popping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember that the horror terrors were hurt by the explosion.</span><br />
