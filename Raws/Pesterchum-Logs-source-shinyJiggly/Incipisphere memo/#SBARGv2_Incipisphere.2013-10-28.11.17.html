<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, rigid pokemon typing is confusing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not really, I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On another note, I taught my Delphox in Y Power Up Punch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Miaow, I think I'd be x0 with Fire, Thunder; x1/2 with Dark, Ghost; x4 with Psychic… And I don't know what has that. Hrm. Raz, what're you? :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I was /sick/ of Dark types kicking my ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only way you would take 4x damage from Psychic is if you were a Fighting/Poison type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: didn't we have a discussion like this a few months ago? I know we found out that most aspects don't line up with a type very well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but we aren't matching up aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Except for mine. I'm pretty much pure Flying, aren't I? Heh heh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we are matching up /people/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I haven't played enough against those other move-types to know if I'm weak against any of them but Mind powers/games are hella scary so.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: shit gtg afk</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might wanna click show all types</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: See ya!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normal/Ghost type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we can agree on one thing though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit has Wonder Guard.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, I could be a jerk and say V-Create or Guillotine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But really, Acid Armor is awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either that or Teleport.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except I hate teleporting myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It makes me nauseous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: point that out to them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mega Charizard X has a better design.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also its a dragon <span style="color:#ff0000">♥</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Meeeeh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I guess it is better for Physical Attacks too...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is it an action replay</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually that could make sense. considering how random her land is, the ultimate treasure might be an action replay set to inject random "cheats" (read: junk data) on a regular basis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it was random, we would all be dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More like /importing/ data.</span><br />
