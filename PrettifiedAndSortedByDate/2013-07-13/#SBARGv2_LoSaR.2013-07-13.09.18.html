<div class=memolog>
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 LOSAR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT blackoutCapitalist [CBC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  is in the picture, he stands on a main street. It looks like the main street of new york but a ruined variant, it is dark. A clouded sky covers the land. He stands there, a rumbling is heard in the distance. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  looks ahead, you zoom in as you stare at him overhead trough the viewport. You now notice that his hands are on fire, the skin burning and the area around it charred from previous use. A horde of imps and ogres tramples in his direction. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  holds out his hands, and moves them in a breath casting motion a swath of fire whips around him. And we're talking the huge kind, as the horde closes in he throws the tidal wave of fire over the horde. The mob disperses and runs around on fire, eventually burning down and turning into grist. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  collects the grist, the huge concrete ruins around him burn from the swath but soon fade out. Concrete doesn't burn that well. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CBC: (( I was sketching his godtier, have a look. <a href='https://join.me/724-822-983'>https://join.me/724-822-983</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist's <span style="color:#000000">[CBC'S]</span>  fire in his hands burns out, what is left is a red hot glow of fire on his hands. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  checks the memo, looking at a small robot floating by him holding a monitor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  walks on, down the street. An occasional small hint of flame burns out of his hands. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  turns a corner and suddenly faces a wooden giclopse. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  jumps back, a gust of wind is drawn from the immediate area of the giclopse. You see that it is trying to move but no longer can. He holds two orbs of fast moving air in his hands. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  snaps his fingers, the wind ignites and he chucks the fireblasts back at the giclopse. It is ignited on hit and falls over by the sheer force of the windy-fiery attack. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  smiles as he looks up, the giclopse burning out. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT blackoutCapitalist <span style="color:#000000">[CBC]</span>  closes the viewport. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CBC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
