<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  was far too close to dodge, and takes the swing head-on, falling back a bit. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  is there anything special about the epee that I should know about? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  Not this one, so. Just a metal sword with a very sharp point. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings at the epee --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  was not expecting that bit, and the epee goes flying. Stupid swords are so dang light... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  as soon as AC would try and move any closer as to lift EQ, they would get a sparp electrical pain up their arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  but weren't you holding me --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  yeah. Electrical pain up the arm  if you moved, basically. Already so close, after all. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: if you aren't carefully I might go full on elderitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You are just like the other monsters I fight on a daily basis, now. Nothing more. Worse, in fact. The monsters at least know when to quit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  uncaptha's a blue potion and downs it, then facing AC. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  bows to AC, and rushes over, this time attacking with the point of the sword. To the neck. No fooling around now. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  shit, keep forgetting its not a real sword... facepalm --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes the hit, knocking her back once again. She almost instantly gets back on her feet to attack, though. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  hesitates for a bit... then lets go of the weapon, and tries to slip away from AC. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  loses grip --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  pulls the epee out of arm --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes a few steps away, and talks into her watch. "Please put athens under lockdown. Athena was right, apparently. Quite right. I'll try and head over shortly..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I'm done with this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... I ask, if you were to leave now... would you still head back to the innocent little party and cause bloodshed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Or are you done?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Especially when a simple hit would have been so much easier</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: and less violent</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I don't care. I'd rather be killed than let others suffer over anothers stupidity. I hate stupidity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 's why I hate this session, really. It's why I hate creatures like you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: what do you think I planned on doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  grins --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: in reality all I would have done was bobbed him upside the head and have been done with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: the only reason i'm fighting with you is because you yourself are being stupid and overreacting</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: It's a nonlethal weapon when I want it to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I can cause as much pain as my hits would allow and it would do nothing more than sting for a bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Up till now i've been using it non-lethaly </span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I somehow doubt that. I simply wouldnt let my friend be hurt, and it lead to this. If I actually let you be lethal out in the world, especially so close to the end... No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: you should stop and let me hit him and be done with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: wouldn't that be simpler?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: a single hit was all i'd do</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Violence solves nothing, in this case. You would still be a monster with such a short fuse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: i'd have no part of wounded or killing another player</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  looks around, seemingly bored --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: this bat is nothing more than a healing shiv as it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could hit him as much as I wanted and it would do nothing more than sting for a second</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You saaaaay so much, and yet here we are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: your reaction is stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You have such a short fuse and have learned nothing. I have at least learned that Athena was right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  smiles, and wardrobifies into her Normal Witch of Mind outfit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Does it honestly matter to you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'd think not.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: are you really planning to kill me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: It was nothing more than a pety grudge and you'd bring it to this</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I don't need mercy.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Now.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: you've already tried my patience long enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Ironic that you brought me here and now your getting mad at me to leave...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  clances over to the webcams. "I mean you as well." --</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: but I have no intention of killing you or fighting back any longer</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: wouldn't it be ironic... if YOU were to cause their destructions</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: if I continue fighting you, there's no telling what will happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could destroy your land</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could destroy my land</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could destroy the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could destroy your friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: and my friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: don't make me do that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Because after that i'd destroy myself...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: i'd destroy myself because I couldn't live with that pain</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Which is why in the long run you should be eradicated. Not by me, but by someone else. Destrucive powers like those have no place in a pantopia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I love everyone in this session</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: even if I haven't known them that long, I do care</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Then learn to be calm. Not everything needs a reaction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: that's where your wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: reaction is neccasary</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: retaliation is neccasary</span><br />
