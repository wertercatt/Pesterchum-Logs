[10:26:18] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: so there are these two girls and they live in this poor world where everything's old and broken down etc.</span><br />
[10:27:07] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and one night a... train? phone booth? idek comes and they get in it and they're transported into this high tech magic future place thing</span><br />
[10:27:29] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: they were very adamant about making it to the transporter thing on time</span><br />
[10:27:59] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: there's a bunch of other kids and stuff there as well, some giddy and knowing, some disoriented, and it's a night of fun.</span><br />

[10:29:18] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and then... it repeats.</span><br />
[10:29:33] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: sorry she was actually a middle child i believe</span><br />
[10:29:48] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: all three go in, and the cycle repeats, and then the older sister's back, but no little brother</span><br />
[10:29:56] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and it keeps /happening/</span><br />
[10:31:31] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: basically after the reveal, come night, time keeps rewinding back to when she had an older sister</span><br />
[10:31:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Whoa :&gt;</span><br />
[10:32:01] <span style="color:#4b1e4b">CSA: and the middle one gets desperate and starts asking the other kids, the few survivors who live through the cycles on repeat, what the shit is going on</span><br />
