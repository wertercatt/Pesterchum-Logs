<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Spires.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Land of Spires and Frogs... interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: They blocked the light and a lot of passages to some pretty nice places to get to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I had to break them it seems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I had some help. </span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh... Well then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But anyways, when the spires broke, they opened up really nice secret passages to wonderful meadows and cave lakes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: It was like little forests in caves and it was BEAUTIFUL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I enjoyed my time there.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: And i was all spooky and invisible on account of being some sort of weird ghost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: So i followed her a while and i guess i fooled myself into believing this could go well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Like being dead was a normal thing a kid does growing up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: But it didn't work and toni sort of got killed too.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Well, it was just multiple times in different places.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I drifted on skaia for a long while and saw a lot in the clouds.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, have you studied at least basic classpect theory? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Prince of Space?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the prince class, as you alredy know, is a destroyer class. And when paired with the aspect of space implies a focus on the active destruction of space, as well as actively destroying with space. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: This doesn't sound so good.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Do you hate frogs by any chance?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh yeah, Antimatter reactors!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, you could bring things closer together by destroying the space between them. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or you could crush an object enough to apply enough pressure to cause nuclear fusion in a fusion reactor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles... always with the antimatter... ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /one/ time too many.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: I got prince stuffed down my brain hole WAY too much.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2ed400">CJG: Why a bard?</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, space is also associated with creativity. ➜</span><br />
