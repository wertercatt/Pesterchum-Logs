[19:10:51] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And AA, could you make an item and leave it in the medium?</span><br />
[19:11:04] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Eh? Okay, what sort of item?</span><br />
[19:11:10] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Its... just a backup measure.</span><br />
[19:11:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk, but it's probably whatever Alpha Dave mass-produced to get his buhmillions...</span><br />
[19:11:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: as far as dense jpeg shit goes</span><br />
[19:11:41] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Okay, but what should I make? Just anything?</span><br />

[19:18:54] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: I made whatever I could, so I'm on the way.</span><br />
[19:19:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, when I left, I basically packed everything in my house, just shy of packing the dwelling spire itself...</span><br />
[19:19:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: If needed, it will be able to make defenses for gene, and can send items through the door incase of us running out of everything.</span><br />
[19:19:51] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Well, maybe not.</span><br />
[19:20:11] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I know that a consort can go through the door (not a fun thing to see in space nope nope nope)</span><br />
