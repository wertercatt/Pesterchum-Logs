[03:25:22] <span style="color:#722881">AS: bust?</span><br />
[03:25:24] <span style="color:#722881">AS: *busy</span><br />
[03:25:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...no, I just woke up.</span><br />
[03:26:20] <span style="color:#722881">AS: oh, damn, did I wake you?</span><br />
[03:26:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: No.</span><br />
[03:27:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Whats up?</span><br />
[03:27:15] <span style="color:#722881">AS: Oh ok. Um...How do those potions of ender shifting work? Like one time each, or back and forth?</span><br />
[03:27:26] <span style="color:#722881">AS: *gender</span><br />
[03:27:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Um, its kinda a limited amount of time.</span><br />
[03:28:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Now, I don't expect it to last a /week/, but um... yeah.</span><br />
[03:29:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It /normally/ lasts an hour.</span><br />
[03:31:04] <span style="color:#722881">AS: ...normally?</span><br />
[03:31:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: yeah uh, from what I remember.</span><br />
[03:31:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Might be able to extend the length.</span><br />
[03:34:47] <span style="color:#722881">AS: I'll let that be your experiment at that time</span><br />
[03:35:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: maybe by boiling it...</span><br />
[03:35:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: less water, and thus more concentrated?</span><br />
[03:36:06] <span style="color:#722881">AS: that actually sounds feasible</span><br />
[03:36:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Sorta wonder what kinda effect that would have on other potions... for science!</span><br />
[03:37:13] <span style="color:#722881">AS: hey now, don't get too crazy XD</span><br />
[03:37:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Like, what happens if you concentrate a potion that doesn't exactly work with duration?</span><br />
[03:38:25] <span style="color:#722881">AS: not sure</span><br />
[03:38:41] <span style="color:#722881">AS: it may just take less to work?</span><br />
[03:38:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Thats kinda what sort of things I would test.</span><br />
[03:39:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Maybe I could see if I could make potions from candies.</span><br />
[03:40:21] <span style="color:#722881">AS: potions from candies?</span><br />
[03:40:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: yeah</span><br />
[03:40:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: like that candy box 2 game</span><br />
[03:40:59] <span style="color:#722881">AS: i don't know that game</span><br />
[03:44:55] <span style="color:#722881">AS: ...i don't get the point of this game...</span><br />
[03:45:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: yeah its</span><br />
[03:45:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: interesting</span><br />
[03:45:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: to say the least</span><br />
[03:46:48] <span style="color:#722881">AS: what do you suppose the candies potions would do?</span><br />
[03:48:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Maybe one that restores health?</span><br />
[03:49:23] <span style="color:#722881">AS: a game about eating mass amounts of candy...would restore health?</span><br />
[03:49:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: it gets complicated later on</span><br />
[03:50:25] <span style="color:#722881">AS: oh yes...i see...just got the health bar</span><br />
[04:02:30] <span style="color:#722881">AS: oh..now there's killing things</span><br />
[04:07:34] <span style="color:#722881">AS: anyways, thanks, was just curious about the potion</span><br />
