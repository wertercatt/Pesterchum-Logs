[12:31:21] I have been playing pokemon for two hours<br />
[12:31:21] Hello everyone it is I NN notronble<br />
[12:31:24] So far<br />
[12:31:37] It has been a nuzlocke that I am cheating on<br />
[12:32:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda wanna play half nuzlockes</span><br />
[12:33:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where you can only catch the first pokemon you encounter in an area, but pokemon don't /die/</span><br />
[12:33:28] I am now bored with it<br />
[12:34:40] I'm basically doing that<br />
[12:34:40] Aside from HMs being a pain it's pretty fun<br />
[12:34:40] I'm not really hardcore enough for permanent death yet<br />
[12:35:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and perhaps one could do a flip of that</span><br />
[12:35:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: catch any pokemon you want, but perma death</span><br />
[12:37:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#410f41">CURRENT Nova [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:37:21] SA: yo i did the color test and it's actually<br />
[12:37:28] SA: kinda scary accurate<br />
[12:37:30] Oh that thing<br />
[12:37:32] I did it<br />
[12:37:33] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Horoscope logic</span><br />
[12:37:34] The issue is<br />
[12:37:42] It uses weasel words<br />
[12:37:45] SA: /kind of/.<br />
[12:37:46] If I was on a computer<br />
[12:37:57] I could do a sentence by sentence<br />
[12:38:14] Showing how 90% of it is intentionally almost always correct<br />
[12:38:21] I had one inaccurate one<br />
[12:38:33] It was correct in emotional and etc<br />
[12:39:26] Then it adds angst about being alone and having to take care of everyone acting like children<br />
[12:39:26] As my "main problem"<br />
[12:39:26] I don't have either<br />
[12:39:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#887000">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:39:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: need to take that</span><br />
[12:39:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: qui</span><br />
[12:39:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: z</span><br />
[12:40:15] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: well that second one...</span><br />
[12:40:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: wow yeah these results are vague as shit</span><br />
[12:41:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: "Only those closest to him know deep down he is sensitive and sentimental."</span><br />
[12:41:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well fuck everybody wants to believe that about themselves</span><br />
[12:41:27] My main problem isn't even possible to detect on the form<br />
[12:41:27] Because it assumes cis<br />
[12:41:27] :D<br />
[12:41:27] But yeah most of the color quiz stuff<br />
[12:41:27] It's like<br />
[12:41:27] You're emotional and romantic<br />
[12:41:27] Most people<br />
[12:41:27] Will agree<br />
[12:41:27] Because those things can be made to work with any self esteem<br />
[12:41:27] Hopelessly romantic and emotionally demanding<br />
[12:41:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: "Not a team player and is unwilling to be involved in most activities. In the past he was over involved and now emotionally drained. Due to his fear of over involvement, he now chooses to remain uninvolved with the activities around him."</span><br />
[12:41:55] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: hahaha what the fuck are you talking about</span><br />
[12:42:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: as soon as it stopped being vague as shit it went off the rails</span><br />
[12:42:23] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I think that one is mine SL...</span><br />
[12:42:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: eh</span><br />
[12:43:41] Or good at romance and goodly emotional<br />
[12:43:41] I literally did a sentence by sentence and most of the results were like that<br />
[12:43:41] This is the most hilarious result<br />
[12:43:41] "Takes pleasure in sexual acts"<br />
[12:43:41] WHO DOESN'T?<br />
[12:43:41] :/<br />
[12:43:41] But yeah I studied this stuff for fun<br />
[12:43:41] Lots of tests weasel word and rainbow statement<br />
[12:43:41] And appeal to emotion<br />
[12:43:42] They feel more accurate overall than the details are<br />
[12:44:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yep</span><br />
[12:44:47] It might be able to pick out small things<br />
[12:45:24] Like how DP got over reactivity and I got palemance being the only thing on my mind<br />
[12:45:24] But<br />
[12:45:24] It extrapolates from there based on what those usually mean<br />
[12:45:24] Overreactiviry usually means spoiled ness<br />
[12:45:24] (Which is accurate for dp tbh)<br />
[12:45:24] Romance usually means fear of being alone<br />
[12:45:32] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but when it tries it just ends up inaccurate as shit like above</span><br />
[12:46:17] (No I just have angst about body)<br />
[12:46:17] It depends<br />
[12:46:17] But yeah it's just rainbow statement ing, weasel wording, appealing to emotions, and extrapolating from the small bit it can pick up<br />
[12:46:28] Same as most<br />
[12:46:41] It just wraps it up in "professional" 90s style web design<br />
[12:46:52] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: """""professional"""""</span><br />
[12:47:08] There was this hilarious one<br />
[12:47:20] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: <a href='http://xkcd.com/605/'>http://xkcd.com/605/</a></span><br />
[12:47:22] It did the same schtick<br />
[12:48:13] But worse<br />
[12:48:34] It made you answer puzzles<br />
[12:48:34] And it acted all spooky and conspiracy and the making of page claimed it was some weird conspiracy sheet<br />
[12:48:34] And claimed it was all incredibly accurate<br />
[12:48:34] When really it just rainbow statements all around<br />
[12:48:49] People were sharing their results with the non accurate parts highlighted<br />
[12:49:02] And were like wow that is accurate<br />
[12:49:20] When 50% of it was in yellow for half right or red for wrong<br />
[12:49:33]  Lemme find a link<br />
[12:50:34] <a href='http://www.hypnoid.com/psytest2.html'>http://www.hypnoid.com/psytest2.html</a><br />
[12:51:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh god its michael gibson's psych test</span><br />
[12:51:17] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Oh, a beige page</span><br />
[12:51:21] Look at the story and read the blog posts<br />
[12:51:34] They're literally a shitty creepy pasta<br />
[12:51:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...what the fuck are these questions</span><br />
[12:51:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: "where is the sin"</span><br />
[12:51:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fuck you</span><br />
[12:51:57] That's the point<br />
[12:52:04] It's to look creepy<br />
[12:52:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE QUESTIONS</span><br />
[12:52:31] They're gibberish<br />
[12:52:39] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: holy shit this is incrediblle</span><br />
[12:52:41] They just seed a random number generator<br />
[12:53:02] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i am laughing</span><br />
[12:53:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: "how can you stop them lying about you"</span><br />
[12:53:49] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh my god</span><br />
[12:53:57] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: this is increible</span><br />
[12:53:58] That picks out a rainbow statement paragraph<br />
[12:53:58] Seriously though<br />
[12:53:58] Click the story of link<br />
[12:53:58] The backstory of it is basically<br />
[12:54:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: im doing it</span><br />
[12:54:35] German scientists doing weird refresh rate subliminal hypnosis (Hollywood style) asked for a flash version<br />
[12:54:35] How obviously fake<br />
[12:56:56] Is no one else laughing about the obviously fake blog backstory<br />
[12:57:04] Other than SL<br />
[12:57:15] Did I kill everyone with the stupid fairness<br />
[12:57:22] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: yea</span><br />
[12:58:01] I took the test for lulzies<br />
[12:58:07] and wow damn those questions.<br />
[12:58:29] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: The only creepypasta to actually freak me out was Spin the Wheel.</span><br />
[12:58:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#a8a87e">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:58:46] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ....?</span><br />
[12:59:08] So yeah<br />
[12:59:31] Most personality tests are garbage if they aren't asking ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY<br />
[12:59:51] Color psych is considered garbage<br />
[01:00:00] It depends a lot on your culture<br />
[01:00:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[01:00:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: mhm</span><br />
[01:00:19] Pink is considered a girly color but it used to have masculine overtones<br />
[01:00:28] So the effects of pink have changed<br />
[01:01:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the best creepypasta is killswitch</span><br />
[01:01:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because it could totally be real</span><br />
[01:01:26] So unless you make a version for each culture<br />
[01:01:26] You're inaccurate<br />

[02:56:07] (Not counting my current schedule since it's gonna go back to old tomorrow)<br />
[02:56:22] It's a fake quiz<br />
[02:57:08] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: and bs, I like my color.</span><br />
[02:57:13] It uses "color psych" (read something that is pretty agreed as garbage in psych communities) to determine your whole personality by clicking on colors<br />
[02:57:18] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: It's soothing.</span><br />
[02:57:58] AG: … O.o<br />
[02:58:00] It really just can determine basic things which it then blanket statements and weasel words some stuff to make it looked more detailed<br />

[02:58:23] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Typical</span><br />
[02:58:57] With some guesses here and there<br />
[02:58:57] Like it picked up on DP being spoiled and overreactive so it just said some tropes that apply to people like that most of the time<br />
[02:59:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So in the interest of not being a total hipsterbutt cynic /some/ stuff is kinda on the mark, other stuff isn't really</span><br />

[03:00:50] And the "hates having to deal with everyone acting like kids" thing (no I find it fun)<br />
[03:00:50] But yeah it can get some things<br />
[03:00:50] Issue is it makes a lot of things apply to everyone<br />
[03:00:50] Or make everyone agree with it<br />
[03:00:50] Like<br />
[03:02:18] Everyone can agree with "emotional and sensitive"<br />
[03:02:18] Low self esteem thinks it means negatively<br />
[03:02:19] High thinks it means in a romantic sense<br />
[03:02:19] "I'm not a sissy" admits privately<br />
[03:02:19] Etc<br />
[03:02:19] Geddit?<br />
[03:02:19] Or<br />
[03:02:19] "You like intellectual pursuits but sometimes you just need to relax to mindless activities"<br />
[03:02:34] Given an arbitrary interpretation of sometimes<br />
[03:02:44] It applies to everyone<br />
[03:03:07] And it compliments them by calling them intellectual so they want to believe the words<br />
[03:03:30] (Or if low self esteem, they believe it's criticizing them for doing the latter half)<br />
[03:03:39] The first is a rainbow statement<br />
[03:03:49] The second is weasel wording<br />
[03:04:11] Both are simply appeals to emotion that make it seem correct overall but the details are messy and not that correct<br />
[03:04:15] … I took it for lulz, and, uh.<br />
[03:04:16] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Mine didn't compliment me at all.</span><br />
[03:04:18] Damn this thing is off.<br />
[03:04:53] Mine was only accurate with "emotional and romantic [in a pale sense]"<br />
[03:05:09] Aside from that it just added fake angst<br />

[03:05:23] No I don't hate micromanaging people<br />
[03:06:48] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Feels stressed out due to his current situation, and the demands placed on him. Working on releasing himself from all the things that hold him back, or tie him down. That's pretty accurate. Maybe a bit blanket, but accurate.</span><br />
[03:06:50] Mine would have sounded a lot more correct before I left for college, in which my life is like fucking perfect and I love it.<br />
[03:07:09] My main issue is dysphoria not your fake garbage angst<br />
