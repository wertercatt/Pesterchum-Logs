<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Ah… Mitch, do you know who Bakagami and Ornis are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: Don't let pessimism stop you from exploring your own planet..</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: Or making your own choices..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was saying the "or new" part due to dice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: O-Orn-nis is the uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Other players?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my! That's right, I'd entirely forgotten!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I don't think I've heard of this Bakagami person, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: What an interesting name.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Bakagami is Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: Chronos is what he's usually called..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: his real name is Chronos...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Bakagami AKA Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we call him Bakagami.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: The Lord of Time and Space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AKA Idiot God.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Is it the custom here to nickname things?</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: Not really..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my. A Time Lord.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: hehe</span><br />

<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: d-doowoo oooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: You could just call him "Raging Buttpancake" and people'd know what you mean..</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Should be dead. he got scrathed. and yet he's still fucking alive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...NV are you talking about Seth?</span><br />

<span style="color:#007300">CNV: Takes guts to type out a stutter..</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: uh- I-I</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also I'm pretty sure Chronos' actual claspect is "Douche of Space and Time"... the Skaianet devs actually created the Douche class specifically for him :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I use either eye tracking or voice to text.</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: I prefer "Waste of Time and Space"..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Please don't make fun of him for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: No, no, I'm saying I respect him for it..</span><br />

<span style="color:#007300">CNV: You're welcome, I guess..</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: iτ sounds so familiar</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...huh.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Ah, what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The "Team Candy Red" part.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: That sounds terribly pessimistic… and if I may say so, a bit frightening!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That team name seems VERY familiar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: It's probably nothing..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, let me go get someone.</span><br />

<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'm on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I'd hate to miss something. Hello, ah, other FL!</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Did you honestly call me here to have me just say hello?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: To the new kid?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((hooray, most popul8ted memo on pesterchum!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Then what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does "Team Candy Red" ring any bells?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ????</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I think it did...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what happened</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: bad memories apparenτly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh no!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: t-that's n-no g-good</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CT, that was my Pre-Scratch self.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh… what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He was the "Lord of Blood".</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I'm sorry, I must be missing something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: But how is that possible?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably the only one around here</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: y-you an-nd me b-both</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I don't even understand because Lord is supposed to be reserved to two player sessions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my, I'll have to read up on this later...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: It's a shame there's so little material for this game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, if you know where to look, there is a ton.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh, really? I'd love it if you'd show me, then!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Assuming it isn't all terribly secret, of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Is there any information specifically on Light? I'd like to try to learn a little more about what I might be able to do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: … I'm sorry, did I say something wrong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, just...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you're a Light Player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura is a light player too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I myself am Charles, the ??? of Heart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: That's wonderful to hear!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in fact, until you entered I was the ONLY Light Player...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Yes, I'm a Light player, but I don't know my class yet… oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's okay, none of us do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: I'm Space..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh, wonderful, I was so afraid I was just looking in all the wrong places!</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: D-Doom</span><br />
<span style="color:#007300">CNV: But the common trend is to make up your own class..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP takes both the litteral and obscure meanings of Light into account.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Cool!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Really? I've only figured out how to make things a bit brighter for Mitch, and isn't it luck as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Illumination and Fortune, respectively.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: CP was the only light player of this session before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But those aren't the only meanings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is also Knowledge and Enlightenment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my… I really must look more into this!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...tap tap tap tap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see how many people react to that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Knock four times?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh dear...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like the secret doctor who knock.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: hehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my! Are you the Master, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: … Mitch, please do stop that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: i-if i d-don-n't try to whistle t-then-n how w-will i learn-n?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But oddly the never ending drumbeat seems to be the Heart/Time Fraymotif.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least, thats what mine is titled...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh dear...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still don't know any of the Light fraymotifs since it took me until now to convince my consorts to sell any &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: My consorts are being remarkably stubborn on the matter as well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, level 611... better see about getting some enchanted books.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: But that's okay, I'm sure they have good reason for it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: t-they're r-really rude!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And back down to 600.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: My consorts, I am convinced, keep moving my fraymotifs shop for some reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There we go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: They are not, Mitch. It's rude to call them that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: b-but they are!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't know why, but I always seem to get enchanted books at the enchantment table right before my level hits 612.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I'm sure they have perfectly good reasons for what they do!</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: t-they b-bite me!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, Minecraft Captcharoids are awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Crocs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If not, what are your consorts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mine are Geckos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Leopard Geckos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Minks!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FA, there are worse consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF has giant spiders...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Mine are Wolf Spiders.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: At least, I believe they are. I'm not really good with animals, unfortunately, although I do love them...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: CUTE Wolf Spiders!</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: s-s-spiders?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One of them asked if they could eat me!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It was JOKING, FL!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: D:&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Don't worry, Mitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: IT FUCKING CALLED DIBS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think I'm one of the few players with non-animal consorts... mine are Bob-Ombs. specifically, the ones from Fahr Outpost in Paper Mario TTYD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: t-that's b-better than-n s-sn-nak-k-kes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOU DON'T /JOKE/ ABOUT CALLING DIBS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Your consorts are very cute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Also, I heard that when you tried to squence break through my dungeon, you acessed the spider dimension.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: I-I don-n't lik-k-ke the s-slitherin-ng</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF, Sequence breaking should be a normal plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, most of the minor dungeons on my land actually allow it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well... don't think there are any snake consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, if you don't mind my asking, what are your lands called? just curious...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: i-i have sn-nak-k-kes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: The Land of Traps and Tunnels. And Mitch, I know, that's why you spend the night here so much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For the record, Mine is the Land of Steam and Crossroads.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: LoAaH</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sharing its initials with many other lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like CP's</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right now I'm at our base on the Land of Steam and Crossroads.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Mine is the Land of Webs and Pusle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: i-it's very pretty</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I MEAN</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Mitch, dear, he meant the consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god the verbal fluke</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: o-oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: oh, FL..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I meant the Land of Ink and Roses.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh, that sounds simply beautiful!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah, it is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah... looks better than my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Also, that is Where the HQ is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh, there is a place for players to gather? How nice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I take it everyone has flying gear?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, the gates are all borked, and pickups are inconvinent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: w-w-well yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Of course!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Besides, flying was better than my main plan to bring people to my land before the gates borked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which everyone was terrified of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I'm sorry to hear that!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Captchaing people is frowned on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: don't freaking remind me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes. yes it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ, &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I take it that was because of me accidently punching a card with a consort...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh my… that's possible?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes. It was early on.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh. I can just draw a Brush Portal to most places :P the flightcycle is for show, and/or for going to teleport-disabled areas...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, CP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mind showing everyone the Magicant sometime?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think everyone has seen it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: What's the Magicant?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: I certainly haven't...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: secret hidden warp zone thingie</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, probably a good idea. especially since everyone's gonna have to go there if shit hits the whirling blade pitcher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Skaian Magicant... what SJ said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Void players like Gambit love it... and Space Players hate it.</span><br />
