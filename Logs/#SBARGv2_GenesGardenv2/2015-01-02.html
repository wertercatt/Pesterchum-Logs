<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... let me try to remember... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: dead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, I think I got it... it was way back when we were storming the castle... Kat's castle. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we were walking along, in the creepy gross hallways... and next thing I knew... you weren't around anymore. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that... sounds almost familiar</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...you know, I almost remember that too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: i have no idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think we tried to look for you for a while, but gave up when the Lunar whale was discovered to be missing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: considering we still had like, little to no ability to space. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: according to my memoires i last saw you at around 189 diffrent times and places</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wonderlandDominator <span style="color:#000000">[CWD]</span>  is currently absorbed at a whole mess of holographic screens --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wish i could remember where i went, and why...</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: Elf land??</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually though, I think I actually got a weird pester from you while staying on the Quinn Prime... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: went on about being exiled by a demon crow or something...  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but, it almost seems like that didn't happen. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ...Why dΘes th▲t sΘund f▲mili▲r.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i... kind of remember that</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ▲nd why ▲m I getting ▲ mind im▲ge Θf sΘme crΘw we▲ring ▲ swe▲tervest?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i was in some kind of... facility, like a factory or maybe a spaceship</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: futuristic and metallic</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Th▲t's incredibly silly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: That's what the crow looked like I think ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the group eventually tracked him down in the forest. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Th▲t is the le▲st sc▲riest demΘn crΘw ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there was this epic sky battle ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, now I'm starting to remember that too... the crow was a total pushover compared to some of the stuff I've seen universe-hopping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and by epic, i mean slightly dangerous for my little brother. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: definitely dont remember that</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wonderlandDominator <span style="color:#000000">[CWD]</span>  slides a few holographic windows over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: when we captured the crow, he told us where to find you. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Some place called the... resort dimension? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i faintly remember something like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, a couple days later, we summoned him to some forbidden crater on augataur, in some kin da gay baby jail or something, to get the coordinates to the place. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wonderlandDominator <span style="color:#000000">[CWD]</span>  snickers --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think the black obalisk from 2001 a space oddesy was there for some reason. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: G...g▲y b▲by j▲il..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's a birb joke. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so far so nonsensical</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: later that day, we went to the guest house and settled down for the day, planning on going to the resort the next day. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: next thing I know, I'm suddenly in charcherry again, with memories of being on a christmas planet for five years. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and one dinner party later, here we are. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so you still have some gaps too</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think so... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: at least you can remember some things</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just have, like... images</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: weird happening</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the weird futuristic place i mentioned earlier, and the crow... i remember flying through meteors, even bowing to chronos as some version of myself</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though i have no idea why</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Wh▲t.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ....what ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wonderlandDominator <span style="color:#000000">[CWD]</span>  all the holorgrams collapse --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like i say, i dont remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i hope it wasn't, like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: me me</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: It better nΘt be</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait... I remember looking up a thing on a viewfinder... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: viewport, whatever ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe i had some ulterior motive</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: getting close to him to stab him in the back, or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i can't remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was doing some investigation on an alternate version of Seth that has been bothering our pre-reset counterparts... and for some reason there was some version of you there in the footage. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but it was an alternate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats good, at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘ wΘnder they were lΘΘking fΘr ▲ Ben.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not sure. I think it must have been... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: they?</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: preset nerds</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the pre-reset crew. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: not very good</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they call themselves the lost pawns apparently. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a lethargic bunch of kids hanging out in the depressing void. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and i assume theyre looking for another version of me</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: apparently. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: most of what I know is what i've been able to gather over the memo they use. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and some stuff occasionally in the tags on tumblr ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: huh, alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anything else you would like to know? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I tΘt▲lly respect th▲t.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...yeah. doesn't make much sense to me either. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: better than killing people</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: True</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...you dont kill people anymore right</span><br />

<span style="color:#860000">CNK: Height issue</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think he gave up on that after Charles was a no-show for a call-out though. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's kinda hard to tell sometimes. lie, he's still really intimidating sometimes, maybe even more than he used to be when he was shorter, but I can kinda tell that he's been really taking those anger management courses seriously. ➜</span><br />
