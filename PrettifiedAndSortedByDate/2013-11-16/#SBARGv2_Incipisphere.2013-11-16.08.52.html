<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't know I mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It /could/ be my casual ribing of John as Kira thanks to his latest weapon</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But that's obviously a joke and getting worried over it would be exceedingly silly</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So it's gotta be something else </span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: o-o???</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh man I'm such a derp it's gotta be about, tomorrow, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah that makes much more sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...sorry, I didn't get the context of what you were talking about</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I should have just assumed you were talking about anime</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...If anyone does decide to go, I want you to bring Crux with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll make sure to use the magicant to go over when/if we win.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually, shouldn't the Magicant /itself/ be safe enough for the pups? considering you can't port in, only go through existing entrances (or my Door Station, which I need to remember to captcha tonight)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: According to turningpoint, Chronos can't go to earth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Also according to that, he expects that to be temporary. So he's still got some plan or other for trying to get around it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then Seth screwed over that plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: CN: HEHEHE... FΘR THE MΘMENT I'M RESTR▲INED TΘ THIS INCIPISPHERE. BUT TH▲T WΘN'T L▲ST.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe...I don't wanna rule anything out, and it sounds like he might have had a plan otherwise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But see, its the safest place they could be, is what I'm trying to say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But what do I know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...If we don't win there's a good chance there won't /be/ a safe place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But it /will/ prevent a hostage situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This isn't a fight we can lose. It's as simple as that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, tonight, if no one's heading to earth to hide, I'll send Crux and Kutone into the Magicant and then captcha the door behind them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...should we also do the same for all those consort ships?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, what is your current status with alternate selves?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What are you talking about?</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'm scared.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Currently, to protect any non participants of the upcoming battle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what FL said</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: since sylladexes wouldn't actually be safe for them, since you drop your inventory on (perma)death</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmmm Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ok then. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Woot</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As a Knight of Hope you tend to "weaponize" your Hope towards achieving your goals. You seem to have a boundless enthusiasm but you don't seem to lend Hope to others. Often your actions leave othe rplayers irked but they are always done with the best intentions in mind.  Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Basically you provide Hope for yourself and use it to move forward but can't do the same for others. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: social analanak??</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Welll, I have it on good authority that I give good advice, and help people out whenever, however</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: So that,s not entirely correct</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: But mostly it is! :-) </span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but it is. Advice is not the same as Hope though they can be linked if you do so with the intent to provide more options or good feelings. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Which I dooo</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Not done yet. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Furthermore when you do advise other you tend to provide yourself with Hope first before you act and help them. Just because you sometimes give good advice doesn't mean you can give Hope to others all the time. Its more that you use your own Hope to bolster your efforts, using your near infinite cheer to effect others. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah um</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Now, as for you naK you have a rather interesting effect as the Bard of Void. As a passive destructive class you interact with your element indirectly. Whereas Gambit actively steals from the unknown by finding things out, you tend to be a maker and builder. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ What I've noticed is that people tend to rely on your to change things in their favor. Your portals are vital to dungeoneering and you work on changing the level of knowledge of everyone by actively seeking new things. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's see how you play this one out Reid</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ To be honest your role is somewhat similar to Jade's.
