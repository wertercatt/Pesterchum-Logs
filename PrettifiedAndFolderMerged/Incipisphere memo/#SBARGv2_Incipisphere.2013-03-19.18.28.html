<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: a baby consort thought they were tattoos, and asked if I was in the yakuza or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, how would they know about the yakuza?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: shrug</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sorry if I'm being nosy</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: signnnn.....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what is there even to DO out here? My bro is too busy whining and my sprite constantly spews these stupid inspirational sports movie speeches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have my house pretty much on lock-down, so there's no worries there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but now that's out of the way, what are we supposed to even be doing while we're waiting for these stupid broken gates?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: go to sleep. have fun on the dream moons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sleeping doesn't solve everything, you know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually you have to wake up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, I might be due for a particilarly long crash.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I know, just saying that's basically the only thing to do other than explore your land right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: been sleeping only about 5-6 hours a night lately.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe my bro's right and I really am paranoid...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the past few nights, I've slept in a consort village instead of my dwelling spire because despite the stat bonuses they give, I'm sick of being vandalized by ammysprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: have you thought of telling her to do the stat booster things on tags instead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: that might be a good idea, actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that way, you could always store them when you're not fighting. </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I just hope this stuff washes off... then again, knowing weird plot shit &amp;&amp; magic sprite powers || that one consort's remark, they probably won't</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if this game is as genre following as the most devout tv troper, I wouldn't be surprized.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what am I even drabbling?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: though to be fair, compared to everything else in this game (never mind the glitch pile that won't keep from getting taller), having your sprite indelibly turn you into a human scroll is almost a non-issue</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (and for all I know, they'll go away when I get the tiger since my dreamself is kanji-free)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whenever somebody mentions glitches, all i can think about is MG...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: last time she was in here,</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I've seen several references to the glitch gremlin, and I think a doomed past me accidentally prototyped a missingno</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've heard you say that like, 32 times already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: oh frogs I hope our first guardian was smart enough to code an insta-doomline failsafe if someone prototyped Sonic '06</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((sorry, tired irl and can't remember what I said when, both ic and ooc))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, the game itself erased itself from its own timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((so yeah, I should olly))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: from what I gathered watching the cutscenes on youtube</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so in a sense, it wouldn't even need an external failsafe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, unless it got disabled somehow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which would probably happen anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: should probably catch some Z's soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm starting to ramble.</span><br />
