[05:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its a... feeling.</span><br />
[05:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I can't really assign a number to it.</span><br />
[05:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And I don't think a baslisk made it through the armor, so...</span><br />
[05:41] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: Where does this feeling come from?</span><br />
