[09:34:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Illumination and Fortune, respectively.</span><br />
[09:34:15] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: CP was the only light player of this session before.</span><br />
[09:34:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But those aren't the only meanings.</span><br />

[09:35:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...tap tap tap tap.</span><br />
[09:35:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see how many people react to that.</span><br />
[09:35:21] <span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Knock four times?</span><br />

[09:37:14] <span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: Oh dear...</span><br />

[09:38:51] <span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: My consorts are being remarkably stubborn on the matter as well...</span><br />

[09:39:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And back down to 600.</span><br />
[09:39:25] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: My consorts, I am convinced, keep moving my fraymotifs shop for some reason.</span><br />
[09:39:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There we go.</span><br />
[09:39:53] <span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: They are not, Mitch. It's rude to call them that.</span><br />
[09:40:01] <span style="color:#6eadff">CFA: b-but they are!</span><br />
[09:40:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't know why, but I always seem to get enchanted books at the enchantment table right before my level hits 612.</span><br />
[09:40:15] <span style="color:#ff0097">CCT: I'm sure they have perfectly good reasons for what they do!</span><br />
