<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hah... Good going.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If I meet him again, we are going to have a serious talk on how to actually be taken seriously and be a credible threat. Actually, no, I'll probably just kick him in the nuts again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sorry 'bout that, FF, if you feel it anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but uh yeah, Igottago</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Best. Helpers. Ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((So uh... how did I do?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No problem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( I liked the part where the boss pelted us with lamps. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I think it was pretty awesome))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((heh. thanks.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( Needs more loot, but I've gtg ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((I liked the spider-secret section and the dungeon was pretty interesting, the ending was pretty cool, and the music was kickin'))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((thank you!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I think I'll get going too. Nice talk, Raz. (( I want to talk to DF more. We have so much to talk about. I liked the secrets, you could tell 'cause I was laughing my ass off. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah, a tad lacking in the secrets department, but it flowed pretty well from room to room, though maybe some parts were a little rushed.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( byes! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((yeah... sorry bout that.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *phases out and glides off into who-knows-where*</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((anyways. thanks for particpating))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((Lack of loot was a bit of an issue too, as was progression that was pretty much inoffensive, but unchallenging. We basically just walked a straight path, and the only part where we needed to do anything other then something incredibly basic was the afformentioned spider part))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( EVERYTHING needs more loot ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((it was still pretty fun for a first shot))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((I know, I know... Well, lets say you got alot of grist and boobnbucks then))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((For having three challenges as a backbone you should put more focus on them and make them suitably dramatic. But yeah, not bad for pretty much your first time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((yeah, wanted to keep it simple, for the first time.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...So, dream you got locked away...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((If I do another dungeon, it will probably involve the GodMonster... and that will probably give LOTs of loot.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...A dreamself is supposed to be a representation of us, I think. On some level, that was you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's weirdy contrary... What I'm trying to say, I mean. I guess, try not to forget who you are. And try not to let who you are be determined by anything other then you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I /hope/ that's not a two-bit villain but if it is...Boy that would suck.</span><br />
