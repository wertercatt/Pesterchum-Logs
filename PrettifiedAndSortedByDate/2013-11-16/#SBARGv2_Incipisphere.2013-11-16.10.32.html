Just because you sometimes give good advice doesn't mean you can give Hope to others all the time. Its more that you use your own Hope to bolster your efforts, using your near infinite cheer to effect others. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh hey nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: um</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: (⌣_⌣”)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Give me a sec to get to you naK Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Dealing with idiots over on LoSaS at the moment &gt;_&gt;;; Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whats that mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: I see! So, I'm kinda like the spritely little brother of the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's just...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So many bad things happening here</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That is what it appears to be PO. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah um</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Now, as for you naK you have a rather interesting effect as the Bard of Void. As a passive destructive class you interact with your element indirectly. Whereas Gambit actively steals from the unknown by finding things out, you tend to be a maker and builder. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i know you and amy were friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sorry i killed her</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: (▰˘︹˘▰)	</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a2a280">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ By your actions though you enable your aspect to be destroyed and find enjoyment in it's destruction. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Void is the unknown and the aspect of nothingness. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ By indirectly "destroying" Void, you tend to be the one to facilitate the making and learning of new things and ideas. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Naaaaak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I notice that you tend to like making items and learning new things. You started out with almost no knowledge of human speech and have been teaching yourself how to speak it. You even helped others come up with new ideas and nicknames. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so say we all</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: What about me, CA? If you don't mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i gtg tho</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: gnight SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and CA, I think I might jump on this too after MP's turn...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm well Time is all about uncertainty and inevitability. As the Prince of Time I've noticed that you've been in situations where you've either had to be decisive in your actions or suffer some consequence. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((seeya guys later))</span><br />
