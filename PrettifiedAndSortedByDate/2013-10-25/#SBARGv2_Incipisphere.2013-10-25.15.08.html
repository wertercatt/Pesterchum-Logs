[03:10:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Looks like I can /finally/ be of use to this session.</span><br />
[03:10:10] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Who is not Charles.</span><br />

[03:11:20] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Okay see the fact that I /knew/ you were going to say that FL just makes it all the more worse.</span><br />
[03:12:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might as well be a test subject... Its not like I would be good at anything else...</span><br />
[03:12:38] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: Not with that mentality, you won't</span><br />
[03:13:12] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yeah well what I'm testing is stuff about Time.</span><br />

[03:14:01] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: Interesting!</span><br />
[03:14:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh, in that case, I would likely ruin the tests</span><br />
[03:15:12] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
[03:15:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: keep any and all methods of time travel away from me.</span><br />
[03:15:52] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: You never listen to anything that will actually better you, and you keep focusing on how much you're useless. Then again you're probably covering your ears /as usual/</span><br />
[03:15:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: God knows it would only end in a doomed timeline.</span><br />
[03:16:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I guess I /might/ be similar to an Espurr... naw. That doesn't fit me at all.</span><br />
[03:16:50] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...Hm. Hey Niki, you're not participating in the tournament are you?</span><br />
[03:17:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope. ➜</span><br />
[03:17:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles has an addiction to whining like a 4 year old, usual friday afternoon</span><br />

[03:17:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sure. ➜</span><br />

[03:25:31] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: No, but does it matter?</span><br />
[03:25:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know its I after E except after C...</span><br />

[03:30:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((KH, you might want to leave the pirates memo, you left it open))</span><br />
[03:31:00] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Mm, well! Just a little worried about people knowing stuff I'm going to use for the matches, so as long as you don't tell anyone else we'll be cool!</span><br />

[03:32:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, uh, so I shouldn't come over to watch since I'm in the tournament?</span><br />
[03:33:14] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Prooooobably not. </span><br />
[03:33:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fair enough.</span><br />

[03:35:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like what ;o?</span><br />
[03:36:25] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Water ballooning random people.</span><br />

[03:38:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: water balloons? :P</span><br />
[03:48:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to calculate the code for the Matriorb (just because I am bored), but I am having some slight issues... ah well, I'll figure it out soon.</span><br />
[03:49:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far, I have the code for a potted plant and a certain fedora (god bless Shaving Almanac &amp;&amp; T-Bone Steak), but I'm having issues finding a copy of Charles Duttons Dream Bubbles... but I will get it soon.</span><br />
[03:50:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just need to bring down the number of components, I know its an &amp;&amp; Involving the Dutton Photo...</span><br />

[03:50:57] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I came in here to tell you to /stop/</span><br />
[03:51:01] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No.</span><br />

[03:51:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes Kimura, that is the code for a Cruxite Dowel.</span><br />
[03:51:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000c1">CURRENT matrixAssassin [CMA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:51:31] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: I'm going to ask how you even knew he was rambling.</span><br />
[03:51:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I heard through the grapevine that someone was trying to do something stupid.</span><br />
[03:51:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that wasn't meant to be a captchacode. that was a response to RS.</span><br />
[03:52:03] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: He literally /just/ started.</span><br />
[03:52:08] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Rob has spidey senses</span><br />
[03:52:14] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Except with stupidity instead</span><br />
[03:52:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I may have mentioned</span><br />
[03:52:31] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Oh well that would explain it.</span><br />
[03:52:34] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll be honest Charles is kind of the butt of all the jokes I have with Rob</span><br />
[03:52:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, aside from the ones that I'm the butt of, but those are mostly insults.</span><br />
[03:53:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably different category.</span><br />
[03:53:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah those are palsy-insults I have like 8 categories of insults</span><br />
[03:54:03] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: This doesn't surprise me in the least.</span><br />
[03:54:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I'm just doing it as a test for reverse engineering codes.</span><br />
[03:54:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay.</span><br />
[03:54:30] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's play this game, then. Why would you want to do something like that?</span><br />
[03:54:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its something that I feel that I am /decent/ at.</span><br />
[03:55:44] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So... because you want to?</span><br />
[03:56:25] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hm.</span><br />
[03:57:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I want to go down as someone who /actually/ knew how to calculate codes for punch card alchemy instead of getting a gravestone with "Idot" written on it.</span><br />
[03:57:35] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Honestly I don't think there's all that much to be explored as far as alchemy is concerned, beyond seeing what something might make with another thing, or some shit like that.</span><br />
[03:58:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Recipe Modus states that the Hard-Boiled Fedora is a Potted Plant &amp;&amp; Dream Bubbles || Matriorb.</span><br />
[03:58:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far, I have the Hard-Boiled Fedora and Potted Plant codes.</span><br />
[03:59:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cz!Z!l!k and CuPA8LnQ respectively.</span><br />
[03:59:26] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So you're saying you're trying to figure out how to get the codes for the other two things.</span><br />
[03:59:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, exactly.</span><br />
[04:00:04] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: And what exactly do you have to benefit from this, other than being known as the guy that messed around with alchemy a lot?</span><br />
[04:00:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a perfect process, But I can narrow it down to say, 2^18 items so far for what /might/ be the code for Dream Bubbles.</span><br />
[04:00:50] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: That doesn't answer my question.</span><br />
[04:01:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I can get the code for the Matriorb, I could potentially get the code for other items that may be more importaint to us.</span><br />
[04:01:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like?</span><br />
[04:02:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know.</span><br />
[04:02:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[04:02:25] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch.</span><br />
[04:02:57] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: See, this would be more credible if you actually had something that everyone could agree would be a good idea to figure out how to get without having obtained the code in the first place.</span><br />
[04:03:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You had such a good streak of being semi-cool, too. Like last night was actually pretty great.</span><br />
[04:03:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CMP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[04:03:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we might not need to know the item we need /now/</span><br />
[04:03:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And now you're dedicating yourself to a process whose fruits you don't even /know/ for the sake of, doing something worthwhile?</span><br />
[04:03:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let me save your time. It's not this.</span><br />
[04:04:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but eventually, you might see something in the Recipe modus that you might want</span><br />
[04:05:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Reverse engineering canon item codes when we've got a perfectly good trove of unplumbed things here? Seriously?</span><br />
[04:05:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I'm /bored/</span><br />
[04:05:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not like I got anything else to do.</span><br />
[04:05:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Why not try going into a dungeon? Your land has those, right?</span><br />
[04:05:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: make things that aren't from video games</span><br />
[04:05:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: or from a pre-existing canon</span><br />
[04:05:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You don't even need to drag anyone along just take one on solo, I do it all the time.</span><br />
[04:06:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The last dungeon I have on my land seems to be an... extra dungeon.</span><br />
[04:06:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 100 floors of pain.</span><br />
[04:06:54] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
[04:07:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, Pit of 100 Trials. which neither of us have done our respective lands' version of that.</span><br />

[04:08:08] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're telling me there are /no/ more dungeons on your land? You did them all? And none of them repeat or anything?</span><br />
[04:08:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Ash, no, I think it's kind of a rare spawn.</span><br />
[04:08:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mine has one because of the source material used, not sure why one also spawned on LoSaCrossroads...</span><br />
[04:09:18] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Christ whatever happened to good-old adventuring? Dungeons with some fights and puzzles, maybe a mini-boss or an end-boss. Sweet loot too of course, of some sort or other.</span><br />
[04:09:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or side-quests. Consorts are /tripping/ those things. Absolutely tripping 'em.</span><br />
[04:09:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either my land fucked up with the dungeon generation (only spawning necessary dungeons) or they are buried so far into the land I will never find them.</span><br />

[07:54:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, there are people who aren't insane who think they are.</span><br />
[07:56:09] <span style="color:#d3661d">CPO: Yes.</span><br />
[07:57:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As for me, I believe since none of us behave normally, we could all be considered insane to those on beta earth... I'm just considered insane by those who are also insane.</span><br />
[07:57:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm Insane x2.</span><br />
[07:58:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't think...you understand the difference between "insanity" and "deviance"</span><br />
[07:59:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "in a state of mind that prevents normal perception, behavior, or social interaction; seriously mentally ill."</span><br />

[08:01:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're asking me what normal is at this point</span><br />
[08:01:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you want a real answer or "we're all super weird lolololo x3"</span><br />
[08:01:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, after all, I am not.</span><br />

[08:02:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No but I have a bloody sociology textbook sitting right here.</span><br />
[08:03:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright here we go lemme bust out what the definition of "normal" is so you can at least say you know ONE thing</span><br />
[08:03:54] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Normal is the behavior that is consistent with the various values, morals, and norms of a culture</span><br />
[08:04:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...we have a culture?</span><br />
[08:04:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we came from a culture ➜</span><br />
[08:06:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So, for example, culture I used to live in had a hardcore emphasis on common sense/responsibility/not being a scrub</span><br />
[08:07:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So when I see things like "Wweh I'm sad and won't do anything/I'm the cancer of the session and still won't do anything"</span><br />
[08:07:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's some deviant fucking behavior, and is most heinous</span><br />
[08:08:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But see it's totally cool if your only definition of a culture/sanction is circle-jerking yourself</span><br />
[08:09:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not really when one cares about what other people thing about them more than what they think of themselves.</span><br />
[08:09:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow, if you look up now you MIGHT catch the point going over your head at Mach 7.</span><br />
[08:10:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The point is I need to stop being negative, right?</span><br />
[08:10:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is the point that I shouldn't give a fuck at all?</span><br />
[08:10:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The point is you need to stop being a little bitch</span><br />
[08:10:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's the point</span><br />
[08:10:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's hard when you've been raised in a culture where bitchitude of such magnitude is accepted</span><br />
[08:10:58] <span style="color:#d3661d">CPO: Heh.</span><br />
