[04:22:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically trying to shake things up for a pokemon fangame/hack/whatever</span><br />
[04:23:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think rock/flying/fighting and sort of psychic/fighting/dark were the only ones in gen 5...</span><br />
[04:23:15] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: idk if the gen 6 type chart changed it at all</span><br />

[04:29:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, thats enough.</span><br />
[04:29:30] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: for you but</span><br />
[04:29:38] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just wanna figure out what all of them are</span><br />
[04:29:40] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: for my own purposes</span><br />
[04:29:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, okay.</span><br />
[04:29:46] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and for future reference</span><br />

[04:32:42] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: my brain hurts too much to continue</span><br />
[04:34:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So uh, if you took a bunch of factors into consideration... how powerful would V-Create be in a pokemon lore type basis?</span><br />
[04:40:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Earthquake only has a power of 100... but V Create has like... 180.</span><br />
[04:42:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is more powerful than Magnitude 10. (with a power of 150)</span><br />
[04:44:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So uh... I guess what I'm trying to say is... It could replace an influential weapon in history?</span><br />
[04:47:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You all are at the bar drinking without me, aren't you.</span><br />
[04:49:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fine, I'll just... DEEP FRY CHOCOLATE COVERED BACON.</span><br />
[04:52:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, I'm there now... it's just me, EQ, IB, and one of the alien visitors, and all of us are just zoning out.</span><br />
[04:53:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Man, this is /so good/</span><br />
[04:54:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mmmmm</span><br />
[04:54:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ew</span><br />
[04:54:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit FL. at least share some of that &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
[04:54:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Chocolate.</span><br />
[04:54:47] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... /Ew./ Deep fried... chocolate covered... Bacon.</span><br />

[04:55:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is delicious.</span><br />
[04:55:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Sure doesnt sound delicious</span><br />
[04:56:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, it is /very/ delicious. Too bad you are all at the bar not paying attention and missing out, huh?</span><br />
[04:56:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: F_L</span><br />
[04:57:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I might understand its due to Scion, but FL sure doesn't. ))</span><br />
[04:57:27] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Have fun with your diabetes, FL.</span><br />
[04:57:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((actually, nothing's really going on in there either right now))</span><br />
[04:58:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: mmm, so delicious</span><br />
[04:58:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((we had our test session yesterday, but not actually doing anything today other than watching reactions to SL's summary post on /tg/...))</span><br />
[04:59:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyway, thoughts before I put V-Create into the plot of my Pokemon Story as basically a nuke?</span><br />
[05:02:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.</span><br />
[05:02:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also FL, as an attempt to convince you to come back, have SL's summary of yesterday's test. <a href='https://boards.4chan.org/tg/res/29586430'>https://boards.4chan.org/tg/res/29586430</a> ))</span><br />
[05:04:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...that just gives me reason /not to/ ))</span><br />
[05:04:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( :( ))</span><br />
[05:06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL? EQ? Thoughts?</span><br />
[05:06:42] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: eh</span><br />
[05:06:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh...</span><br />
[05:07:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not really, to be quite honest.</span><br />
[05:07:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway FL, you better start sharing that bacon...</span><br />
[05:07:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So no objections?</span><br />
[05:07:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, what bacon?</span><br />

[05:08:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh.</span><br />
[05:12:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, I could be lying about that and just have a /ton/ of bacon to myself which I won't share.</span><br />
[05:12:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But really, would I lie about lying?</span><br />
[05:13:14] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yes</span><br />
