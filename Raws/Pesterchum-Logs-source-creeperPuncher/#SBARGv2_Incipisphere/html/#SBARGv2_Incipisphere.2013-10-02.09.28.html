<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I could probably get a sapling or a few from my consorts, they're nice like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: heh, maybe you can turn the nuclear wasteland into a big garden</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And working on their own attempt at sprucing up their land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe they could give your consorts pointers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: with all the exotic flora across the incipisphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: my land doesn't have all that much interesting plantlife, mostly just really short patchy grass. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, when I put the soul back SL, it turned the crater into a meadow of grass</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what do you mean, what does she like</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: I mean, what does she like to do. I know several of my consorts like mock combat and such, for example.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: well, then what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: setting up a spider play-date I think? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: at least youre learning</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: gotten over your weird obsession</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly, Its never a good thing to blow things up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: even with gunpowder</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey, would anyone be interested in a table kicking contest? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: never played</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty much just kick a table in the coolest way possible. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: since distance based tends to get out of hand. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dropkicking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that works. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll be getting the stuff set up on my land. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm thinking it'll be in about a half hour. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't /kick/ tables</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I launch them at incredible speeds using my sylladex</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how many points do I get for orbiting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: depends on how cool it looks. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sylladex ejecting a table so it orbits a land</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ill try to slip out and leave amy to radd</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm afraid if I tried to kick a table normally I might break my foot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the points will be done 1-10, rated seperately by everyone involved ((and mostly based off of description quality)) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might have to pass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: how come</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.bobandgeorge.com/archives/030122'>http://www.bobandgeorge.com/archives/030122</a></span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats a blast from the pas</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: t</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wat ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah needs more context</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he's referring to the point system ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a way to even it out is to record it and do the point stuff way later after watching the tapes a bunch and stuff maybe. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: nah why bother</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no need to make it a big thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just suggesting. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a better idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we have a picnic</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: listening ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on my land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((bluh... kinda need to have a shower now, but at the same time if an event's about to start...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ooh, that sounds cool ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets do it later</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, 45 minutes or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sounds good. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: picnic/garden planting party?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ill bring roses</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, tablekicks and picnics at 3?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, that is basically what it is SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll bring the tables ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ehhhh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its obvious Ash is the best table kicker in the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so its really just gonna be a fight for second place</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...i guess im leaving amy to radd</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eh, it's not supposed to be about the competition, it's supposed to be an excuse to bring us together. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, you can't beat orbiting multiple gravity wells and getting it to land exactly where it was</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((this should be a no-drama event))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and because I really just want to kick some tables. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((gotcha))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yespls))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...christ, should i bring amy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: urgh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( lets hope chronos doesn't catch wind of it ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its not really using a computer, now is it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but yeah, are we starting now or at 3?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: guess not</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously what did you limit her to on the grounding</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((if by 3 you mean a half-hour))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((3 probably))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( 5PM, central time ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok, brb turbo shower mode))</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i only said computer and video games, but staying at home was implied</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: though i guess if its with me i can still call it part of the grounding</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does she like icecream?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause I'll bring it any not let her have any if you think thats a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and(</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and*</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: nah, shes more of a meat girl</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay then</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: by which i mean she is only capable of eating meat, so im not depriving her of that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: lolcarnivorism</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: looks like I'll fix up a sal-</span><br />
