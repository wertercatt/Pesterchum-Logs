[04:20:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Alright.</span><br />
[04:20:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: The plan is to shove both of them into a Coop session of portal 2.</span><br />
[04:20:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ...oh snap, this should be /good/.</span><br />
[04:21:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: with you replacing GLaDOS/the Announcer, I'm guessing?</span><br />
[04:21:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'll replace GlaDOS.</span><br />
[04:21:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah.</span><br />
[04:21:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I might be able to load some... /different/ custom maps.</span><br />
[04:21:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ooh.</span><br />
[04:22:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ok, is the sim going to be /literally/ Portal 2's engine, or just similar to it?</span><br />
[04:22:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Same scenario, actual physics.</span><br />
[04:22:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: because spectating should be a thing no matter what version of Source Engine...</span><br />
[04:22:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ah, so "like it, but realistic".</span><br />
[04:23:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Since the AU Machine naturally simulates physics down to the quantum level.</span><br />
[04:24:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: so, the giant alien elephant in the room: how do we get Silas back and get him to agree to go in the machine?</span><br />
[04:24:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: We wait.</span><br />
[04:24:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: After all, he needs to sleep /some time/.</span><br />
[04:25:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ohhhhhhhh... I see.</span><br />
[04:25:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: wait for him to go to sleep, stick the helmet on him, and game_start()</span><br />
[04:26:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah.</span><br />
[04:27:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I should be able to get the cameras exporting a live feed to the TV in the Bar.</span><br />
[04:28:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: cool</span><br />
[04:29:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ...I could still act as external mission control though just in case...</span><br />
[04:29:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah.</span><br />
[04:30:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Of course, for now we can't tell them.</span><br />
[04:30:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Else they will try to prevent it from happening.</span><br />
[04:31:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, BH knows, but he won't know the sleeping plan.</span><br />
[04:31:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: mmk</span><br />
