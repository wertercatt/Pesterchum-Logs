<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, how much power is used in maintaining the shields.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as the energy of a shield would be constantly used going outwards... it is likely the shields would drop during warp.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008400">CDS: I cant describe how it works because scince hasnt caught up yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The shields are hooked into the power supply of the ship, and when the warp engine is going on, that energy is lessened, causing shields not to be as strong.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember those plasma orbs in your house?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats prove that energy shielding is possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: The matter antimater reaction produses engergy far in ecsess of what is neaded for warp power</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except the energy required to shield something has to be equal to or greater than the energy released against the shield, and has to maintain that at a constant output. </span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: which is why it can oly take so mutch before the generators overload.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except it could also be short bursts if the computer can calculate the energy required to block /every object/</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: its not</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Its a bubble or else a transporter could penitrate</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But see, short bursts would enable more effective shielding if you could get it to work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and lower power would be enough to block a transporter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But right now, it would take swapping out the onboard systems with quantum computers in order to get the processing speed required.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i tried so hard and i got so far</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also what</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: random encounter modus. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sounds exciting</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It was weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i might have to ask about that modus actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sounds fun</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im still so hype about going to space tho</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: night</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Niiight</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Yeah seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just cant wait to go to space</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup, should be lots of fun</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wish it wasn't so heavily implied that it's going to involve full trekkie protocol. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just wanna explore a whole bunch, the precise mechanics dont really matter to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Same here, really. I dont care what happens really, as long as something happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm worried about screwing something up on the ship. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: which is why I really don'τ wanτ τo go</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think ds kinda has his own crew</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or worse, FL screwing something up on the ship. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That he does- oh good point... Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, whatever borks, can be fixed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill kinda just be on my own in the lunar whale</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, DS brought a lot of his consorts with him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I don'τ wanτ τo be caughτ up wiτh Spacepanτs' sτar τrek feτish</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if things get too weird, i think i can probablyget a warp core and go off on my own</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if things get too protocol-y</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might be a good idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: defs</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Smart</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like im fine with being in the hold with this weird star trek thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: might want to get one anyway, in case we have to abscond somewhere and the evac pads break.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think ill let his consort mechanics install it, actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: only one question: where do you even find a warp core? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Can't be too safe with that sort of thing, yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: noτ τhaτ I can'τ jusτ fly ouτside in deep space</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'm made of magic coddamniτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... its built generally, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think ds has some someplace in that massive fucking ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: How? I have no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: a spare or 2</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CBH</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i figure when/if i go off and do thing itll be like</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: cruising the universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: driftin'</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fair enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sounds like a plan. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that was kind of my plan to begin with but</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, something I gotta remember to test out: what my range limit is on brushportalling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well you could do it anywhere in the incipisphere right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but that's a pretty contained range. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, but that's probably 100 miles in diameter at the most...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But the incipi was fairly small, compated to... space itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: more than 100 miles i should think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i explored most of it one time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its pretty big</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yes, but even then: It is tiny compared to a universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but between it and the transportalizers back home</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So, testing out the range of brushportaling again could not hurt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we should be fine for most things</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...funny what reminds you of people huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what reminds you of who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...when i explored the incipisphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it was to find where to take quinn on our first date</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: oh dear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont worry too much about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ive accepted... what happened</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but i still think about it sometimes</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im just happy i got to spend time with her</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wish it hadnt ended, but... im glad we were together while we could be</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: eh, you dont want to listen to me whine about my dead girlfriend anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: has anyone but fl found any planets to visit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, it'll be easier to tell, once we are in space, but... maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: um....I've never acτually looked anywhere beyond here .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I mean: I might have found something, but due to lack of good tech and a weak signal, I am not so sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If I can get a stronger signal once we are all off, then I'll know for sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: anything interesting about it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Again: I can't really tell much about it. However, if they are sending out a signal, I would assume they have tecnology of some sort. Or weird plants/animals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i hope its the latter</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((Lets watch EQ try and cover up the fact that she has too many ideas and cannot choose just one for now :U ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((not a bad thing))</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah, lots of ideas can be good as long as you narrow it down sooner or later))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((we can get to all of them eventually))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((Yes, and I am slowly putting them in a linear order... keyword: slowly. This is what happens when you let a person who knows waaay too much science fiction write stuff))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((I cannot 5cience fiction to 5ave my life))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i think planets of any genre are acceptable))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((speaking of which eq you better have some alien-style sci-fi horror in there))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((Agreed. As long as it can fit on a planet, it should work-))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((SL I'm trying to stop that from happening do not encourage me))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((no i /love/ dark sci-fi horror))</span><br />
