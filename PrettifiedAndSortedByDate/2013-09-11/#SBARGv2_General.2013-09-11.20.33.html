<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, so this friday's "thing" is in fact a hotel event? cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000"></span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah, a continuation of a previous hotel event that was kind of left in the air :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm sure you can still join in and it can be worked into the plot :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I think the last hotel thing I was able to go to was /part 2 of TT's ink thingy story/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: in some ways, I feel like even the main rp, sbargv2, people have started to lose faith in that. And I'm more or less a minor character (by choice, I still have fun) nor do I really run the rp, but it kind of sucks to see others lose interest in it, especially since I used to think that I would never want to be a part of it, and now that I'm just starting to enjoy it, some people are falling out with</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't want to think of that as a lost cause, though :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I mean, there's already been a lot of work put into it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't think it's people losing faith in v2, it's more of that summer's over, school's hitting a lot of people and flushing their free time down the gaper...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: That could be it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and if anything, a change in pace with their occupied time will probably get them more interested in the RP in their free time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I know after a long day of work, it makes me more motivated to do other things for fun. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, and the creator of Scott Pilgrim and Andrew Hussie had a conversation on twitter. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP:  <a href='http://media.tumblr.com/c5e7399df1aa97df0eba1a16207fd268/tumblr_inline_msziruJlL61qz4rgp.png'>http://media.tumblr.com/c5e7399df1aa97df0eba1a16207fd268/tumblr_inline_msziruJlL61qz4rgp.png</a> :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: I've lost interest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: To be quite honest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft, wow, that convo ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I know, SA. I wish I could figure out a way to have all those who lost interest to gain interest back in it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok that convo was funny</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: it's the little things that put a smile on my face :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I kinda want a legend of zelda game where zelda is the protaganist/main character. And maybe for added measure, even has to rescue link. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Maybe link is a prince :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and zelda is a villager :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And then at the end, patrick stewart can narrate, or morgan freeman, and go "and this is how zelda became a legend" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: There'ʃ a guy who conceptualized an entire game around an idea ʃimilar to that</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'd seriously want to play that :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I wanted to turn it into an actual fan-game, but he never contacted me back</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: SS, I would have played it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Or, I think there's been similar things done, but to my knowledge, not been done completely (at least with what I'm thinking of) :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But I'd like to see a complete co-op game with Link and Zelda :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And they're both useful :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and they're both alive :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and stuff :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: have you ʃeen the game Brotherʃ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: brothers? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: you control two brotherʃ ʃimultaneouʃly uʃing the two joyʃtickʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I've played "superbrothers swords and sorcery" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but not sure if that's what you mean :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: it'ʃ apparently really good</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: it'ʃ not what i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: umm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: hold on</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS:  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers%3A_A_Tale_of_Two_Sons'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers%3A_A_Tale_of_Two_Sons</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I wanna get it, but my laptop wouldn't be able to play it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I/they might need to flesh out the idea of the zelda co-op so it doesn't feel like an escort mission. As I said, I'd like to see them both be useful, and maybe even have similar enough abilities and equipment. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and not to rag on the damsel trope, but maybe at least link or zelda doesn't get kidnapped? Maybe someone else, but c'mon, give zelda a break. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDR</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#c1bb10">CURRENT courageousScribe [CCS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: majoras mask\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: is all i have to say to that\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yes! :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: majora's mask didn't have that :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I like majora's mask a lot :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: In an interview like, a year ago they ʃaid Zelda Wii U waʃ going to be a near complete divorce from the traditional formula</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: it's even difficult, somewhat :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though tehnically zelda was only really in like, one cutscene ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'd like a game with zelda still in it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but not the damsel :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CZC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: maybe even she's the hero :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I juʃt want to ʃee ʃomething different</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: same :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: like, non-ʃequential dungeonʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: iʃ ʃomething i'd love</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: with the legend of zelda co-op idea, what I think I'd like to see is if a enemy tries to attack link, zelda can perform a counter attack or block/defend link :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and link can do the same :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: alʃo, no more Foreʃt, Fire, Water trinity.  Do ʃome bloody dungeonʃ that actually reflect what thoʃe are ʃuppoʃed to repreʃent, which iʃ Courage, Power, and Wiʃdom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so it's like, they're realy working together. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: courage could be a really scary temple :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: wisdom could be lots of puzzles :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and power... :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: hm... :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: lotʃ of fighting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sorta how in skyward sword they had the minisections for those sorta things while going after the triforce? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I haven't played skyward sword, unfortunately :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: ʃorta, they didn't even get it right there either</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was a start ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: What if for once they had Ganon not be the main villain in a conʃole Zelda.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ΘH GΘD NΘW I REMEMBER THE 2ILENT RE▲LM2</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog, that place ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like how Twilight Princeʃʃ ʃould of been</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: *FL▲2HB▲CK*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ohgosh</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, Zant was nearly the main villain until ganon took over :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: *FET▲L PΘ2ITIΘN*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: and then they juʃt ʃcrewed Zant'ʃ character over</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I liked the bosses in twilight princess :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like, he waʃ creepy aʃ ʃit, but then, wooky wooky kooky</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I don't like how he ju5t...explode5</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: DO NOT TAKE MIRROR ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: god there'ʃ ʃo many thingʃ i'd change if i rewrote the primary Zelda gameʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Same :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ...5peaking of TP I need to fini5h that game I never got pa5t the fir5t dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: orz</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I really like the series, but like Doctor Who, I can see where it could be a lot better. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like, I like the idea of Twilight Princeʃʃ, but what they originally preʃented in the firʃt trailer</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: omg</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: i'd love that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like, the Twilight Realm waʃ originally black and white, like all the life had been ʃucked out of the world</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I liked the open worldness of wind waker :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I never got to play windwaker :C</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: maybe keep the maturity of twilight princess, and have the open world of wind waker :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And then :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I heard an HD remake is coming out ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I still like my co-op of Link and Zelda idea :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, the remake's for Wii U :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: for WiiU which I do not own .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'd like to see the HD remake for 3DS :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I know they have the technology :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: where they can put it on there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Actually, the ʃtuff they've done to Wind Waker wouldn't run on the 3Dʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: all the crazy dynamic ʃadowʃ and ʃit iʃ a bit much for it.  Like, the ʃunʃetʃ reflect realiʃtic natural lighting now</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm trying to think of an example of a co-op similar to what I'm thinking of for the link and zelda thing :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: not saying they would be a couple, but you know the battle couple trope, SS? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's kind of like, they'd be fighting together and adventuring together and side by side :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: there's a few problems with my idea :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but it might be interesting to think of :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: i think it'd be intereʃting to have 3 characterʃ....but that'ʃ juʃt me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: like, a Wiʃdom, Courage, and Power character</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ooh :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so like :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: legend of zelda, but with a party? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: would be a great way to get Ganon out of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Yeah, ʃorta</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: kind of seems like more of an action rpg :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but it could be a good idea :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: The problem iʃ trying to figure out a way to make Courage mechanically diʃtinct from the otherʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: like, Courage iʃ Courage.</span><br />
