[07:29:40] We've come too far to give up who we are<br />
[07:30:04] So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars<br />
[07:30:34] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ *Was distracted for a minute there* Yeah there were one or two instances of players having a spat ooc in scode and while generally it settled down ok that instance was particularly bad Σ</span><br />
[07:31:16] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: There was a GM defending the person who was clearly out of line.</span><br />
[07:31:18] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I just get annoyed when everyone outside of the arg sterotyped scode as nothing but drama and wrote it off as crap. :/ Σ</span><br />
[07:31:42] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Cherie wasn't really a gm Σ</span><br />
[07:32:10] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Wasn't she listed at the end as such?</span><br />
[07:32:27] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As one of the people who helped make the puzzles Σ</span><br />
[07:32:48] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: oh</span><br />
[07:33:54] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Still she felt like she had to defend her because "PM was attacking HAFG"??</span><br />
[07:34:15] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Sorry it's just an old sore spot for me</span><br />
[07:35:26] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Well to be fair, it was mainly an issue of miscommunication and bad blood between two specific players about something outside of the game that caused this Σ</span><br />
[07:35:51] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ They just used this as an excuse and then people jumped in without knowing what was going on Σ</span><br />
[07:36:18] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: all we knew was that PM was getting anon hate</span><br />
[07:37:25] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ If I remember correctly from my conversations with PM and the other person about the issue it started with some other stuff entirely and the led to the anon hate as they passive-agressively went after each other Σ</span><br />
[07:38:10] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ neither side was right (especially the one who sent teh anon hate) and I made sure to talk with them about how that wouldn't be tollerated in teh arg Σ</span><br />
[07:38:12] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ the* Σ</span><br />
[07:38:34] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: And we've never seen PM again...</span><br />
