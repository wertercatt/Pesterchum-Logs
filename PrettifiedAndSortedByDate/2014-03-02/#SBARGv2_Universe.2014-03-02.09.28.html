<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...do you think the trees effects are magical, or memetic in effect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: considering Kat, more likely magical.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I got us a plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, we need you to set up a containment field around the entire tree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...plus, I actually saw my HP dropping a bit while we were near the tree...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, that was the plan for when you were talking "nuke it from orbit" so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I mean instead of containing an /explosion/... we contain the tree!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also what about Rob and AD? they're both still at the tree, and if I put the field up now they'll be locked in until I get close enough to portal them out...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Rob, can you get them out of there?</span><br />

<span style="color:#716604">CNL: why should i really care</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If the tree is draining our life, it shouldn't have an effect on robots.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: LIfe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought it was your soul it drained, or is this deviating from the source material?</span><br />

<span style="color:#716604">CNL: i dont know what either of those things are FL, nor do I care</span><br />
