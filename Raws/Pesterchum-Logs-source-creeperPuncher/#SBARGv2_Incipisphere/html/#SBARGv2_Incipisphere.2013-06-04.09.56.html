<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, so the pumpkin code can be laserstationed if you get the captcha card in the machine fast enough...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean "!Pumpkin"? wow, why didn't I think of that in the *woof* first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still, how to get a pumpkin to begin with</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Simple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We wait until the period of time they stop vanishing.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now we just need to stay alive for almost 5 months...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but didn't we already get a bunch of pumpkins from last halloween already?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't think we still have them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either way, we need to wait for one thing or another.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Yeah, but they're already gone. Bakagami's code-hacking machine ate them all as fuel, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I mean like, they'd wind up paradoxifying or something if we went back to get them</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: To think of it if we did go back and paradoxify them that'd be a pretty good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It might make them more stable and immune to the paradox's Chronos could throw at us</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...do ghost images stay stable?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...guys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, not really. remember when Jade first started using the Pictionary Modus?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ghost images tend to explode</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, better questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: question*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait here's an idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We put the slime in like, bullets or some shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How LONG do ghost images of pumpkins last?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Until the laws of physics kick in </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So all of a second maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: about as long as the pumpkins themselves do; a minimum of one panel and a max of when Paradox Space notices them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So we need to wait until october, or make some sort of quantum superposition weapon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Or, like I said, send a Time Player back to captcharoid and WRITE DOWN the code for a pumpkin from last Halloween...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As Pumpkins exist in a quantum superposition, the opposite would likely be an object that is held together from quantum effects...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like SCP-682 after the test with SCP-536.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I think I've managed to enhance my Gravity Dislocator.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It should be able to contain massive ammounts of gravity in a field now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we can for example, drop a black hole on chronos then contain it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Either that, or we try a void+time or time+void fraymotif on him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Lock him in time or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What about a Void+Void+Time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: How about just Void+Void+Void and remove him from existance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that aspect powers can double up in this session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think it would be that easy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: question is, how does aspect damage typing work in this game? can Time affect Time, or Breath versus Breath?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, there is a chance that he has managed to capture another aspect for himself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or are they all self-immune?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But from the way the aspects line up, the only extra aspect he could have... is void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, Worse case scenario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I do know some aspects are opposites, like Light and Void...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He has Space, Time, AND Void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so if he is a Douche of Space and Time AND Void, I'd deal *and* recieve automatic Super Effective against him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We can't let him into another session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we do, he may have four aspects then, and we won</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 't be able to stop him them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, lets see, what are our current plans?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1. Drop him into a black hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2. Window intersection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3. ANTIMATTER.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 4. Everything that is on the not to alchemize list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How about the fabled time/space punch</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: doesn't that only dislocate and not remove?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 5. Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was thinking more of the Ark Gurren's punch</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But Super Tengen could definitely work better</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What happens when you do the Ark Gurrens punch with Super Tengen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You punch straight outside of the known universe</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...define the plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: All we need to do is get a fraymotif that involves every single person in the session as a combo move</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And then we'll be able to make Super Tengen Toppa Sbarg Lagann</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...problem. thats impossible. some of the people in this session are perma-dead.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Ya kay, SV?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...however, for the people that WERE jerks... well, I still feel bad. They didn't deserve /that/.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's just drop the subject, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, where are we gonna get pumpkins?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what pumpkins</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I swear to god if another person makes that Joke I will smash a pumpkin on there head when I can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we could try stealing them from Chronos a couple months ago before they ran out, but then he'd probably pull that "I see you" thing and take us out then and there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would be best to wait about 5 months.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...I was completly serious, FL. what pumpkins.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: You know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We could do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We would not even make a paradox with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, we are planning to use binary not on pumpkins so he can't wipe us from time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Just think about it. we notify our past selves about this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Thats not the only thing we have to be worried about, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then we fuck over this timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And slay chronos when he was still weak, or we run the guardian release code earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SV, we are not doing this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would DIE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, get wiped from existance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Had a bad thought earlier, about what FL is doing with the code.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL =/= Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I misspelled. sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The best plan is to tell our past selves to send us the code, saying we need the pumpkin for shinanigans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And tell them NOTHING ELSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, this needs to be a forgetful person...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a person who remembers giving the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or we hop about 5 months into the future and grab the code for a pumpkin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Anyways, why did Cronos need the codes relating to aspects?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH GOD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Indeed.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: At least, according to the storybook I have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But if he were to get every classpect... It would be like that one fanfic that the guy turned into lord english... before we knew who he was, of course.</span><br />
