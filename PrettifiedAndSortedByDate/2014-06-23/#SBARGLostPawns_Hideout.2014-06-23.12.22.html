[12:25:13] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  is on the surface of the meteor. --</span><br />

[13:40:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#000000">[CBH]</span>  wakes up on the floor an empty booze jug in one hand --</span><br />
[13:40:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: HOLY SHIT</span><br />
[13:40:19] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: WE GOT THE FUY</span><br />
[13:40:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: *GUY</span><br />
[13:40:47] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ........????????</span><br />
[13:41:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: EF</span><br />
[13:41:19] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  climbs down the ladder. --</span><br />
[13:41:41] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Shit, you guys had booze and didn- WAIT, I CAN'T DRINK IT.</span><br />
[13:41:45] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: D:&lt;</span><br />
[13:41:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we cauhgt a serial killer who may or may not be past Chronos</span><br />
[13:42:15] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...curse my habit of falling asleep at a regular time...</span><br />
[13:42:27] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: also hey, I can't drink alcohol either.</span><br />
[13:42:32] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: dude, it was really anticlimactic</span><br />
[13:42:37] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: he showed up</span><br />
[13:42:38] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: stabbed me</span><br />
[13:42:46] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I caught him with my scissor swords</span><br />
[13:42:53] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: then PK got behind him with claws</span><br />
[13:42:54] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the end</span><br />
[13:43:07] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: welp</span><br />
[13:43:20] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I punched him</span><br />
[13:43:24] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: he fell onto those claws</span><br />
[13:43:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: STARTED bleeding out</span><br />
[13:43:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: only to have his aspect powers revoked</span><br />
[13:43:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and have his unconcious body stuffed in a bear cage</span><br />
[13:44:13] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...wait, aspect powers revoked?</span><br />
[13:44:20] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: You cut off the flow to his powers?</span><br />
[13:44:26] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: yeah, we got this cool little choker thing</span><br />
[13:44:27] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Thats... oh my.</span><br />
[13:44:32] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that keeps him from using his powers</span><br />
[13:44:36] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...huh.</span><br />
[13:44:45] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:44:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT stealthyCalligrapher <span style="color:#688e2e">[CSC]</span>  looks around for the guy, obviously failing to find them because offline --</span><br />
[13:45:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Must be a doomed timeclone, the real chronos wouldn't just have his powers revoked just like that.</span><br />
[13:45:36] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( THE IRONY OF THAT STATEMENT ))</span><br />
[13:45:57] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or we just caused a time paradox</span><br />
[13:46:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and therefore shouldn't exist</span><br />
[13:46:17] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or atleas</span><br />
[13:46:19] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Either way, he still would be doomed.</span><br />
[13:46:20] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: *atleast</span><br />
[13:46:27] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if he doesn't fuck shit up in our session</span><br />
[13:46:38] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we'll have a paradox</span><br />
[13:46:44] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I guess what the point is that we may or may not be doomed ourself.</span><br />
[13:46:59] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: didn't think about that</span><br />
[13:47:10] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: makes sense, kind of</span><br />
[13:47:29] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  looks like this by the way: <a href='http://i.imgur.com/MRvOwKC.png'>http://i.imgur.com/MRvOwKC.png</a> --</span><br />
[13:47:53] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: I'm... fairly sure we're /not/ doomed, at least in a timeline sense.</span><br />
[13:48:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: for the record we're not even sure its Chronos</span><br />
[13:48:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i'm just pulling at straws</span><br />
[13:48:24] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: sense he's a time player</span><br />
[13:48:29] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: he's a serial killer</span><br />
[13:48:32] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: GT revival tends to malfunction or be outright disabled in doomed timelines, or so I've heard... and several of us have respawned fine lately.</span><br />
[13:48:38] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and he pleaded the fifth on being on his way to another session</span><br />
[13:49:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Lets just shoot him in the head and see if he dies a just death.</span><br />
[13:49:18] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: nah</span><br />
[13:49:20] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if he does do that</span><br />
[13:49:25] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and it is Chronos</span><br />
[13:49:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: shit is gonna get fucked</span><br />
[13:49:31] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:49:42] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: So you would rather /let him go/?!</span><br />
[13:49:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we need to figure out a way to keep shit from getting fucked</span><br />
[13:50:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: without letting him fuck with our shit</span><br />
[13:50:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I think finding a time player would be key</span><br />
[13:50:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Okay, here is the plan.</span><br />
[13:50:45] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but as it stands, I don't think we should risk killing him</span><br />
[13:50:49] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: We have a time player on the sidelines, and if we start dying after we shoot him in the head, he goes back to stop us.</span><br />
[13:51:08] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: yeah</span><br />
[13:51:15] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or we find some way to rewrite history</span><br />
[13:51:19] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so that when we kill him</span><br />
[13:51:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if its Chronos</span><br />
[13:51:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: a paradox won't occur</span><br />
[13:51:49] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...actually, that's impossible.</span><br />
[13:52:05] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: the entire Post-Scratch session depends on him existing.</span><br />
[13:52:39] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: KICK LOGIC AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE</span><br />
[13:52:41] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: and things that are depended on for a session to happen tend to be the stickier Fixed Points In Time...</span><br />
[13:52:48] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: THAT'S HOW TEAM DAI GURREN ROLLS</span><br />
[13:52:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: So its either a doomed version, or we throw him into space and /fly away/ while he is tied up and bound.</span><br />
[13:53:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so then</span><br />
[13:53:20] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: eh, also true</span><br />
[13:53:23] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: do we let him fuck our session up?</span><br />
[13:53:27] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: wait</span><br />
[13:53:43] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but if that's what he meant when he said we'd eventually have to die</span><br />
[13:53:52] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: why did he stab me last night?</span><br />
[13:54:00] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I seriously doubt it was just because I provoked him.</span><br />
[13:55:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Lets find a time player and rock paper scissors to decide who shoots him in the head.</span><br />
[13:55:46] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: yeah</span><br />
[13:56:03] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: shit</span><br />
[13:56:07] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: now that I think about it</span><br />
[13:56:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what if this is part of a paradox that already occured</span><br />
[13:56:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and this is just some kind of repeat of the events that unfolded as a result of it</span><br />
[13:58:54] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: anyway</span><br />
[13:58:57] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we got him</span><br />
[13:59:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so that's cool</span><br />
[13:59:47] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we also started discussing ways to get a better ISP</span><br />
[14:00:53] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: welp</span><br />
[14:00:58] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ima start cooking breakfast</span><br />
[14:01:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
[14:01:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  reopens the pocket kitch: cabinets, stoves, and a regrigerator fold out of its little disc form --</span><br />
[14:02:56] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: This... doesn't add up...</span><br />
[14:03:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  rumages through the fridge and pulls out bacon and pulls out the ingredients for crepes --</span><br />
[14:03:13] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: waht do you mean?</span><br />
[14:03:41] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: It just... doesn't.</span><br />
[14:03:58] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: The Chronos theory? Well then maybe it just isn't him.</span><br />
[14:04:00] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: again</span><br />
[14:04:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I was pulling at straws</span><br />
[14:04:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and pleading the fifth on trying to enter another session is a pretty long straw to pick at</span><br />
[14:04:47] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  blender noises --</span><br />
[14:07:56] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well, lets see just how much he goes insane when he sees my face.</span><br />
[14:08:04] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...</span><br />
[14:08:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: yo, sausage or bacon?</span><br />
[14:10:39] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: why not both?</span><br />
[14:10:50] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I guess we could do that</span><br />
[14:11:00] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ((speaking of, afklunch))</span><br />
[14:11:18] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  grabs the pan then closes and reopens to grab an identical pan --</span><br />
[14:13:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  throws mini-link sausages in one pan and bacon in the other --</span><br />
[14:13:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  walks away --</span><br />
[14:19:49] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ((back))</span><br />
[14:20:27] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  goes back to the stove --</span><br />
[14:21:03] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so anyway, I was going to set up a no-snow-zone on the planet at some point</span><br />
[14:22:32] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( thats gonna be hilarious to see ))</span><br />
[14:23:19] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: are there any imps on that planet?</span><br />
[14:23:47] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: All skeletal.</span><br />
[14:24:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: wait so they're dead, or...</span><br />
[14:24:12] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: That goes for all of the underlings on the land, I'm afraid.</span><br />
[14:24:18] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well, that I've seen.</span><br />
[14:24:23] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: shit</span><br />
[14:24:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I wanted to kill things</span><br />
[14:33:51] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well, you can kill them as much as you can kill undead, I suppose.</span><br />
[14:34:03] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what so they're moving around?</span><br />
[14:34:08] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
[14:34:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that changes everything</span><br />
[14:34:17] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And they are /really fucking hard to take down/</span><br />
[14:36:54] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: have you guys thought about building on the surface of the meteor at all?</span><br />
[14:42:39] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Too easy for underlings bigger than an imp to assalt the interior.</span><br />
[14:42:47] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I mean, the surface.</span><br />
[14:42:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Only Imps can really get to the interior.</span><br />
[14:43:10] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: wait there are underlings on this rock</span><br />
[14:43:20] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ?</span><br />
[14:43:30] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Underlings are really good at climbing, it seems.</span><br />
[14:44:05] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what are they climbing</span><br />
[14:45:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Up the side of the meteor... which is only the point where gravity is still stronger torwards the land.</span><br />
[14:45:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but how are they getting up here?</span><br />
[14:45:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what exactly are they climbing</span><br />
[14:45:54] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: The rocky surface of the meteor.</span><br />
[14:45:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: to get to the meteor itself</span><br />
[14:46:14] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: The meteor is literally touching the land.</span><br />
[14:46:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ...</span><br />
[14:46:24] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: huh</span><br />

[14:47:00] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I MEAN, THE METEOR IS PRETTY BIG BUT YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT</span><br />
[14:47:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I'M NOT EVEN SURE</span><br />
[14:49:00] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: oh foods ready</span><br />
