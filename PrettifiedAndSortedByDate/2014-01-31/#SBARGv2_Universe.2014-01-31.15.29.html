[06:19:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Inside of the temple should be a giant flower with a timer on the pedestal it rests on.</span><br />

[06:24:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I highly recommend that the information inscribed on those walls does not make it off that planet... but It has likely gotten off it already.</span><br />
