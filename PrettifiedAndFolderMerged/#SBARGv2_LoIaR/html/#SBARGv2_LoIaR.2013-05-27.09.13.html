<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: probabely</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I've heard that the selling price of things is based on both the functional value (Russian Bob-Ombs love getting bassa-boom drunk) and grist cost (so if Artifact is selling for a lot, that SBaHJifier just turned into a boonbond printing press!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: That would make since</span><br />
