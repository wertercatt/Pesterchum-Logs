<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I took down my first ogre... for real.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That "safety program" prevented the server from taking it off the tower... so I improvised.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :O?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With stabbing it through a weak point in the base of its neck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Took a bit of damage until I was able to get up there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But It all payed off. Then I made my way though the gate and spawned on a MOVING TRAIN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sometime I think this game hates me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seems to hate a lot of people sometimes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like dwarf fortress.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except with better graphics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, maybe not that much, but pretty darn close.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It could be worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: have I told you about all the times I've fallen into these holes on my land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, you haven't</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I've managed to find this black fire... It seems to draw energy torwards it, cooling everything in its radius.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wierd. o_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I had to run alot afterward.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Freaking traps...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I've made a code, it might be worth while... hold on as I switch modu- IMPS.</span><br />
