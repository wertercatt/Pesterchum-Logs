<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 11. The fact that 682 was /even able to be spawned/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: no one should really care about 3. It, like you said, doesn't have anything to do with us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 6 sounds like something you're aware of and should probably work on as it's kiiinda a problem only you can fix.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "you are going to be forevver alone"</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Its a challenge. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Just because you tend to "go rogue" and do your own thing doesn't mean you can't have friends. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Roxy for example is very close to her friends. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /riiiight./</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ You really don't. You are not just a Rogue of Heart. You are a person with your own thoughts and desires. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: ...Man, I wish something would happen. Like that old dude coming back.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Twice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, doing the heart to heart atleast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Huh... Let Me Guess. Scared?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm not Heart is difficult to quantify. Like Mind it is one of the "personal" Aspects (in contrast to say Blood and Breath which are social and Rage and Hope which are emotional) Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you knew what the inside of my heart looked like right now... well, I cant use it to help me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Why Not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Heart is the defining aspect of a person. Its the 'inner' verses Mind's 'outer'. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I am worried that anyone I got to help me would get trapped inside of me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So Heart is the aspect of the soul, the definition of things, the 'heart' of the matter, and indentity itself. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The soul is the defining aspect of humanity. Its their identity and their core self that they hide from the world within their consciousness. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Sure you can steal souls but more importantly you are the one who can dig deeper into the inner selves of others and bring their true selves to light. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ When you steal something you reveal it, which is a part of your nature as outlined by the classpect. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: *he</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As an example, Mind is the 'outer' aspect of a person meaning its the thoughts, choices, and the facades/mental walls we put around our Heart to defend ourselves. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So as a Prince of Mind I've realized that I am very very good at piercing right through those facades and getting to the Heart of the matter. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You tell me I should be independent, and well, I'm concerned about what alot of people think about me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ But that is not just /because/ I am a Prince of Mind, its just who I am. The title just highlighted that. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Then ask for them to tell you truthfully.  Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Its often better to act and find out than to wallow in indecision. Σ</span><br />
