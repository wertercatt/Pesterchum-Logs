[04:35:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: last night you were attempting to bring a dormant character back into use when you already have a handful that take turns being active. That being said, I did everything I could ICly possible to prevent having to be the one responsable for said reactivation. Now, I realize you want to follow the reason behind said actions and take it all back, but that would be unfair to those who have participated in the &lt;</span><br />
[04:35:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">event last night, because frankly: it's rare that any reactionary type stuff even happens very often and it probably added some character development that shouldn't be removed for the sake of fixing a mistake which has already been made. Thereare ways without retcons that you can deactivate AC or limit the use of your alts (a possible headcanon: some of the swap-out characters could very well be the same person</span><br />
[04:35:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">ICly wearing a variety of disguises) ➜</span><br />

[04:36:19] <span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: because i'm scared of GMing it</span><br />

[04:36:46] <span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: so no character dev even happend</span><br />
[04:37:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I PM'd CP and EQ during the event for advice, and fluffy asked to be apart of the shenanigans as well. ➜</span><br />

[04:39:00] <span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: you've all said that on multiple occassions</span><br />
[04:39:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's the way you pull them off that's kinda shakey ➜</span><br />
[04:39:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that thing one of your chars did last night with the pig seems to serve as a perfect analogy for your modus operendi. ➜</span><br />
[04:40:05] <span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: modus operendi?</span><br />
[04:40:37] <span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: oh I see</span><br />
[04:42:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first: you bring something in that hasn't been confirmed to be a thing, second: you try to get others to go with your plot plan, thridly:other attempt to let you know about your logical falicies, forthly: you wind up breaking down and destroying the thing you were working on, most likely out of shame, as if it had no impact on things. ➜</span><br />
[04:43:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (can somebody please tell me if I'm being irrational here? I'm starting to feel like I'm being too biased) ➜</span><br />

[04:45:53] <span style="color:#00b6b6">CBH: not a thing</span><br />
