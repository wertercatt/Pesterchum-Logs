<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: &gt;international waters ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This is an interesting conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Wouldn't that just be evasion of law?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#225604">CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: guys what do i do</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what happened? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not even a citizen of Neon or PA's Empyre.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: too bad the door blocked carapacians, we could use an Authority Regulator's opinion on this case... also what</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: gramps is leaving our house for eight hours a day every day</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and we don't know why</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: because he usually lives a pretty sedimentary lifestyle</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: There are Carapacians in Neon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Bet hes playing childrens card games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...uhhh ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( SJ? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: ((shit, forgot about that rule))</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: no, he'd be taking dad to locals with him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( been claimed before ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( no objects so far ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Perhaps it would be most conveniant to your pursuit of knowledge to follow him</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((that's because "those who write the rules" aren't even on most of the time and I keep forgetting too many rules))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and I forget to enforce them....))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and now the skypers are gonna complain again...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Laws only tend to work when a majority of people follow them... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((even though half of them don't even RP here anymore))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((maybe let it slide by the loophole of Voidy shenans that didn't /technically/ go through the door?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((because they're sick of the over-the-top shenanigans))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((red!CP, no, they'll get mad))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Maybe we can just retcon the Carapace thing, since they can normally be exiles anyway? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( they are merely residents of the city. no shenans ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sigh... I dunno then. but... "what they don't know won't hurt them".))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((this is why I REALLY WISH there was someone as picky as them that actually cared))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I mean, they wouldn't have the rings since both of those have likely been taken care of off screen. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( what about the consorts? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so as long as we don't tell them, and don't mention anything on the one day every other week Ash is in the memos, we're fine.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((but unmentioned things eventually make it into plot which make it onto the front page))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and consorts were brought through the door just fine. one of the moons is a consort nation.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((consorts are fine))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Consorts were let through because Nak. If we had had a Caraspace player due to shenigains, those would likely be here as well. So other than player favortism... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //really wants to play the "if you don't care enough to be around anymore, don't enforce arbitrary rules by proxy" card... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((kimura, maybe you should explain the case to them))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((*Red!CP))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake!OOC <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL!OOC]</span>  is wondering if he can play it instead. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((like, considfering they listen to you most of the time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (("Kimura" does toast me, yes. "Kim" doesn't, but maybe I should set it as a toast too))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and shrug))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I keep forgetting Kimura is your IC name))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and it's improper to use a character's name when addressing the mun))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((and while you guys do a rule debate, I'm making disney donate to unicef))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((at least I'm assuming so))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Except most of our names match ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I go by Kimura oocly too, at least online.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: ((his name's Wacko McGoose))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( and in the cases they don't, adding "mun" to the end usually works. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: ((This is his actual name.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((:b))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Megamaw, seriously? :P))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  //is a useless piece of trash who doesn't know what she's doing --</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I mean mostly in the case of sounmding unnessisarily bossy while getting nothing done))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((like, I'm clearly only trying to enforce rules for the sake of those who technically shouldn't even care))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((all because I've been getting stressed out over the constant criticism))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((which can only be fixed when guidelines are followed correctly))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((that way they can be yelled at back about the rules actualy being followed, even if if doesn't acutally make enough sense for them))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((is any of this making any sense?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: (9up until the last part for me))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah, sort of.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it all ends up being "who's higher leveled in rules-lawyering".))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((does anyone remember when FA tryed to call BS when I tryed to use a cube of frozen macaroni?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........only in the vaguest sense possible))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( what the heck? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I wound up being able to defend it with the player sheet which had a not only an item list, but a wherabouts history/inventory history))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((damn girl))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( sometimes it feels like the RP is a mini tumblr. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((you Pheonix Wrighted/Dangan Ronpaed it SJ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Harvey Birdman :V</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah, that's pretty much how it went))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and the mini-tumblr thing probably comes from the fact that the blogs within v2 canon are tumblr-based))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((which attracts more tumblr folk))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that's what I was thinking too))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((it doesn't feel nearly as distinctly tumblry as the IRIS/ZDK11 fandom though))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( As it goes on, its less fandom stuff but more... toxic. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( :&lt; ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Which is like the opposite of what it should be. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah......))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((one can not run a tyranny on the internet...one can also not try to rules something you have no proper presence in...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((sorta why I wanted the grist thing to take of, but it had no IC justification nor anyone fulfilling/giving requests))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Maybe we could do some sort of game thing. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((*off))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((what sorta game thing?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well I was planning on doing SBURBcraft kinda IC due to a mini plot which is hunting down a Virus in the AU Machine by collecting pieces of data. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((the platformer porject can always use assistance, considering it will definately take more than a year to complete development of even just the basic plot-important levels.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((*project))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((oh, you meant multiplayer IC game events))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, the only request in v2grist is from a player that is... removed. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( i dont have minecraft :T ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah... it's hard to do anything when there aren't any current player requests...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And too many people feel like it would be a dick move to ask for things while not being able to do anything in return. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so... anything going on right now? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: (9player...requests?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I am still studying and hacking</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((requests by players))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((or others involved who have blogs))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((may i request that those who don't play shut up?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((/that/ is a thing that is true, CS.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((um, AS, do you know how grist went in v1?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((nah, go ahead and call me AS if ya want. It's kind of obvious ain't it?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((nope, does it have anything to do with my request of less anger and bossiness?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((not really, it's more artwork/some other sort of content request-based and occasinally acts of kindness))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: (( oook? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((then again, i'm not even sure if it can even be called grist anymore, considering there are no ways to earn grist during the postgame))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I really feel like somebody else could explain it a lot better than I can...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((...darn it, I killed it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((nope))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((laydough))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I think I'm gonna get going, it's getting a little late at the library today.))</span><br />
