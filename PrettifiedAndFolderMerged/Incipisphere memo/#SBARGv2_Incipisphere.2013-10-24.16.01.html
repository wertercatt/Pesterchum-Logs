<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh, theyre consorts!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: it's not like he's a Player Killer, we don't need to kill him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: then i guess its fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I have only killed... three consorts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: intentionally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One was an accident, the second was a scorpion, and the third was that bee.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: how about the ones caught in your various new and creative nukes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The scorpions tried to kill us first, yo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: how about the ones on the land you flooded?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You know what I have never actually heard of a life hero being able to ~feel~ life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...what even /are/ PK's consorts anyway? don't think I've ever seen them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Death toll from that first one was zero, and the water from the splash damage normally /despawns after three seconds/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, all life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but it didnt</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it didnt despawn, and people died</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like legit I kill thousands too</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably have stepped on more than my fair share of bugs</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: underlings arent really "alive" by game rules</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If your ship exploded right now, and every consort on your land died, would it be your fault? Would you be responsible for something which would obviously /never happen in any sane moment?/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I did /tests/ on the splash damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It /always/ despawned after three seconds during those tests.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This conversation is so stupid I'm going to go hang out with like Empy or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if i were using a ship with an unstable nuclear core, and tried to charge someone with it? even if i tested the core beforehand and was /sure/ it would work?</span><br />
