[06:55] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: if its not to much trouble could you add me back to the official one, and add me to Ben's if he's okay with that.</span><br />

[07:01] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: stupid mobile app</span><br />
[07:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I tried adding you, but you weren't in the "add people" list even after I accepted your contact request, and then looking at the userlist you're still there</span><br />
[07:02] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Lemme kill the app, brb</span><br />

[07:23] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I know but I'm not in the memo on my side.</span><br />
[07:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, the way skype memos work is, if you're signed in, you're in all of the ones you have access to, even if you're only looking at the homepage</span><br />
[07:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: to "leave" a memo without being kicked from it, you have to close the app entirely</span><br />
[07:26] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I might be in the memo but its not registering on the app that I am, I left like on Saturday.</span><br />
[07:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, I'll kick and re-add then</span><br />
