<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … On the Euclidean plane, it's impossible. An internal angle is 3pi/5 and not a divisor of 2pi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: well...maybe the entire floor was based off of five sided tiles</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "standard" pentagons can't tile. but if they're distorted into, say, a house shape (still five sides technically), they would tile.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, pentagons that aren't equilateral can tile fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: if you've ever layed down tile you'd know you could pretty easily do five sided tiles</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Okay, its just they were perfect, same length on everyside..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: The magicant is /weird/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then they shouldn't be able to tile in a Euclid-- OH</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The /Magicant/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and you're just figuring that out now, DJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, non-Euclidean geometry functions there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: FL has me on a mapping project, he says he will help later, but yeah, the magicant /is/ pretty messed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Also, my camera exploded when I tried to take a picture.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: snrk</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: /sigh/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Euclidean is "normal" geometry. How things fit right here. Non-Euclidean is when you have hyperbolic planes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: bloic*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: bolic*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: To quote directly from Wikipedia about this, as it words it better than I do, the difference between the geometries is as follows...</span><br />
AG: "The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement that, in two-dimensional space, for any given line R and point P not on R, there is exactly one line through P that does not intersect R; i.e., that is parallel to R. In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through P which do not intersect R, so the parallel postulate is false."<br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … More than one line can go through the same space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Oh, okay!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't know how to explain it to you really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The Magicant is just spacefucked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: It looks kinda normal to me, but its weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Its kinda wavy.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You could have at /least/ taken the coins on the other side of the stairs.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you can lengthen and shorten lives yo</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...huh?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: CP, what was it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: time prince over here, totally willing to help out ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think we have different interpretaations</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: two brush-technique scrolls and a bunch of thingies I can apparently use to alchemize my max-level weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what i mean is, like Feferi [as a witch of life] could extend the mayor's life</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TT could shorten Chronos'</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hm..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the scrolls are for Luckrise, which concentrates luck in an area, and Luckset, which disperses luck from an area.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True. In theory, TT could shorten chronos' life to almost nothing. But ending life, however, is more along the lines of destruction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and considering I still don't have that many aspect-manipulation skills, I'll take anything I can find :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'd disagree</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm wondering what I could try to do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the destruction of life would be something more serious</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like you had the option before you to provide fresh clean water to starving men</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and you instead destroy the device that would make the water</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: thusly destroying their life</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: in this case we are not destroying life,</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we would be using her abilities to reduce it to nothing. the difference being that you instead ration the water so that they wither away to nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: make sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, pretty much lower to lw enough so that it's extremely easy to take him down? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hmph... dark way of putting it, but I can see your point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Interesting...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: but if it is reduced to nothing, b<span style="color:#730e8f">y that logic wouldn't it be destroyed?</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the men still lay there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: I mean, what <span style="color:#730e8f">else would it be?</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: with her powers we could likely revive him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: maybe iτ's like a "reduce τo minimal HP" τhing</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: or someτhing</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what i mean is, as we've seen, destruction is the drastic removal of something so that it cannot be regained.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((EQ, what time would the "Athens run" on the pir8pad be at? I won't be home until 4pm PST tomorrow, but saturday's clear for me...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a man who is starving and dying of thirst may be on the edge of death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...sounds like that describes it well...reducing max HP...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but he is not dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he can still be given these things</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but all it would take from there is just a little bit to push them over the edge</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but you take away his ability to gain what he needs to survive, and he is all but alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((I'll see when. Hopefully, around 4 tomarrow, if I get home around then. If not, and if saturday is free for me, then whenever i get up then I guess :P ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: now</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so it was already planned afternoon-ways, cool))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i don't know what she can do with her god-tier powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: could be reduce to low health</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: could be outright kill him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but the point is, if we had a Prince of Life use their powers to kill him then there would be no life to ever return</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if a Witch used their powers, their life are reduced to something so small that they simply</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wither</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but the witch maintains the option to do the opposite</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: to supplement and allow it to grow</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wither, or just flick them in the face to push them that one last heart point and ded.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the Prince destroys without any remains</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: something new must take it's place. the Witch manipulates, adds or subtracts, but maintains this basic control</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah, like spreading out a bit of clay so thin that it's hardly noticable. It's still there, so the witch could just reform the clay back if needed, and its not outright gone. Just not noticable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so there's my aspect and class rant for the night i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: yeah..</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: All right then, yeah. That certianly sounds right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cool. thanks for letting me elaborate, too</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: :)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: most people are a little stiff with this kind of thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ono</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh. Speculation/debation on these sort of topics is harmless and fun, in my opinion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'd like to do some research on my classpect and see what I could do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Mage of Breath?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -TT why the " ono " ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft. I just thought of a way to make Chronos have an Ironic Death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Rogue of Breath...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Kat reduces his max HP to one, I draw Luckset on him to drain his luck, he trips over his own tentacle for 1HP damage, boom.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Maybe I could try something with that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: in a combative sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you'd rob your opponents breath to lend it to your allies</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so, within reason, you're a "support" class</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i suppose, what with your combination</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Does Chronos even breathe?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Isn't he made up of black tar goop?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well breath is a wide term</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you can steal determination from a person/being and lend it to your allies, as breath is the willingness to continue forwards no matter how bleak it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and we all know how determined Chronos is</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so you could plausibly leave him feeling drained</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, that lends into this fray I have...</span><br />
