<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, so lemme see if I got the main points of that log: jury's still out on AC's shenans, Denizens are NOPE, Carapaces are ALSO NOPE unless we encounter a planet in the universe that has already had its own session, I was one of the more obvious canon-stretchers but did it in a way that was 0kay, Cherubs are either played by a GM or Not Happening, trolls are shrug, no phallic ships, angler fish are disturbing, Exotic Matter plus Coal equals FTL, and communicating outside of v2 (random encounters and tumblr RPing) can be /mentioned/ in the pchum side of things, but should only actually take place in tumblr.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: denizen shenanigans mostly. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I was a little out there but I like to think I still kept the spirit of a Denizen in place with Dae. Or at least my interpretation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what I'm guessing for my own canon-breaking was the whole plot about Crump and Doopliss trying to take over Cetus' role?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and i think your use of self-prototyping?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh, thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It was...Interesting. Truth be told one of my biggest sources of contention thorough v2 was the tendancy to rip entire dungeons, enemies and items from whatever game/show of choice for the person in paticular. CP at least wrapped it up in a quasi-original plot that just so happened to borrow things so </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but the point still stands that there was technical ripping off which encouraged others to do the same apparently. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not his falt everybody else was a bunch of uncreative shits</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah it's not his fault you're an uncreative </span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really feel like I droppped the ball on my land quest. Mine didn't even really have a story because SV offered to take it over and ended the plot too early. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i ended it too early because reckoning</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, he made me fight my denizen jst days after the 4th gate opened up. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If I'd known v2 was gonna go on for so long I might not've wrapped things up so early on, but, alas</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i killed amy too early too</span><br />
