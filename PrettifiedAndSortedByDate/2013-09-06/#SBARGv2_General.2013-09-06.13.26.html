<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Okay I realized halfway through you're probably talking about anime in general which</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /might/ or might not be justified</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I dislike generalizations in general.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but it doesnt even try to play with or subvert any of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its just by-the-book anime</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: RWBY you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the only thing that sets it apart is that the guys from rooster  teeth made it and its all in shitty mmd cgi</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay I'm not gonna sit here and hold it up as some kind of patron saint of good design there are tons of decisions that rankle me but</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't think any of that shit you just went into is a thing in it. It's faults lie elseware I figure</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: Mostly around animation, Monty's not good at subtle tbqh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what does the story do that isnt derivative and predictable</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: The hug in ep. 8 w/ Yang and Ruby you can see it being kind of weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And also, tropes are not bad :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just because it's groundbreaking doesn't mean it's not enjoyable :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: *just because it's not groundbreaking :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no but when your work is literally nothing but a series of tropes strung together?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: You mean every work? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If I say as of now the story's honestly kinda meh I wonder if Nova'll clock me</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: You can't have a series that doesn't contain tropes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont be a smartass about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you know what i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: it doesnt even try to put tropes together in unusual ways, or subvert them, or anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: i'm still laughing over one comment in particular SL made but you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: just fuck it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its just a series of predictable anime cliches</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  shrug. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: by "gundam ripoffs" i mean the cliched angular design just fyi</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The music and fight scenes are good enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: not the giant robit concept</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Even if it's predictable, it doesn't mean it's boring :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Honestly, I love the fight scenes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i can give it the fight scenes</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And it reminds me of good anime :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: Monty is /really/ good at fight scenes. Though I kept thinking "Dead Fantasy"</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The story's pretty meh I feel like in big part because nothing's really been /done/ with it. Another design decision, breaking it into these 5-10 minute chunks and slowly scattering them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That format kills me because for a while it was just</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I like the music.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but i like my anime to have a bit more than that</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: People walking around</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: the music is great</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The music is amazing :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: god i fucking love the music</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: anyway imma grab lunch/dinner, brb</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: don't even try to diss the music :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: in like a half-hour</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And the dialog is self-aware and vaguely witty at times but even that can only take it so far</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: k</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well yeah but even cheetahmen had good music so</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: /sanic 06/ had good music</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: anyway yeah bye</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Later mate</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I get the kind of pop-entertainment isn't really for everyone but like I said the design's</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Thinking on it, a double-edged sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I kinda feel it reminds me of Outlaw Star. Which wasn't the best anime, but it was one that was both really nostalgic to me and gave me a great sense of adventure :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I can plop down a few minutes a week to get through it mostly for the fight scenes and occasional laugh, if it was longer, a full-length series with this same pace I don't think I could handle it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT existentialPenguin <span style="color:#133295">[CEP]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: i'm not going to lie lots of stuff that can be improved on with--</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: oh my god they have the RWBY Chapter 1 music for Torchwick's part in episode eiiiiight</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: that really nice part when Torchwick's walking to the Dust shop in ep. 1 </span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: that part of the song along with Ruby's fight up to the end of that was my favorite i think</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The great thing to think about, from an optimistic view, :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Is that it will improve :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah I mean Ruby I can take, I guess. I don't really know /why/ on first attempt she's pretty slight too and that's a big-ass scythe but i guess she jsut makes it work</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: talk to be about what the compilation did to cloud</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: dude i wish i could show you, there was a comparison post that laid it out amazingly</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Cloud originally wasn't even supposed to be as angsty :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean they took cloud as he was for like 5 minutes during an emotional breakdown</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: art from vii side by side with dissidia art</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i should hope</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Cloud originally was actually sort of like a socially anxious John Egbert :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ff7 is a great game but everything about its fans and its expanded universe is awful</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He liked to prank, but he didn't know social situations and he didn't know what to say :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: is there still a sa paywall?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think one of the directors actually admitted "His character was more or less made into this angsty brooder-type to pander to the fans"</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: If you notice Zack Fair's character, that's what Cloud was originally supposed to be. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not in those exact words but basically</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And Cloud while he did have a lot of emotional stuff, it was sort of well hidden and he was trying to mimic Zack's personality :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Since he pretty much impersonated Zack from the start :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Tvtropes sums it up pretty well: :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Flanderization: If you haven't played the original game, you'll be surprised at how non angsty Cloud was. He did angst and express hesitation and insecurities, but only at key points and for good reasons, and at the end of the game seemed perfectly fine. In his appearances since, he has been an angsty brooding loner. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He still had moments of angst throughout the game, but when it happened, there was good reason and it was during key points. Like Aerith's death and when he learned that his memories were fake. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But outside of that, :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He was like this adorkable dude :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sword held at the ready over the shoulder, gaze forward, stance steady.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sword just /barely/ held, almost at the ground. Sullen expression cast downward as if to say "why bother". Slumped position to suggest much the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's funny, though, if you think about it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, throughout the compilation :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Cloud's and Sephiroth's personalities got swapped :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: guess so</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like Sephiroth was originally really brooding and moody and dark :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But in later releases :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: he was just sort of a smirking villain :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Flanderization: Invoked in-universe. After his second death at the end of VII, he survives dissolution in the Lifestream by focusing on his hatred of Cloud and his desire for vengeance, giving him a strong enough emotional core to maintain his sense of self at the cost of letting less-focused traits be stripped away. This is why, come Advent Children, he's completely absorbed in rubbing his revival in Cloud'</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah, invoked :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I suppose that makes sense, then :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I just thought it was kind of interesting how in later events of the stories, their personalities kind of swapped with each other. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So he's got an excuse, at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though at least with Sephiroth, he sort of has an excuse :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, speaking of FF VII, Tifa is my headcanon for SA. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aeris might have an excuse in being /dead/. Like I dunno, maybe being dead doesn't give you much room to be all minxy and such</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I forgot why Aeris had to die, though I know Sephiroth had some reason or another. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's funny that her final limit break is only obtainable after she dies. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Funny, not haha :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just sorta ironic :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if you want a headcanon for my character, at least voice-wise, just watch some retsupurae and listen to diabetus</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought it was the opposite, her last Limit Break was available super early </span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So your headcanon voice for your character is Wilford Brimley? :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It was everything that VII should have been, imo :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: vi is best</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It was even darker in subject matter than VII, but it masked the darker nature with more lighthearted characters :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It has a ton of comic relief, but it talks a LOT about death :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And Vivi is both the cutest and most tragic character ever :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just thinking about Viv is like "aww, so adorable" but then comes the feels :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but first impressions are not good</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...and by standard, I'm guess ya taking about the skeleton asseholes from world 4?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: because those guys can kiss my ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dude im still on the first world i think</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the castle place</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Ah. Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...how far are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but i mean like in ghosts n goblins (my favorite hard game) the zombies in the first world can kill a player even if hes made it to the end, though they can still be saved with experience</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: still at the very beginning</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: some castle walls</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: again: maybe it picks up, but im not liking it so far</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: It does pick up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think the key thing in classic hard games is a frantic feeling</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Fuck world 5.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: just fuck it with a rusty spork.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And Dark Souls II is supposed to be more difficult when it comes out :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and that horrifying visage emerged</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We need</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A good battle-system in place for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: we could just do a simplified d20</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Strife tournament? :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: plus i think theres free hs combat systems out there</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah i was thinking of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: we all enter characters and then have a tourney</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Interesting idea, getting it done would take a miracle but I'd be game</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: or we could just have it  freeform and have a ref to stop godmodding</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That might work</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: it could just be a bracket where the battles just happen when 2  players and a ref are online</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: assuming it's in the Dojo, Ash already has a basic d20 attack/defend system for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh ok we can use that</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Meh. I don't really like the d20 system just because it's simply OOC luck, not so much character skill.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think we should do freeform with a ref</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually yeah, freeform would be more fun...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Freeform is hella more fun. It's why I tend to fight not in the dojo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also it shouldnt be a bracket system it should be a grid system</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so nobody loses in the first round and then just watches bored for  the rest of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: should i bring this idea up ic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe not today with how much Incipi is exploding plus EQ's event later tonight, but yeah</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't even know what you're talking about so yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: grid means everyone fights everyone else once</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: as opposed to an elimination bracket</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: that'd be kinda fun I guess yeah.</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So much pasting to do :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: which having it part of the characters knowledge as opposed to just a dumb twist could be good</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: CSL: why do you need to be outside CEP: Because your character requires sunlight or some shit :&gt; CSJ: oh yeah, that's the one that literally requires sunlight in order to play ➜ CSL: hahahawhat CSL: thats incredible CRS: It's a Hideo game, the MC hunts vampires and such CSL: and if you want to play it at night, fuck you CSL: definitely need that one CSJ: unless you hav like, a heat lamp ➜ CRS: If</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">play at night you can still play, you just have fewer options and have to stealth, I think CSJ: dunno the exact mechanic of how it detects it ➜ CSL: but yes should the stupid bc09 twist be part of the crossover setting CSJ: um, probably not? ➜ CSL: so bionic limbs should just be cyborg stuff with no terrible genetic bonding nonsense CEP: Imagine if every single part of your body was bionic :&gt; :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Have fun, CP :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: welp</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well in bc09 its not revealed that his wife is an arm until the very end</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I saw this one tumblr post that reminds me of the humor I often have :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Where this person was like "lick my pu**y" and someone replied "lick your own damn puppy" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: despite him having had the arm for 3-5 games depending on what you consider canon</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I would so be the one saying "lick your own damn puppy" :&gt;</span><br />
