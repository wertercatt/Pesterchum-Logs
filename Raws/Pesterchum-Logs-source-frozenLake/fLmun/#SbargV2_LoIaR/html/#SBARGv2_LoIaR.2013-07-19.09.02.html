[01:13:00] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {what are they?}</span><br />
[01:13:05] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, AP is a pool of energy that players draw from within themselves to pull off awesome moves and such. </span><br />
[01:13:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: They usually call it by some variation of of the name, but generally the're all refering to the same thing, unless note that it isn't.</span><br />
[01:15:00] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but anyways, that stuff drains when you use a lot of your abilities and it usually takes some rest to restore it.</span><br />
[01:15:51] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {ok }</span><br />
[01:15:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you can tell of you're running low on it if you're particularly tired.</span><br />
[01:17:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: of course, if you're careful about spacing out how much you use it, you should be fine.</span><br />

[01:18:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, now that we got that out of the way, let's get to some timey stuff.</span><br />
[01:18:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sure you know how to pull off a simple stable timeloop, right?</span><br />
[01:19:16] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {i think i did one}</span><br />
[01:19:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I might as well go over some stuff on it.</span><br />
[01:20:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it dependsd on wether you're going forwards or backwards.</span><br />
[01:20:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *depends *whether</span><br />
[01:20:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *meh</span><br />
[01:21:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: for forward loops, those are usually considered safer, though you should usually try and avoid causal spoilers as much as possible.</span><br />
[01:21:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and of course try to go back as soon as possible when you're done.</span><br />
[01:22:32] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {ok}</span><br />
[01:22:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: for backwards loops, you usually need to get some sort of confirmation that it had happened already, though if you're careful enough you might be able to pull off a really sneaky one.</span><br />
[01:22:56] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {i went back to warn me about a quest}</span><br />
[01:23:18] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {understood}</span><br />
[01:24:00] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and as usual, only stay as long as you're supposed to, unless you're supposed to coast forward.</span><br />
[01:24:46] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {ok}</span><br />
[01:24:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though unless you're supposed to be older than the others later on, usually it's not a good idea to coast too much.</span><br />
[01:25:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that pretty much covers those.</span><br />
[01:26:19] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {i see}</span><br />
[01:26:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anything in particular you want me to explain?</span><br />

[01:27:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then.</span><br />
[01:28:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, sometimes that can get a little sticky. It tends to stifle and sometimes even railroad the timeline if you're not careful.</span><br />
[01:29:46] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {i see}</span><br />
[01:30:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: usually it's best to only focus on the things you need to focus on and then let the rest of the future just pan out in addition to what you will have done</span><br />
[01:31:33] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {got it}</span><br />
[01:31:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: really, it's an exersize in continuity, fitting the puzzle pieces together in a way that fits as firmly as possible.</span><br />
[01:32:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: as long as it works out the way it's supposed to, it's usually going to be okay.</span><br />

[01:33:32] <span style="color:#ff007d">CSB: {ok}</span><br />
