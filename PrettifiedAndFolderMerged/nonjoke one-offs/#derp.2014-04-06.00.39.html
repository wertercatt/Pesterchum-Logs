<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I did SET <a href='#derp'>#derp</a> entrymsg msg</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Just don't play around with bans because you probably don't know how to and using chanServ to ban can get really messed up really fast</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: If Rob and Ash hash it out in PM I ain't gonna mind at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: but I just hope he doesn't do it in the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: i hope he doesnt do it in a PM</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: because he will drag it to the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: or she will</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: and screw the whole thing up</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: i need you guys to be on best behavior</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: There's nothing to even screw up, it's us telling them "Ay yo man we're doing this"</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: and what if they say no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Then nothing happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: This isn't a negotiation, it's not permission, it's "hey, we're gonna do a thing, figured it'd be the nice thing to do to tell you guys"</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: no need to put on airs and be on our ~best behavior~, as simple as putting up a flier for a new band in the BotB</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: it would still be nice for us to be nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: i dont want feelings like "they are abandoning us to do their own thing, lets never let them back in the other memo"</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: cause that would be a problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: "They're abandoning us to do their own thing and have their own fun. Let's never let them back here" because</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: because they're seven?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: is that actually a thing they would do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: im just thinking possible scenarios for going wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: i dont know what they will actually do or say</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: but its just good planning</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: There's possible scenarios, then there's possible scenarios for possible scenarios</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn it, I forgot how to connect via hexchat ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I mean yeah, it's good planning, but it's not there yet. To get those feelings into a tangible moment where they'd ban us from every v2 memo and denounce us would take a lot more than "Shit dawg, doin a new spin-off"</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: not just that</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: There'd have to be at least a week or two of festering and hate mongering before that kind of tantrum response would get close to reality, and anywhere along the line you could get like</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: "wait, isn't that kinda childish?" from any source and bam, it's gone</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I told it to connect to the correct addres, but it won'tlet me, even with an untaken handle. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm wondering how Noodles got to connect today on his phone though ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Do you need to register your handle first?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Is Hexchat the one that gives you like a different IP or is just an IC client</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: IRC*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it's just a regular IRC client? ➜</span><br />
