<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, considering some of the enemies seem to be using kerbalKind weapons... that's probably what we need.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...still can't believe I have to unlock brush abilities SEPARATELY from the brush itself. that means I need 14 +ability powerups at a /minimum/ &gt;:[</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno, someone said that at some point I thought</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so SJ, that book you got in the dungeon a good read?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well pre entry i guess i could be breath or doom\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: haven't opened it yet. too busy right now. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pre-entry I suspected either Mind or Breath...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: or at least that's what i had thought but i always thought time would be a challenge for me\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I think it's probably absconding time... and tonight, I'm not going anywhere /near/ the Prospit Post Office.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *the LoSaCrystal dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: oh i had no idea about that dungeon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know what, since I pretty much missed everything due to that really stupid zone-out, I'm going to go do that 1st part, since I haven't gone on that mission for my past self yet for some reason. ➜</span><br />
