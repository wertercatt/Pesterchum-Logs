<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok basically, Gambit went missing, we tracked her down to LoIaV, stuff happened with noncollideable terrain (not Magicant-kind, just normal "can't touch this"), followed a trail of destruction and stuff, eventually found her, but she was Keter Tier Berserk Trigger and her anti-dog instincts were fully active, so I had to run like hell until Ash and the others managed to calm her down... one feelings jam later, and we're back at the cafe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because apparently we're not alowed to say /anything/ becvause we're al too /paranoid/ to let anything slipwhile everyone else out of the loop is left out and feeling horrible because it seems like nothing is happening and meanwhile buttface and sasuke are laughing over salad together as they watch us writhe in fear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: letting people know you're watching or have spies is actually a really good way to keep people out of the loop</span><br />
