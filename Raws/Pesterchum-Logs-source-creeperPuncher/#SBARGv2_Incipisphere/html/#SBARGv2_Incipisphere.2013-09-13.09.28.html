<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then after we install antivirus on it, we are totally installing Java and Minecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All opposed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … not really, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: his piece of shit network got broken and what we have to do doesn't make sense. plus nothing's happening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all opposed to installing minecraft on LOBAT's network?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i do think finding the wi-fi vs finding the cate is a tricky dilemma</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … we can take a cat-finding break.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all who actually want to do my silly plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no one cares fl</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so noone would care if I took the time later to study the network and figure out how the operating system works so I can actually get Java and thus Minecraft running on a land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might be kinda cool, I guess. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you'd have to ask DS for permission, as he's the land owner...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: assuming its not just having programs running directly to the assembly</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: it's just the network there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: minceraft sucks</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: in a coma I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: FL is right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Although living in catatonia can cause brain damage over time, and that can result in death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...quick question, do you think chronos needs to eat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: But there are reports of people living for years in a coma, and coming out normal, if not a bit confused.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ugh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Probably similar to Sopor Slime</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, you read that theory too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /best theory/</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: What theory&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that apparently the reason Gamzee is pseudo-immortal despite not actually being tiered because he ate so much sopor which might be paradox slime</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: liquid stem cells basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and since paradox slime is basically life-giving goo or can be interpreted as such</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then explain how Dirk and Roxy's houses appeared near the same time in session as Jane and Jake?</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Well, considering the glitches are pretty prevalent in our session, most things can be handwaved with a glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: As for your inane comment about "still getting Noobs"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a bug, its a /feature/!</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: As a noob, you can fuck off with that shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And they all started the Game at around the same time frame for all of them. Yes, they were four hundred years apart, but even so, they were all still talking to each other, and all appeared in the Medium at the same Medium-time.</span><br />

<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: As for the actually intelligent question about Skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think so, yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And who knows how many more there will be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: It would finish aplying the first changes it had, then que the second one</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: It would continue in order basicallt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So we have to wait for every single person to join who's going to, despite the fact we can't predict their entries, in order for our field to finish and us to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Basically*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... we have at /most/ 7 more months to wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ugh. Fuck it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 according to teh tehroy of delayed entry :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as with the time delay formula, that would be when people would /stop/ joining.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 24 hours of meteors on earth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 until a year passes, teh BF isnt finished :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, a normal session requires all players to survive</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, here's the dumbest question in the history of Paradox Space... /why hasn't anyone just gone to Prospit or Derse and counted how many prototyping towers aren't lit yet/????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because overflow</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, that's not true. potential of a session to succeed is not dependent on all players surviving, only on all players prototyping something pre-entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it sure helps to have players survive, but it's not an auto fail condition if they don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: last time I checked... the towers were rings of light, not spheres like normal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: much like the rings</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp. fuck my plan then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: I prototyped a 1/4 full bottle of powerade preentry, was that smart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: or stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so, what part of that will we see in underlings?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's weird... but as long as you threw SOMETHING at the seizure kernal, ya good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: i figured protyping something thats weak will be helpful</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1/4th underlings, hyper underlings, or bottle underlings?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: option 3</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or I should say, if my theory is right, something that is not a Perfectly Generic Object or thing with an unreadable captchacode, like a pumpkin or Sbarg disc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Yeah, I prototyped a computer, and an anime girl poster giving me PCPron imps (To quote PK)</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Yeah :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually FLord said he prototyped a PGO last session... and he got a cube sprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 I figure il extend teh offer to you, would you like to join my team SR? :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, guess my theory's wrong then about prototyping data determined by alchemically mashing together the objects in question...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that, or a PGO just counts as not having affected the underlings in question, but still counts as "prototyped a thing" for battlefield purposes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: … Perfectly Generic Underlings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's what they are. Just compurrletely generic :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: In response to PK's offer: Sure why not</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually, considering that upon creation PGO's come in contact with oxygen and actually have a shape... I think it might make underlings... more generic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: more... blocky?</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … The entire point I was trying to make was that painting people as villains gets other people to believe them to be villains and thus… act rashly, and it can lead to things /no one wanted to happen/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it was your decision. yes. and it was cause. influenced. and derived from her words and actions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  but it was<span style="color:#730e8f"> MY decision</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: oh my god...</span><br />

<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  which was spurred by w<span style="color:#730e8f">hat YOUR ACTIONS did</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: .......</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  you are just a<span style="color:#730e8f">s much responsible</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: Just fucking kill me somebody</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FS, we're not saying she forced you to do anything. Just that you got the idea to attack /us/ from her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: I never told him to attack you</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: because i won't coddle her insecurities.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I didn't say you did, FA.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: Why would I tell anyone to attack or kill anyone on my behalf</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You /have/ said that it's the three of us that hurt you, though. Saying you told him to do that is /not/ what I'm saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: All I'm saying is he got the idea we were responsible from you and decided himself to act on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: Im done im just... gonna go lie down</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: Nobody wants any of this....death is not going to fix it...and you shouldn't talk about killing yourself it doesn't solve anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: Im not going too</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: she said you were talking about it</span><br />
