<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not even bluetooth</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i wasn't finished</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ SPEAK THEN, MAN /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there is the chance that the turrets are singular units</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Else he wouldn't be able to control the turrets and such.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: by that i mean everything is built right into it then</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they're fully automated</span><br />
