<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's pretty gppd</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: that would make it aprox. 20% cooler.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff6600">CSV: Even though I'm amused by your affections to the MLP:FIM series I am not convinced untill faced with a concrete reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What if we need to fist fight a moon</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, is there a JPEG generator? I believe that we could use one to power a "Mr. Fusion" and get Artifact Grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I'm gonna keep a mini robot on standby just in case</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: You never know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ROW ROW, FIGHT THE POWER!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think gimp should be enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: eh, if you want</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I think we should have an automated version...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: paint.net works well enough too</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: but PDN at 0% quality can out-SBaHJ mspaint</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That upon pressing a switch, floods a room with artifact grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: hmm. has anyone ever tried spamming paradox ghost slime, then recycling the slime pile into grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly, that costs boon dollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: bluh. true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its free to recycle alchmeized objects, but anything else costs boondollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: wait boon dollars have a function=</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, recycling objects that cost any grist type gives you normal build grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, you could get build grist from artifact grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But then you have piles of jpeg crap, which is why you need a mr fusion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You know, with me talking about physics all the time, I think I might know my aspect now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: there's also the stock exchange on the land of _____ and clockwork, for exchanging any grist for any other grist</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: if dave had spammed artifact grist, he could've made a fucking killing without having to set up so many time loops</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (assuming nakkadiles are dumb enough to buy artifact)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: but using timeloops is so much cooler</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I believe that I am the "??? of Space."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, which class abuses their aspect?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, he didn't really "abuse" time travel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: What? Yeah that was basically all he ever did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Gratuitous abuse of time travel to get shit done was his middle name</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He could have done so much more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Is 'Chris Brown' an aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Or would be if that wasn't a long-ass name</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SO. MUCH. MORE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Is 'I'm gonna punch you' an aspect</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda sucked early on.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no idea what a title is right now but that could change really fast</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Though I have no Idea what space could do with steam and crossroads... I don't see any frogs, but maybe thats not always the case when there is a massive ammount of players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have frogs!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you need some?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Never mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Don't need frogs then</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do I need these frogs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, if they spawned on your land, YES.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: frogs aren't technically exclusive to Land of X and Frogs, fyi. john found a few on LOWAS, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's just if Frogs is in the land title that you're definitely a Space player</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Frogs and Rubble has a lot of Frogs, yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: there you go :P</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, it feels like space with my talking about physics, but I don't have a frog land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I used to think I was a Mind player (claspect tests and pre-entry life experience correlating as such), but now, I don't have a clue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: only ones I know I'm not are Space (no Frogs land parameter) and Time (no clock-themed land parameter)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So are you telling me I have the space</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: based on what we've seen in canon, pretty good chance of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (though Frogs as the *first* half of the land title is unusual)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fascinating stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I could be light...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As Light can also symbolize knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((probably what happened there is the FG just made a flat-out randomizer for the land name thing, with no checks for specific items or if you get the same thing twice))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fuel and Metal based grist... its decent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So... Page of Light perhaps?</span><br />
