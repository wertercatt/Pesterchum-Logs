<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do I have feelings to hurt in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or do I just manage to fake them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably faking them, why you're such a shitty firebender.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Or at least, I figure you can shoot fire around for a reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I fake guilt, as well... so if I were to /stop/ faking the feelings...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: And have feelings like a normal, not idiot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah then I could probably hurt them a lot more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or I'm just a complete psychopath and would have no emotion... okay scratch that, my emotions are totally real.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Naaaah..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell me Emberess, how fast would you die if one of those dice was slipped into your food?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Also Kimura, you do realize that its ironic that its coming from you, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes. yes I do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: At least I can die, I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I know what that means at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Y'know it's probably who I'm such a badass firebug compared to you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { why instead of who* }</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how the hell did I survive to go godtier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How did I survive that long?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was because I manipulated the alchemy system to give myself an edge on the monsters. To survive as long as I possibly could.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With auto regen and items that prevented a blow from taking me under 1hp...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: don't feel bad FL, I kinda did that too with my badges. Emergency Point Swap, anyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And now I realize why everything in this universe can kill me easily.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because alchemy is disabled</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: HAH</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What a bitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah. Because I grew too used to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I bet you couldn't even beat me in a sword fight, even with all those stupid swords.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I thought I would never lose it, and then I did...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that reminds me FL, lemme know when you fix the freaking AU Machine. I need to replicate a Door Station to put on Augataur.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I thought it would never change. But then it all came crashing down around me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kimura, I don't think those can be replicated, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why? it seems like it's just tech-based only...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unless it's the same problem as the stargate</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Basically my IC justification for preventing hypertech items from being replicated ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((mmk))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe you could ask Brad to spawn one in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And me now abusing the fact that Voiders are walking alchemiters. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( :V ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Man, looks like my empire's time to shine is now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in the meantime though, I made a visit yesterday and put a remote-terminal on the Augataur-side door to turn it on or off from there, being powered by the Starter-side station.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Well none of that makes you emotional at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, like that isn't the shit I dealt with on a daily basis.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: How about I start trying what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: this is gonna be good, isn't it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: How long have you been here now. Three days? Maybe four?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, just a Hotel class fantasy universe realization.  Its gonna happen to everyone eventually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, it even explains homestuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And those all end up existing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its funny, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Not enough to understand this kinda miserable brand of dumb</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I wonder if that's what AS was babbling about the other day... if she had a form of that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: But it's been like a week or more now</span><br />
<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: Then that just makes the percentage of what an absolute bitch you've been while being here even higher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wonder what would happen if our hotel characters visited this universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: So how about trying to quit antagonizing everyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would likely be pretty awkward, wouldn't it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: about as awkward as us meeting the pseudoexiles, probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Expecially when we tried to claim that we were controlling them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually scratch that; as awkward as us meeting /our specific/ exiles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I've met PK's, he's kinda a weirdo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, it would be pretty much the same, wouldn't it. Voices that claim they control us, when really they just /think/ they control us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be like Harry Potter meeting JK Rowling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be like Andrew Hussie meeting Andrew Hussie, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, the Pseudoexiles likely have someone writing about them, too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how many layers /are/ there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Likely would be some sort of shitty High School anime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pseudoexile, us, Hotel...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm willing to bet that there are /multiple/ universes with them being written about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Hotel version of JK Rowling compared to our version of JK Rowling, both writing the harry potter series.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might just be that in some way, shape, or form, everything is a universal constant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda sound like a nightblogger, don't I.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "In an infinite universe, all things are possible." "There is nothing new in Paradox Space."</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ergo, every universe is a paradox clone of itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I'm probably not taking advice from the likes of you, bein honest.</span><br />
