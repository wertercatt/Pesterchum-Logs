<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nothing, the Land is just being pulled torwards the blue hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...May I make a suggestion?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((three pesterchums? I've done it before with CP/IJ/ammySprite...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is it safer than whatever's going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I swear if you suggest that we shoot into the blue hole, I am going to end you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: No... well, not exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I was going to suggest trying to slingshot around it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I... that might work, but its risky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I was thinking something from Mario Galaxy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we screw up, we might get pulled in faster.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there's that one mission with disappearing platforms and music notes, and when you get all the notes, the black hole COLLAPSES INTO A POWER STAR!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doubt that will specifically work, but maybe something else from the game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Well, its that or managing to cancel out the accerlation of the land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#970025">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Wait a minute...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I'm incoming on the Arkaiser. I think I'm gonna try and deploy all the anchors in a spread formation...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: How much grist do we have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Kimura you got any brush magic that can toughen up the chains?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'm sorry, what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: don't think so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not enough to scale the Gravity Deflector to a large enough point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Welp, looks like we have to go with PS!FL's plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "PS!FL"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Actually, hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Is there a way you can scale the effects, even if it doesn't completely cancel out the gravity?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Perhaps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, maybe anchors + a Magnetism/Galestorm combo...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I wonder... If Reinforcement would work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maroon!FL: Gravity Brassierre? nah that's stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Damn... Jovin's the only one around who gets my Fate refs</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Well, its that or slingshotting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'm getting out of here while I still can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: See you later... hopefully.</span><br />
