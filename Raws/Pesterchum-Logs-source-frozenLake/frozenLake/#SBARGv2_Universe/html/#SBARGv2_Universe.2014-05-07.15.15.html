[15:15:19] <span style="color:#000000">CCC</span> took away <span style="color:#0070e0">FL</span>'s OP powers.<br />
[16:00:00] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Hey Kimura.</span><br />
[16:00:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[16:00:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
[16:14:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: How are you holding up?</span><br />
[16:15:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, pretty good overall.</span><br />
[16:15:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also I replied to your anon asks last night, check my "#a wild anon appeared" tag))</span><br />
[16:17:59] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (( I see it. Thanks. ))</span><br />
[16:19:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So... you at the bar or what?</span><br />
[16:21:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
[16:22:28] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alright... just was wondering</span><br />
[16:29:56] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Have you been getting into interstellar trade?</span><br />
[16:33:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, no. apparently you have?</span><br />
[16:33:34] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: No, actually.</span><br />
[16:34:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, you were just wondering if anyone else had tried?</span><br />
[16:34:21] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[16:37:55] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...starting to think the effort I put into getting the AU Machine functioning to the point it is now was completely wasted.</span><br />
[16:41:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I... honestly don't know.</span><br />
[16:41:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Why should I maintain it when noone is going to use it?</span><br />
[16:42:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's not my fault - or yours - that everyone seems to have lol'd off who knows where...</span><br />
[16:42:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........if anything, it's NN's fault for what happened during that argument a month ago &gt;_&gt;))</span><br />
[16:42:34] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, most of them can't be further than the moons.</span><br />
[16:43:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (( The one involving SL or another one? ))</span><br />
[16:43:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yes, that one.))</span><br />
[16:44:12] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (( I've been trying to forget about it. ))</span><br />
[16:44:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sorry... but yeah, I think that argument is why people have mostly given up on v2.))</span><br />
[16:45:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((not because of the fact that Ben is still banned, but the attitude NN had toward v2 being supposedly theirs and the other GMs' intellectual property))</span><br />
[16:51:42] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (( ...@_@ ))</span><br />
