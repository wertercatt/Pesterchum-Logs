[03:32:46] <span style="color:#000000">AE: The question was more along the lines of its capability to be used as trade fodder.</span><br />
[03:33:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What does gambit want</span><br />
[03:33:07] <span style="color:#000000">AE: You are in possession of someone I'm interested in.</span><br />
[03:33:10] <span style="color:#000000">AE: Not my partner.</span><br />
[03:33:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[03:33:25] <span style="color:#000000">AE: In actuality, she does not know I'm contacting you.</span><br />
[03:33:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: DT actually told me to punch that card the other day...</span><br />
[03:33:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I don't really know what to do.</span><br />
[03:34:35] <span style="color:#000000">AE: The feline robot?</span><br />
[03:35:01] <span style="color:#000000">AE: I'm interested in it, and my partner and I have already set up a containment facility should one of our robotic allies happen to go rogue.</span><br />
[03:35:24] <span style="color:#000000">AE: I have no reason to believe it would not contain this one as well, and it would not be your problem to deal with anymore.</span><br />
[03:36:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And why would Gambit agree to giving up the card?</span><br />
[03:36:50] <span style="color:#000000">AE: She doesn't remember she has it and I am able to control her Sylladex well enough, as she has granted me that access.</span><br />
[03:37:09] <span style="color:#000000">AE: She is also inclined to trust me and acquiesce to my more reasonable desires.</span><br />
[03:37:48] <span style="color:#000000">AE: If I were to transfer possession of your card to Lyrasprite, it could be done with or without her knowledge, but I could not think of anything else you would desire.</span><br />
[03:40:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Does this have anything to do with DT mentioning how he wasn't a player in a tag?</span><br />
[03:40:56] <span style="color:#000000">AE: I simply have an interest in the feline robot and the intelligence occupying it.</span><br />
[03:41:08] <span style="color:#000000">AE: â€¦ And would like to retrieve it from DT's custody, admittedly.</span><br />
[03:41:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Actually, its simply timelocked inside of a card.</span><br />
[03:41:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What are you planning to do with it?</span><br />
[03:41:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Or is that hush hush?</span><br />
[03:41:52] <span style="color:#000000">AE: I am aware of its current arrangements.</span><br />
[03:42:16] <span style="color:#000000">AE: It would be kept in the containment facility we have arranged-- you could drop it off there yourself if that made you feel more secure.</span><br />
[03:42:38] <span style="color:#000000">AE: I would like to talk with it a bit on my own.</span><br />
[03:42:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: DT has stated that he doesn't want Athena getting it back.</span><br />
[03:42:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: and I agree in that respect.</span><br />
[03:42:52] <span style="color:#000000">AE: I have no plans to deal with the Denizen.</span><br />
[03:43:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Alright.</span><br />
[03:43:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Meet me in the basement.</span><br />
[03:43:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: of the HQ</span><br />
[03:43:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: well, have Lyra meet me</span><br />
[03:43:54] <span style="color:#000000">AE: Easily arranged. My partner is in the dojo at the moment.</span><br />
[03:44:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'll do the trade there.</span><br />
