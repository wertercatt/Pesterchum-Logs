[18:30:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, considering how fucking rich we all got from CS economy-wrecking, 12.24 megagrist of every type would be feasible... /with the exception of motherbarking Zillium/, which I'm not sure if it's even available in stock exchanges!</span><br />
[18:30:33] <span style="color:#55007f">CPK: what</span><br />

[18:31:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: PK: SE needed an unallocated strife card, I was mentioning that they can be alchemized but cost an unreasonable amount of EVERY type of grist...</span><br />

[18:36:30] <span style="color:#55007f">CPK: CaFaI expended fucktons of my grist on LoCaL's "improvements"</span><br />
[18:37:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, even without grist hoards (which we can't touch anyway), we could definitely afford to alchemize blank strife cards... except for fucking zillium which can't be bought at stock exchanges</span><br />
