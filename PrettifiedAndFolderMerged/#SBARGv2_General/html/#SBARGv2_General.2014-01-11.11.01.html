[04:57:57] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Because theyy blatantlyy Insulted kayylen on multiple occasions and it was not at all okayy /)</span><br />

[04:58:28] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Also blatantlyy insulted me too but this isnt about me /)</span><br />
[04:59:52] <span style="color:#00aa7f">CMD: Y'know, if you had all just explained to me why you wanted the denizens and had maybe been civil about it, I would have let it go. But then it got personal when you started attacking ME for how I was running MY arg, of which wouldn't have even existed without me.</span><br />
[05:00:20] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ This ^ /)</span><br />
[05:01:28] <span style="color:#00aa7f">CMD: I was doing my fucking job of moderating the roleplay because Ash was being attacked for also doing her job of being another of the other GMs and saying no to denizens.</span><br />

[05:05:22] <span style="color:#00aa7f">CMD: Saying you're sorry can only do so much, and if I remember correctly, you're not looking to be forgiven so I'm not going to forgive you.</span><br />
