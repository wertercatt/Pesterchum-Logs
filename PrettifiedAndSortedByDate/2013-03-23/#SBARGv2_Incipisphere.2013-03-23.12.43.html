<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, knocked them off this spire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, is there a way to get my health vial back into this slime?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its kinda hanging out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...should I just see If I can grab it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL: talk to your sprite, or eat something</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: enemies also sometimes drop gel that heals you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...why would eating something recover my health... oh video game logic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yup ^_^</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: excuse me as I go and make a single ring from the sonic games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's actually a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, that is WAY too much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: make 50, then make the chaos emeralds. &amp;&amp;-combine them, instant Super Sonic</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't think I'm gonna be able to afford this for a LONG time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, we might have to grist widget a few meteors to afford it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: really? that much for a single ring?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O;;;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: assuming I could get the boondollars for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe there's cheaper ways to get one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, considering it would make you invincible if you could pick it up everytime...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: wait, do you have the enlarger upgrade? check to see if the item defaults to "Goal Ring size", that might be your problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...no, its not a goal ring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah, on the smallest setting, Its still overboard by several magnatudes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's probably that the game "knows" it's a conditional-invincibility item</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, I did use secret rings inorder to make the code, so maybe Its making the wrong item?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: urp... should not have accepted my consorts' drinking contest challenge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay yeah that seems like It would only take one meteor to make this time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: bob-ombs or not, you cannot beat russians at a drink-off. they are simply the best there is. brb pressing L</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, the unit of zillium should have been my clue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a copy of sonic 2 for the sega genesis that I could get you the code for. Would that help?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't need it, I have Sonic &amp; Knuckles Collection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The code is 0G26XGDs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, the code for my raspberry pi is "hyLJKhhy"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just incase you guys need a low grist cost computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 Build Grist, 1 gold, and 4 of what ever that red cube grist is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sweet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, let me check.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, Rust.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, 3 BuildGrist, 1 Gold, and 4 Rust.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: groovey</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh my gosh, I can't believe I said that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: @ _@</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh hey, In alphabetical order, its 3, 1, and 4.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3.14, or Pi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sburb, you are awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, the hole punch pattern is cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: that's nothing. for science, I burned a disc copy of homestuck to see how much grist it costs. 413 of every grist type <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I am getting REALLY sick of SweetTarts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, I think that the fact that the planet seems to be quaking may be a bad thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's your land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Land of Steam and Crossroads...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might be the sugar though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would also explain the horrible headache.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you have any codes for any healthier foods?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No, not really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because that could probably help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Imps raided the fridge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you can probably get some food codes off the tags. right now I'm a little preoccupied with things to send a bunch of fod codes atm</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *food</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to make some sort of list...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe we should ask NN to set up another spreadsheet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#6505ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: I really need τo find τhaτ lisτ of mine..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I still have a large amount of artifact grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I seem to be getting more when ever I turn away... oh, that would explain it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how many sorDs did you make???</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, I think I have nightmares now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Imps seem to be weak to teleporting into walls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: don't have any codes with me right now, but I do have a suggestion for that candy hangover: Coffee Beans || Gushers</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good to know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, lets not use the gates as a underling killer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, the imps explode moments after death, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That moment you see them bisected by the wall...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't even want to imagine it..</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: this sums up my think pan's reaction right now: <a href='https://dl.dropbox.com/u/52541782/yahtzee_outoutout.gif'>https://dl.dropbox.com/u/52541782/yahtzee_outoutout.gif</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((yes! finally got an appropirate moment to use that gif! :D))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: anyway, that recipe should cure even a roxy-level hangover instantly. just don't eat too many of them at once...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been using the artifact grist the imps make with the alchemiter for captcha cards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still need a better modus than array and reverse recipe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or Ingredient Modus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As some people may call it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: do you have an empty backpack and a puzzle modus card? that's how I made my backpack modus</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't have a puzzle modus, but I do have a backpack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: see what happens if you use the array card instead, it might make something similar</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I should combine my array modus with my raspberry pi...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh my.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AMAZING.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need one of you to test this as well.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: h?VRUhh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to test the item share on this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, entering it into the thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( You got the Filesystem Modus! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I'll send an item... I'll need to spend some boondollars to put it on the cloud...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has put a unit of CRUXITE on the cloud. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, now you should be able to take it off for free...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've never used the cloud thingie before...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  Alright, one of your captcha cards should be a "shortcut"</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I see it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Upon use, It will take you to the cloud, where you can store items to share between players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or take items out, like you are doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, an upload costs a few boondollars, but it is worth it... when we get better items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least, I think it will be worth it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it has non-glitchy Skaia as the background for the menus on this thing. That's cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes Sburb, we get the "cloud" pun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now let me change my background already!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, I can't see the text!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: highlight it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the file system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't read the white text with all these WHITE clouds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#005500">[CCP]</span>  hears the IDS Glove activate and is suddenly buried by fluffy imps --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ........wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, apparently the method you kill imps changes the grist slightly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I seem to get more rare types when I'm clever about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it also depends on the weapon you use</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: doing a "finishing attack" with the celestial katana seems to give extra grist, as does one-hit kills (like the sever player crushing them with the alchemiter)</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: huh...reminds me of someτhing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, one hit kills have been giving me less grist... at least that I have seen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Balancing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: wait, now I remember. it's more STYLISH kills that give grist bonuses</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the one-hit kills I mentioned were done in a flashy way</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, like a DM giving extra EXP for being stylish in DND.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: while the Broken Gated imps someone mentioned were just wall-fragged, not giving much</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would have been me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: oh right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still creeps me out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You don't wanna see a torso slide down the wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yeah, a bit hard to remember when you've been buried under a pile of fluffy underlings because a consort wanted to push buttons on your glove</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still have oil on the walls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: meh, wouldn't creep me out THAT much. I've seen enough Gmod glitches to be used to ragdoll clipping bugs</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_e</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats an unrealistic video game... much like this, when you think of heat radiation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: convection schmonvection, a favorite trope of level designers across paradox space</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, I'm gonna see if lava really IS boiling koo-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, maybe I shouldn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just had a note appearify telling me not too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not to*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now I'll need to get to a meteor later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: that's funny, I was about to warn the time player to go save your burninated butt</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably should anyways to keep the timeloops intact.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, It may be a stable timeloop... with an information paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: aaaah why did I choose τhe spicy ramen ;▲;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, where did the information telling me not to come from in the first place?&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: isn't that why they call this place paradox space in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll just assume it came from a doomed timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...gog dammit I don't even know anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: It's probably best not to think too much about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, this is why I'm NOT a time hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know my aspect... or my title.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: neither do most of us here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the only ones that do know are those with Frogs as a land modifer, which should only be one player</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, we only have so many aspects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we have HUNDREDS of players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would make sense there is doubling up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I know doctorSpace has frogs in his land's name.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or tripling... or- okay I'll shut up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: back later. haven't had a shower since I entered, so might be a good idea to</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this thing is stil prety awesome.</span><br />
