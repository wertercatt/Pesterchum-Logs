<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  touch it --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  what is behind curtain number 1? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  The curtain shocks her initially, but is easily pulled aside, revealing...a decently large chamber actually, one that looks nice. In the center is a large spire, sitting on a smooth stone cylinder, a basin beneath filled with the water that came from the rivers above. On either side of the room are other cylinders, in front of those are two symbols, one looking like a circle, and the other looking like a set of 3 s --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, how much static was on that thing? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  But the most shocking feature, probably, is that hanging all over the walls are shreds of cloth in every color imaginable, and on these scraps are god tier symbols. Breath, Doom, Time, Space, Heart, Hope, all of them. All of them and more. Aspects you might not even think of. Like Piss, or something. Yeah, there's probably a Piss aspect on these stone walls. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  and then on the other side is another green curtain! That's always nice. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  steps into the room. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no idea what this is.</span><br />
