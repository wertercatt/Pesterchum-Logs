[11:20:53] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey Rob, Elsey, Charles if he's here.</span><br />
[11:21:15] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: hellΘ.</span><br />
[11:21:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey Rob you want this grief seed yet</span><br />
[11:23:07] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Later, I'm still on Hyxla.</span><br />
[11:23:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fuck.</span><br />
[11:23:22] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: wait, you didn't feed it to AS?</span><br />
[11:23:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I fed it to VS, it made her lose total control of her Void powers before she vomited out 2 souls and the grief seed.</span><br />
[11:24:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then I captchalogued all 3 of 'em and have 'em safely tucked away in the deck.</span><br />
[11:24:19] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We managed to push the battle into space so fighting on the surface, and wrecking it by extension, was kept to a minimal. But there was still a bit, I'm making sure as many people as possible are already and helping to fix things up.</span><br />
[11:24:22] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And uh</span><br />
[11:24:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Where the fuck did those two souls come from?</span><br />
[11:24:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No idea!</span><br />
[11:24:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: nowhere, likely.</span><br />
[11:24:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And why is everyone so eager to eat this thing jesus christ what's wrong with people.</span><br />
[11:25:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're confident their edges can outmatch the edges of this tiny metal object.</span><br />
[11:25:42] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Its like come on guys leave the evil soul eatting to the professionals you're just embarassing yourselves</span><br />
[11:25:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Meanwhile, I realized pirates can surf pretty damned well.</span><br />
[11:26:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And spaceship mechanics are very, very different from regular cars.</span><br />
[11:26:27] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well uh.</span><br />
[11:26:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Duh?</span><br />
[11:27:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean I figured but I definitely should've looked before I volunteered for this.</span><br />
[11:28:07] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You offered to fix up their ship?</span><br />
[11:28:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, I figured it was the nice thing to do.</span><br />
[11:29:05] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: sure RS gets after me for saying I wouldn't interfere in an interstellar war, but you are /helping/ people that are sure to make other people's lives a living hell.</span><br />
[11:29:06] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, you worked with some of Echidna's tech right? Helped me with a thing here and there too, you can probably figure this out right?</span><br />
[11:29:11] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I don't get it.</span><br />
[11:29:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm gonna assumed they're not the pillaging evil douchebag type of pirate</span><br />
[11:29:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're not, I just like calling them pirates.</span><br />
[11:29:47] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:29:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh so they're not even pirates at all?</span><br />
[11:29:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Lame</span><br />
[11:29:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I'm using Echidna's tech as a framework.</span><br />
[11:30:01] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Could've gone all space One Piece with it</span><br />
[11:30:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well they're kinda like...</span><br />
[11:30:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Pirates for hire.</span><br />
[11:30:15] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mercs?</span><br />
[11:30:18] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Thieves for hire?</span><br />
[11:30:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Bounty hunters, more like. And all the GOOD jobs are against assholes.</span><br />
[11:30:30] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Bounty hunters, right.</span><br />
[11:30:37] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...can't wait for two days from now.</span><br />
[11:30:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Firefly crew?</span><br />
[11:30:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So it's not as "rooty tooty point mcshooty" at everything with a pulse.</span><br />
[11:30:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey Charles what happens in two days?</span><br />
[11:30:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Never seen Firefly, is that what they were?</span><br />
[11:30:56] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think so</span><br />
[11:30:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: He shoots up the memo, duh.</span><br />
[11:31:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Neat.</span><br />
[11:31:00] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: check the calendar.</span><br />
[11:31:11] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: April Fools</span><br />
[11:31:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm really just doing this because the pilot is super cute and I swear I can impress her if I fix this.</span><br />
[11:31:27] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm quaking in my boots at what amazing pranks you'll come up with</span><br />
[11:32:09] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...is the pilot even human</span><br />
[11:32:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most of the crew is human.</span><br />
[11:32:24] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...Wait, I shouldn't even be one to talk.</span><br />
[11:33:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most of the crew is human and one of them looks like a human</span><br />
[11:34:18] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: I re▲lly hΘpe nΘne Θf yΘu h▲ve b▲d-t▲sting pr▲nks.</span><br />
[11:34:34] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am going to prank the bajesus out of people.</span><br />
[11:34:51] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: kinda amazed this universe has a ton of humans.</span><br />
[11:35:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Humans are a pretty fantastic species, I'm not suprised to see them all over.</span><br />
[11:36:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's a good template too biologically, so lots of humans and humanoid races isn't all that surprising.</span><br />
[11:36:16] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: like, seriously, with that logic, our old universe should have been filled with trolls.</span><br />
[11:36:19] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If it ain't broke right?</span><br />
[11:36:30] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Assuming our old universe was made by trolls.</span><br />
[11:37:38] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: It cΘuld be th▲t sΘmeΘne w▲nts tΘ h▲ve the feeling Θf h▲ving hum▲ns think Θf them ▲s ▲ gΘd.</span><br />
[11:37:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: lol</span><br />
[11:37:57] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I could see it for some people</span><br />
[11:38:00] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...yeah, with that logic, our universe would have been subjected to the miles... maybe it was, and we weren't there to see it.</span><br />
[11:38:22] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: If I fix this ship I'll totally be a god.</span><br />
[11:38:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...A god of repairs.</span><br />
[11:38:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: God this thing looks like a flux capacitor mixed with the deat star.</span><br />
[11:38:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: death*</span><br />

[11:39:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Heh.</span><br />
[11:39:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh right maybe /that/'s why there's so many awful species.</span><br />
[11:39:45] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Honestly. I kind of doubt it.</span><br />
[11:39:55] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:40:15] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe, but. She brought a bunch of frogs together.</span><br />
[11:40:22] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I am /so/ glad that Ash never visits us.</span><br />
[11:40:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: She's busy being a mother I think.</span><br />
[11:40:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: She also thought they were her children</span><br />
[11:40:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Chick has baby issues</span><br />

[11:44:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I accidentally hooked my arm around a cable and when I rolled I yanked it out and coolant started shooting everywhere</span><br />
[11:45:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it's just some kinda refrigerant, so probably nooot completely deadly</span><br />
[11:46:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Echidna tech spoiled me that stuff was beyond amazing.</span><br />

[12:03:16] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or that you'd die</span><br />
[12:03:23] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or maybe just faith nonspectacularly?</span><br />
