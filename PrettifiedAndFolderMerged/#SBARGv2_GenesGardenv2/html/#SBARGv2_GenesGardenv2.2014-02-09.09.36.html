<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure. like you said, all forcefields work by pushing back with equal force, and I dunno what kind of force 682 would've had... or worse, absorbing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: holy fuck how much energy do you have going to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, Copland has an infinite battery since I integrated a Golden Power Hub into it shortly before we left the session... but the power output rate isn't infinite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And eventually, my spin would start releasing more visible light radiation than I could build up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thus giving /me/ a limit too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, the shield can contain most kinds of conventional explosions and radiation to a point, but a nuke would probably overwhelm it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets hope we never have to find out that limit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at least we know the limit is /higher/ than a Chaos Dunk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my chaos dunk was not nearly as powerful as a true one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, all I had going for it was the kinetic energy of the meteor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: none of those anti b-ball protons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, what DT did was closer to a Chaos Dunk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...stronger than a ballistic meteor impact, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a release of temperatures nearly reaching 15 Thousand Kelvin.</span><br />
