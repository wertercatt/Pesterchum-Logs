<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because think about it, I was in the magicant, and I lost connection, and well, its logical.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus it used Swagger and Transform, then Heart Swap while manaphy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we know two of its moves as mew.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Chances are another one is Psychic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I still don't get why it would go "ooh this guy's got a blog let me post a thing" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... basically, as with all things lately, assume it is hostile and dangerous until proven otherwise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...yeah, that's probably a good assumption EQ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if it got in my head, it likely figured out the nature of its existance.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Um... good question, really. It sounds like Mewtwo doesnt wish to track via DNA-nes or whatever, so that means we just... have to narrow down the area of search. </span><br />
