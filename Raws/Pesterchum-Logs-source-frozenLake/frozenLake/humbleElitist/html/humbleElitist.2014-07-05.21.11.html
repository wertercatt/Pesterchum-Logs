[21:12:36] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Those two are the regexes to do it</span><br />
[21:12:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: If you wanna share with the dev chat at all</span><br />
[21:12:57] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* why aren't the perfect items on this? */</span><br />
[21:13:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: They are.</span><br />
[21:13:12] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ah, I don't actually know how to enter the dev chat */</span><br />
[21:13:14] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* oh */</span><br />
[21:13:25] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* oh there it is ok and then stuff. */</span><br />
[21:13:33] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Well, just pass on the message to EA I guess</span><br />
[21:13:37] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ok */</span><br />
[21:13:50] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* (I am not actually a dev, just to be clear) */</span><br />
[21:14:02] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Yeah, thats clear</span><br />
[21:14:02] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* (I just have op status for some reason, EA doesn't remember why) */</span><br />
[21:14:21] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ok */</span><br />
[21:14:29] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* will do. */</span><br />
[21:15:21] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* this list specifically is because of the possibility of having to change caledfwlch's code because of canon recipes? is that it? */</span><br />
[21:15:36] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Yes.</span><br />
[21:16:08] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: And thus, figure out what other items would need to follow in a chain.</span><br />
[21:16:25] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* what things it could make directly and what things make it */</span><br />
[21:16:34] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* or could make it directly */</span><br />
[21:16:37] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* hmm ok thats effecient */</span><br />
[21:17:38] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* hephaestus's tools seem very related */</span><br />
[21:17:50] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* that recipe would probably be best kept */</span><br />
[21:17:58] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Alright.</span><br />
[21:18:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: So we would likely need to adjust either that or the broken caledfwlch.</span><br />
[21:18:54] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* for the recipe with the cue ball? */</span><br />
[21:19:41] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* thats the one relating the two, right? */</span><br />
[21:19:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Broken Caledfwlch || Hephaestus's Tools = Caledfwlch</span><br />
[21:20:00] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: I know thats an intended recipe for sure to make it.</span><br />
[21:20:09] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ohok */</span><br />
[21:20:51] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* what was the canon recipe with the cue ball? */</span><br />
[21:21:22] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Broken Royal Deringer and Magic Cue Ball, the operation isn't specific.</span><br />
[21:21:42] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ah */</span><br />
[21:21:50] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* makes caledfwlch */</span><br />
[21:21:58] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* magic cue ball is an existing item right? and then stuff. */</span><br />
[21:22:08] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Yes, and used in /many/ recipes.</span><br />
[21:22:19] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* oh right */</span><br />
[21:22:21] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* right */</span><br />
[21:22:23] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* yeah */</span><br />
[21:22:23] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ok */</span><br />
[21:22:34] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* yeah that one won't be changed */</span><br />
[21:22:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: The royal deringer however, is not.</span><br />
[21:26:19] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* I forgot that dave said the line "DAVE: ...  DAVE: i need help :(" */</span><br />
[21:27:32] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ok .'. the broken royal deringer and the cue ball have to in some way make caledfwlch */</span><br />
[21:28:05] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* .'. that means that the cue ball combined with caledfwlch must make either the cue ball or caledfwlch */</span><br />
[21:28:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Correct.</span><br />
[21:28:48] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* and with caledfwlch's current code (based on that pastebin file) it currently is not? and then stuff. */</span><br />
[21:29:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Yes.</span><br />
[21:30:27] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* .'. the new code for caledfwlch must be changed .'. that it both fits with the cue ball and with the tools? */</span><br />
[21:30:31] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* wait, hm */</span><br />
[21:31:05] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* didn't Hephaestus's tools make the broken caledfwlch into the royal deringer though? */</span><br />
[21:31:40] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* although I suppose theres no way to represent the breaking again part */</span><br />
[21:35:58] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* is the code for hephaestus's tools used in anything? */</span><br />
[21:36:13] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: idk</span><br />
[21:36:49] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* do you know its code? */</span><br />
[21:36:58] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* could you run the regex for it? */</span><br />
[21:37:06] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* or would that take too long? */</span><br />
[21:37:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Hold on.</span><br />
[21:37:36] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* ok */</span><br />
