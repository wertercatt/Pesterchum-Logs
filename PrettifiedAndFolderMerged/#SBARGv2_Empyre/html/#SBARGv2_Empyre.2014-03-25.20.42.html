[08:43] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff520e">CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary [CPA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  chills on top of the biggest castle with the biggest flag on it because odds are that's the biggest and most obvious landmark. --</span><br />
[08:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals in at the front of the castle --</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks up, seeing PA, and flies up there --</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  slides down the side of the castle with her fire cushioning abilities, dusting herself off. --</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  -- or not --</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  i didn't read --</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ...or meets her down there --</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Hey Kim.</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup Adee.</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So we gotta find this cave, right?</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You got the magic space suits?</span><br />
[08:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah.</span><br />
[08:45] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  waves the menu modus open, and scrolls through until he finds and deploys a suit, then wardrobifies into his own --</span><br />
[08:45] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: How do I...put it on?</span><br />
[08:45] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What even /is/ this?</span><br />
[08:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's a space suit. basically self-contained life support to keep us safe from the vacuum of space... or in this case, poisonous volcanic gas.</span><br />
[08:48] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Wish I had a magic backpack that didn't exist.</span><br />
[08:48] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Or the power to instantly change clothes.</span><br />
[08:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dang, you're right. hold on, I'll show you how to get into it...</span><br />
[08:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unequips his normal suit, changes to human form, deploys the other human-shaped suit that was originally meant for MP, and slowly demonstrates how to get yourself into it --</span><br />
[08:50] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Oooh alright.</span><br />
[08:50] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  follows suit, getting into her space...suit. She keeps the helmet off for now because she ain't looking like a dork. --</span><br />
[08:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... it's definitely one of the dumber-looking types of clothing, but function over form I guess.</span><br />
[08:51] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah I guess.</span><br />
[08:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, where's this place you found the bears going into?</span><br />
[08:52] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's a little bit away.</span><br />
[08:52] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I'm gonna ride Bolster, you could probably do.</span><br />
[08:52] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Whatever it is Kim's do to fly.</span><br />
[08:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk.</span><br />
[08:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  decides not to do GT-flying this time, and just pulls out a Zipboard, which he actually looks decent riding in bipedal form --</span><br />
[08:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  whistles and a torrent of flame shoots from one of the windows before a somewhat small dragon comes crawling up to the rooftop, definitely big enough for Adeela to ride alone though. --</span><br />
[08:54] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: See the mountain line over...there?</span><br />
[08:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... yeah, I see it.</span><br />
[08:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  points towards some mountains a little bit away to the East. --</span><br />
[08:54] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's nestled right in there, big crack.</span><br />
[08:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sweet.</span><br />
[08:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, after you...</span><br />
[08:56] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Oh yeah, right.</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  climbs aboard the dragon, clinging to its back and bonking it on the head lightly. It looks at her like ???? before she points to the mountains, it lazily taking off towards where she pointed. --</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  leans forward on the zipboard and takes off after them, matching speed and riding alongside --</span><br />
[09:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  i am super busy just gimme one minute --</span><br />
[09:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  totes understandable, I'm multitasking too ;) --</span><br />
[09:09] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  flies her way to the mountainside, bonking the green scaled dragon and pointing for it to land on the side of the mountain, waiting for Kim to land as well. There's a few bears nearby that give PA a curious look, a cave nearby that's spitting out a few tendrils of smoke. --</span><br />
[09:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  lands next to them and puts the zipboard away --</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That's the cave.</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, it's certainly ominous enough...</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, so how far did you get inside before you had to turn back because of the gas?</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, but with these suit things we'll be fine.</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Oh uh...I got pretty far.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: There's a point where you gotta go slow, and I didn't want to go through slow with that gas.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, the suits have toxic-environment sensors, so when they start sounding the alarm, that's when we gotta put the helmets up.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Oh, kay.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  motions for PA to go first --</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah yeah send the canary first..</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, you know the way since you were here before...</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Oh yeah.</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  walks into the cave, waving for CP to follow. The cave is dark, unvinviting, and uncomfortably hot for somebody like CP at least. The cave seems to shoot straight down into a tunnel, the gas builds up and it is slightly poisonous, wouldn't be suprised if the alarm starts sounding on the suits. --</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows, his helmet up as soon as he smells the gas --</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  puts her helmet up as well, looking around the dark tunnel and feeling her way along the walls for a hole in the wall that seems darker than the environment around, thick plumes of gas coming from the crack. Adeela points to that. --</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: this the place you turned back at last time?</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah.</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: This one right here.</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: The bears make it through though.</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe they have a natural resistance to the gas somehow...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, here we go...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  cautiously enters the hole in the wall --</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  The hole leads downwards...doooown, down into a dark depth, hope you have a light. The pathway gets slippery after a while, the rocks not very good points to hold onto. --</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  turns on the helmet lights and continues, being careful where he steps --</span><br />
[09:32] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  follows along, blinking and trying to figure out how to turn the helmet lights on. The pathway eventually levels out into a central chamber of sorts. --</span><br />
[09:32] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  points out the button on the chest control panel, then looks around the chamber --</span><br />
[09:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  clicks the button, looking around. The gas seems to have stopped completely, leaving them in an echoey kind of chamber. All across the ground are small little points coming up from the rock, some of them lit up with small little flames, looking like they follow some sort of pattern. --</span><br />
[09:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ooh... now this looks important.</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  tries to make sense of the pattern --</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  it's a circle, boss. --</span><br />
[09:39] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  durr --</span><br />
[09:39] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  it actually looks more like a spiral going one way, then the other, a small pathway leading to the center. It looks almost like a stone kind of yin-yang symbol. --</span><br />
[09:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what do you think we're supposed to do with the circle of fire? besides stand in the middle of it, obviously?</span><br />
[09:40] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Light the rest of them.</span><br />
[09:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay... well, I said I wasn't gonna use my brush abilities for any of this, so I guess I'm transferring the fire with a piece of wood.</span><br />
[09:42] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  uncaptchas one he just happened to have, and starts doing so --</span><br />
[09:43] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I'll do it, I'll do it.</span><br />
[09:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, okay.</span><br />
[09:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stands back and lets her do it --</span><br />
[09:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  takes the helmet off, then her suit, rubbing her hands to spark a flame, flicking it onto the piece of wood. --</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ...oh wait, you meant you'd light the wood, and then I'd spread the flame. gotcha. *does so* --</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  puts her hands together, pulling them apart and producing a whip of fire in her hand, crouching down and swinging it cross to light half the circle in a motion. --</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  finishes lighting the other half of the circle, then walks back to the middle --</span><br />
[09:48] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[09:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  walks back to the middle, sitting down and looking around the circle. The whole chamber is lit up with an eerie light, dead silent. --</span><br />
[09:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows suit with the sitting down --</span><br />
[09:50] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  Seems like things are moving just outside of the rim of the fire. Like a campfire except below a mountain filled with poisonous gas. --</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  tries to figure out what the movement is --</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  SPOOPY GHOSTS --</span><br />
[09:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  figured as much --</span><br />
[09:54] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: If you were a bear.</span><br />
[09:54] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What would you be doin right now.</span><br />
[09:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... trying to greet the ghosts? I dunno.</span><br />
[09:55] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I.</span><br />
[09:56] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Uh.</span><br />
[09:56] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Fuck</span><br />
[09:57] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: How do you greet ghosts.</span><br />
[09:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...neither of us thought this through, huh.</span><br />
[09:57] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Maybe we just gotta like</span><br />
[09:57] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Try and enter the spirit world or something.</span><br />
[09:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess? but how...</span><br />
[09:58] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Very carefully.</span><br />
[09:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[10:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues drawing a blank on how to do that --</span><br />
[10:01] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: ...Hit me in the head with a plank of wood.</span><br />
[10:01] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Maybe I'll wake up in the spirit world.</span><br />
[10:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I got a better idea. sit back-to-back with me.</span><br />
[10:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  waves his fetch modus open, looking for the Tome of Knockouts --</span><br />

[10:04] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  sits back to back, nodding. --</span><br />

[10:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...welp, that worked.</span><br />

[10:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks around a bit, trying to see if there's any obvious paths --</span><br />
[10:18] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  There's only a semi obvious path through the underbrush that leads into water, there's roots of a tree that wind around that might just be a bridge. --</span><br />
[10:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, guess this is the only likely path...</span><br />
[10:19] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts heading that way --</span><br />

[10:19] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  walks that way, trying to use a small flame jump to get herself onto the bridge. It fails and she ends up falling on her face. --</span><br />

[10:23] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  hops onto the tree and walks like a normal person. The water below them is murky and begins to look far deeper, mist gathering around them as the trees fade away. Now there's just them walking along a long root and water below. Hope you can swim. --</span><br />
[10:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks at the deep water, shrugs, and keeps walking carefully along the root --</span><br />
[10:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  Something massive swims below the root, appearing only as a shadow before sinking down again, the root twisting and going up. --</span><br />

[10:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: now that is a big tree.</span><br />
[10:30] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Woah..</span><br />
[10:31] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  The tree has a large island circling around it, the roots reaching throughout it like a maze of tendrils shooting out to every end of the world. --</span><br />
[10:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pretty obvious this is the center of the spirit world, or at least this part of it...</span><br />
[10:33] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Maybe everything in the spirit world looks like this.</span><br />
[10:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[10:34] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Iunno man.</span><br />
[10:34] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: ...I still don't know where to find the lion turtles.</span><br />
[10:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, if that giant shadow in the water was any indication, we're in the right area.</span><br />
[10:35] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, definitely..</span><br />
[10:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  shakes her head clear, clambering her way across the root onto the island, leaning against the root. --</span><br />
[10:36] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also gets over there and looks around --</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Fuck.</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what?</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I just</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Have no idea how to find these things.</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I don't have the faintest idea.</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, we made it this far, and I'm not sure if we're making it out on our own since we have neither powers nor sylladexes...</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: FUCK.</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe we have to wait for them to come to us?</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That's a good idea I guess.</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  pulls herself up onto a root, sitting down and staring off into the mist. --</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sits and continues waiting --</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: ...I don't know what we're waiting for.</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe... maybe they're trying to teach us patience? and when we accept it, then they'll show themselves?</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  sighs, sitting indian-style and resting her hands on her knees. --</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Might as well practice breathing.</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: true.</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Just...meditate and all that.</span><br />
[10:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts calming himself and focusing on relaxed breathing --</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix_MwKHgD8k'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix_MwKHgD8k</a> durr theme music --</span><br />
[10:48] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Maybe we're just entitled thinking a lion turtle would come to us.</span><br />
[10:48] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //half-expected elevatorstuck, pleasantly surprised --</span><br />
[10:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........maybe... the reason the bears have no trouble with coming here is, they don't have human feelings like entitlement...</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: ..Yeah.</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Maybe that's why they learned it so fast.</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's about the only explanation that makes sense, at this point.</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So we remove our entitlement.</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: We find like, inner peace.</span><br />
[10:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  stands and positions herself on a root hanging over the water, sitting down in the same manner and closing her eyes. --</span><br />
[10:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  remains sitting where he is on the root, and also meditates --</span><br />
[10:56] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I wouldn't expect anything like a spirit to show up for us.</span><br />
[10:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[10:58] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I mean, hell. You're here to learn more powers, and me? I don't know why I'm here.</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe you came to make sure I wouldn't get killed trying to get here? ...ignoring the usual meaninglessness of death for those like me...</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, maybe.</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I... yeah, that's pretty much the only reason I'm here, to learn more powers...</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You don't even really know what it means to firebend, do you.</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I thought I had a decent answer, but now I'm not so sure...</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Do you want me to just tell you?</span><br />
[11:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I guess... since I'm not sure if I'd ever figure it out on my own...</span><br />
[11:06] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Firebending... it means more than just using power to burn things and light them on fire, it means more than turning motion to burning.</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: To use firebending is to use the most ancient source of power us humans have, our passion, our spirit. Then we turn that into an extension of ourselves.</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: People are just fire in a body, and firebending is to release that fire to accomplish whatever we want.</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's the most human element of all of them, did you know?</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's the element of power, and gathering the power humans have. People learn firebending, Fi wanted to learn firebending, to better understand the power us humans have.</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: If you just want another card to your deck, that's not going to fly.</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh... guess I actually didn't think of it that way. I knew it was the only one of the four elements that is created and destroyed by man, but...</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's the only one that means life and death at the same time.</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... life for staying warm, and death for burning.</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: No, no man.</span><br />
[11:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
[11:12] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's more than just staying warm and burning.</span><br />
[11:13] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Fire is comfort and creativity, industry and life. It's only death when our fires go out or when we stop being able to control it.</span><br />
[11:14] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: If fire isn't controlled, it consumes and consumes. Firebending is the only element that we control, and don't direct.</span><br />
[11:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  slowly nods in understanding --</span><br />
[11:15] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You gotta... think about things deeper than you do.</span><br />
[11:16] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Fire is dragged up, you have to dig deep to find it.</span><br />
[11:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...maybe the reason the turtles haven't shown themselves is because I didn't know the true meaning of firebending yet...</span><br />
[11:20] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably.</span><br />
[11:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, thank you for telling me. I'll try my best to understand it and keep it in mind, even when I'm doing other things...</span><br />
[11:22] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, good.</span><br />
[11:23] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I think I'm going to be patient and wait here.</span><br />
[11:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and since there's really nothing else we can do right now, I'll also keep waiting.</span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { I'm gonna go to bed, so I'll catch you tomorrow }</span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so, are we staying here overnight?))</span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { Unless CP leaves, yeah </span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { PA is for sure }</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, since he doesn't know /how/ to leave...))</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { lol }</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((are you gonna be online tomorrow morning, or do you have work/school/something else?))</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { I'll be on at like 11:00 central }</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((cool. that's 9am my time which is when I wake up :P))</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { sic }</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: { alright I'm outta here, peace }</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((night))</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CPA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
