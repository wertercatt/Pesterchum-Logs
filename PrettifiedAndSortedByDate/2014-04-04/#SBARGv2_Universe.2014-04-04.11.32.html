[12:13:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
[12:17:07] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I mean, I would have lost track of the small nations that would have popped up in your borders by now.</span><br />
[12:18:29] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah I haven't yet.</span><br />

[12:28:18] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Not the best.</span><br />
[12:35:43] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Question. If one cannot learn firebending, is there a way to see if they are compatable with one of the other types of bending?</span><br />
[12:36:39] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: No.</span><br />
[12:36:53] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Kim had to give something to a spirit to even get the chance to learn it.</span><br />
[12:37:36] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So no ways to check compatibility?</span><br />
[12:38:37] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, but not for you.</span><br />
[12:39:06] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: :|</span><br />
[12:48:01] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...come to think about it, you may have a point.</span><br />
[12:48:35] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I'm far too chaotic and impatient to learn /any/ form of bending.</span><br />
[12:48:54] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Plus you kinda just ruin things.</span><br />
[12:49:06] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: And bending's a martial art, lotta strength on the 'art' part.</span><br />
[12:49:54] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I mean, I could likely figure out a way to fake bending... but that just doesn't seem right.</span><br />
[12:50:42] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah it's not.</span><br />
[12:51:04] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Bug spray and lighters.</span><br />

[12:55:52] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...though, your fire bending does raise some interesting questions.</span><br />
[12:56:03] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: For example, how hot can you make your flames?</span><br />
[12:56:20] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Pretty hot.</span><br />
[12:56:35] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I've made 'em hot enough to melt rocks once or twice.</span><br />

[12:56:53] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: not nearly hot enough</span><br />
[12:57:33] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's definitely hot enough</span><br />
[12:57:48] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: 100 Million Kelvin</span><br />
