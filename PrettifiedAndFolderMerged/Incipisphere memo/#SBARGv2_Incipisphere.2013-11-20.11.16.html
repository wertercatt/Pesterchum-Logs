<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doubt it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats... something that points away from Mewtwo being responsible.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: MEGA EVOLUTION ISN'T EVEN POSSIBLE IN RED AND BLUE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that means he'd have to have a trainer that's bonded a lot with him or something like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or he can do it alone like in the anime.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...though to be honest, I didn't really give up a good fight after he mega evolved into Mega Mewtwo X.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He kicked me across the cave.</span><br />
