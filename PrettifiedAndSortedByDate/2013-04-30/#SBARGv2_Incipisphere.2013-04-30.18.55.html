<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Good luck gals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#970025">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: He knows not all of us are girls right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Or does he just not care?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Close your eyes and it's mostly the same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its text, how can one tell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other than ASL, that is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But even then, people can still lie!</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: shruuuuug</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyway, I got most of the way through kingdom valley before I got a game over and lost my progress on the trials.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So... god I hate this game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: You might be more masochistic then me, or maybe just more well funded</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Putting yourself voluntarily through /that/ game which shall not be named for the sake of any children in the area</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sonic 06. It is horrible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((afk, IC asleep in room))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that is only a nickname for it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know another nickname for it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SONIC.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ADVENTURE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Never heard anyone refer to it as such</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I kind of liked that game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Although... Yeah that does make sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I beat it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Clement refered to it as such.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Overworld, different musical themes for different areas in levels...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Great Clement?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And NV, you are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I beat it as well, but looking back on it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: HORRIBAD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've never really hated a sonic game</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or any game</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like things</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Not even...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: /Dark Souls/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: hehehehehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Too bad the save data was lost when an imp trashed my stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#5c315c">CURRENT melodiousPsyche [CMP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Hahahahaha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I haven't played Dark Souls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have played the Ikaruga demo, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like Dark Souls too</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I loathe playing it but I like the challenge when I do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sonic 06 isn't a challenge. Its a hell upon itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Too bad I want one of the items from it, huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Get the chaos emeralds *O*!</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Find the computer room, herp derp</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, not either of those.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the Sky blue skill gem I need.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one you throw that sends you FLYING?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: The one that lets you break the game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I want to make it so I can break THIS game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff660d">CURRENT squealingVermin [CSV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I've been thinking about breaking the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Given the current glitches I'd say it's possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: But if the system would be stable, wouldn't it just be the intention of the game itself to get broken?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: sure you wanna do that? it'd be like causing the matrix to bluescreen, in a way...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Ha...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Whadaya mean break the game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nobody just wants to play it legit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I mean, it's cleverly working around the system of the game itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Nico</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I've been reading up on several theory books in the prospit royal library.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: This game is the most nintendo hard mess of guide dang its and lost forevers that ever protruded its unfair ass in anyone's face</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Gotta even up the score /somehow/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I suppose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I've read up on fate theory last night.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Fate theory?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: It's most interesting, and a fine example of what I'd find gamebreaking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah but I've been playing it legit! It's like hardcore mode in Fallout! It's fun as shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Explain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We're transported into this session, which makes us simply part of the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Look, This is more me working around the rules.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: The code plays us like a game, whilst we play the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Are you following me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Mind-boggling</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: But yeah I got you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, managing to create a device to launch yourself into space without noclip in garrys mod.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Using the ingame physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: It's programmed into the session that everyone, along time, will at some point eventually die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This is the programmed fate we're to face.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Of course, the game is immersive to such extent that even the code set up for FATE itself can be manipulated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: In the end, it is us playing the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: But at the same time, it plays against us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Are you saying we should start making gamesharks?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: In a way, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But what if it's in the code for you to do that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: But within the boundries of what we're given.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What if it knows you better than YOU know you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This is trippy shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I know right!</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: While we're playing the game, its playing us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would assume that it is a 3rd level player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd like to see this game try to outstupid me!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: You'll probably die in a most ironic way NV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except in this case, skaia is an x+1 player, where x is the level your playing at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Like... an RPG, sorta. It routes us along but we carry on the path /we/ would, and it ends up more an escort along for the right</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Or maybe the other way around...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Indeed RS. You've got it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This is what time players must also understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Like... There are things we can accomplish but the rough concept of the journey's already laid out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So you're telling me the game was prepared for me to stare at a rock  for 10 minutes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: But at the same time, it was not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: That's not to say we don't have any choice in the matter, its just within certain confines that we have to keep to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you saying we should defeat giygas... without praying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: if you want to go that way, First Guardian is the GM and Skaia wrote the sourcebooks, but unicode-corrupted them and FG's manually decrypting them</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Which, considerign the kind of game it is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Think about what we can do</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Manipulate our minds and hearts, the most basic fabrics of reality...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, what we really need to do is be huge munchkins.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: It is stunning, is it not RS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So you're telling me that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: The bonds between us or the life that flows through us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's all made up, and the deaths don't matter?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh... no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: It does.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Those confines are actually pretty damn far-reaching...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you die, YOUR DEAD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV:  I second FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKaQPkq6Ypw'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKaQPkq6Ypw</a> )</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well if you're scripted to die, then you die, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Correct, but the script is immersive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Death is just the beginning in this game, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And changed with every step we make</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: like a game of chess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This means that the eventual fate can be delayed if you are aware of what you are doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, who wants to die from OLD AGE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ME, ME</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: In any way, fate is unavoidable. It is the true code bound to every player from the moment they enter the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it says we all die, then we make it so we die from old age.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Correct.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Maybe... But then what determines that fate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: But then again, time is also avoidable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: In the end its up to everything we do, and every choice we make...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Every path we go down, forsaking another...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm going to be me and stuff everything that says otherwise</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, this rules out god tier, because they can't die from anything but a heroic or just death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Our decisions determine fate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It takes way too long to give a shit about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Hehehehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Dork.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say we just start kicking apart the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sounds like a plan, where do we start?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Which is exactly what we need to do, but with a good thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Look, the code skaia has for the session has a "limit", right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We need more brain than brawn in this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After that, you go into horror terror land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: To what you said, SV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Maybe, maybe not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THE ENTIRE MULTIVERSE IS A SIMULATION.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I'd advise you all to read up in your respective royal libraries as your dreamselves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: My personal philosophy is "Always be as smart or stupid as you need to be"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This is the worse case scenario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, it gets worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have a lot of personal philosphies and they all get progressively more forrest gump</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: NV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yes sir</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: That was the dumbest yet most genius thing I've heard in a while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Thank you SIR</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: A clap for the idiot savant</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Ahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And please, don't call me a sir.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm saluting you, but you can't see it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yes MA'AM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Pfft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh hey this salute gave me an idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_LoHaN'>#SBARGv2_LoHaN</a> - Active SJ's planet memo ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If this succeeds I'm going to be a happy camper</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Happy adventurer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what did I miss</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Fate theory 101.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: even with time travel, the multiverse is self-consistent to a point. This may be it ajdusting time travels to unless nothing is dirastically changed, It goes back to the "true" state.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: More or less</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Fate theory 102</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: There is no fate that can't be denied with enough firepower</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: And associate willpower</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: but mostly firepower</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, this means that the universe is not turing compatable, unless... okay, my head hurts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, skaia perfers certain versions of time lines over others, and destroys entire universes to get its way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, now I hate this game even more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: That's kinda much it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its a bratty child who has managed to become lord of the multiverse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And were saying we should over throw it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Good going, you just made me go insane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'M KING OF EVERYTHING.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But not that far.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have a frog the size of a large horse now</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am a very very happy camper</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Stylish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's give it a jetpack</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, back to 06.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I've found an endgame recipy for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, what was that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This shovel must be hella-overpowered.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fear the rat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I know about the FEAR combo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I don't think that's what he was even going for</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But anyway, I think there may be some imps still around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, one just managed to FUCKING BACKSTAB ME.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: alchemize a razorback and a rocketlauncherkind jarate dispenser? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll make 10 more focus sashes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i feel like noτ moving from τhis spoτ forever, excepτ noτ really</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i am τhaτ τired</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Good kinda tired to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Means sleep'll come easy, y'know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Somehow, I've managed to stack the effects... sort of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now I just need a health regen item.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Take a nap, get some shut-eye. Or...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, this should work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, the only thing that would be able to kill be is 10 shots in a row that manage to over come the health regen...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically I can take a nuclear blast if its "coded" as one hit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: TT, where are you at?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_LoHaN'>#SBARGv2_LoHaN</a> - Active SJ's planet memo ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: being a non-moving slug in SJ's house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: what a coincidence i was being the exact same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: except /on/, not in</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: man, to /hell/ with that dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: also to hell with bumming around for no good reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i'm sτill τhinking over if i should even wanτ τo remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: iτ's complicaτed</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, since the backstab is only one hit that deals 400% the targets max hp... the focus sashes should work. I mean, they have worked twice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: how long does it take a focus sash to "reset"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...no clue</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, for this, It seems to be when one is outside of a battle...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So when one uses a return node?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or Gate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As, you are not in battle for the period of time your traveling...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I'd say the time between "STRIFE!" appearing and the victory dance is the "battle period", and everything else is outside of battle...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: at least that's how I interpret it</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Usually when you crouch and it says [HIDDEN] you're out of battle</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anytime you gain EXP? ...actually, I'm not sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I'll try not to get hit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I really fucking hate spy imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, RS, is that you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Coming torward me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Pretty sure no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ?_?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, yeah, that WAS an imp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i wonder if you guys are going τo acτually go find τhaτ grisτ someday</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: What the hell kin-</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: spy imp?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: gdi</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Spy imp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: who thought a TF2 prototype was a good idea godamn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would recomend everyone exits the base so I may purge the site.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I'm over by Niki's place</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: So no worries there</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Hm.. You might want to acquire sadviches and pancakes to deal with heavies and scout imps then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suggest we lock down the base.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's better than the underlings resulting from my plush ammy toy prototyping. three words: Ice Lips Giclops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe it is only the spys remaining, as they have not appeared on my radar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gotta love the watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean it does EVERYTHING! except tell time, that is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: which get automatic Super Effective bonus from matching my planet's type (snow/ice)... fortunately, it also means 2x weakness to fire-type attacks</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is there a sprinkler system I could feed food coloring through?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wanna make SURE I'm taking out the imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a8a87e">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Heya, what did I miss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I don't have a sprinkler, but for the jarate component (auto Super Effective against invisible underlings, TF2-protoed or not), use Saxton Hale Comic &amp;&amp; Apple Juice</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I don't wanna cover everything in piss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...and suddenly, I don't wanna know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ok then, Paint Can (any color) || Water Bottle = Food Coloring (color of component paint)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have the food coloring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FF: FL's got a Spy Imp infestation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Over at the base.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: oh okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There are still some left over it seems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: welp, I got nothing then :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: The sultion is simple. BURN IT ALL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, its not my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...then rebild it later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its not my stuff in here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I have ONE ROOM, but everything else...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: A case of spycrabs are a terrible thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: But seriousyl, just make goggles that can identfiy the monsters and pierce their claock.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Does anybody have a cowboy hat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't think that exists in tf2.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: and? You are not LIMITED to team fortress two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Damn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I'm not sure if it would work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: I don't sorry NV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I look cool enough riding my noble steed with this armour</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Any who whats up with SJ and TT and ja others?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, maybe I can make some googles of true seeing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...not the best of ideas. You might see the truth of EVERYTHING.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True Seeing from DND.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: How about a EMP based weapon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Should knock out spy powers, because it's based on eletricity... It hink.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That may not work well for spys who are basically wearing a cardboard mask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And yet we somehow see as the person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You should just get a lot of flamethrower turrets</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ..r.ight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, TT? You want me to take NV's advice and set your house on fire to take care of a few invisible imps?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: NO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: NΘ</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Just use a laser pointer, or heat vision.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats what I thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll make the true seeing goggles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Should see through the masks too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, so, 250 Amber, 25 gold, and one diamond.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seems a fair price to pay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why not invest in locks for your doors</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The code is UTJ?VoSU, if your gonna use it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And they aren't MY DOORS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You should put locks on the door for whoevers house it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...uh, then how would THEY get in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Good question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Give them keys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't think you understand how simple locks can be</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, you expect me to manage to give someone keys to their own house, when I have no idea where they might be, and the only place I could meet up with them is in the house that was just LOCKED?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or are from a really good neighborhood</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I think you've managed to outclass FI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, alright, make some keys, lock the doors, then put the key in somewhere you can agree on, like under a rock, or under the doormat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I tried that once,</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't know who FI is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The imps broke the windows.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: All the windows?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is less property damage from the imps if you leave the doors unlocked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, just the ones on the ground floor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you could like, armour up the house</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The house has TURRETS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You put turrets in the house but not locks?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS NOT MY FUCKING HOUSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TT, please. Make this guy understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Whoa there partner, I don't mean to make you mad</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ is he τrying τo do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even if its just smashing something against his head.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i swear if you're seττing my planeτ on fire I WILL KILL YΘU</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He's trying to convince me to add locks to the base and thus lock EVERYONE out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Calm yourself, I'm saying if imps are such a problem, why not try and keep them out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhere, elsey will τake care of anyτhing.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: *everyτhing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I just made some goggles of true seeing, so I'll take out the imps I can find.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it looks like I'm attacking another player, Its the goggles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless I am not wearing them, in which case it is a spy imp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: you don'τ have τo worry abouτ τhose τhings, my spriτe has ways of making τhings beττer. she surprises even me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Finally something that makes sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am proud of your sprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...you mean your sprite could have helped us take out INVISIBLE IMPS, which can also cloak as US.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I retract my previous statement, but I hope that in the future it impresses me even more</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, why didn't she.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Issue didn't get brought up</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: you didn'τ ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: she τends τo be very...capricious someτimes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, I'll ask the sprite to help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Always ask these questions man, otherwise imps keep breaking in! Ask the sprite to reinforce the windows too</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: musτ be a wiτch τhing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: iτ'll τake a while, buτ she'll guaranτee τhaτ τhe base will be spy-proof when she's finished.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Got her to help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Awesome! See collaborative thinking helps. And asking sprites to do things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now to finally get back to 06- ...IIIIIIIMMMMMMMPPPPPPSSSSS!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Congradulations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have just had to deal with IMP based POWER LOST.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And, by power lost, I mean they thought that the power cable was a target to backstab.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NOW I NEED TO DO KINGDOM VALLEY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AGAIN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: didn't you say that game has autosave?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, it doesn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: she did say τhaτ she'll τake a while unu</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, only after the stages.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: wait, I thought the magic power and internet of the incipisphere was explicitly not reliant on physical connections?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But not in the middle of them, or after missions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it seems that while main power wires maintain connection, lower voltages do not...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good night.</span><br />
