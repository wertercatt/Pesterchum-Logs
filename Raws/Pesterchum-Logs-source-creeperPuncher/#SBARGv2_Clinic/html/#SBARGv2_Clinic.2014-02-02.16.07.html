<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Yeah... thats a good idea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: So... why are you classified as a demon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: SDs are incredibly sturdy beings. We have enhanced eye sight, powerful limbs, amazing sense of smell and hearing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: We are used for deep space exploration and testing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: But some how earned the demon part from our earlier tests.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: There were plenty of casualties in our creation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ouch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...and it would not be wise to fight us eaither. Unless you want to feel what its like to suddenly be missing a limb to powerful jaws.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  sighs --</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: That fucking sucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sounds like some of the sorts around /there/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Synthetic Creatues of science are tricky to classify.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: We are more of tools than say, a random stray dog or cat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Tools with minds of our own and are aware of what we are. Held on a leash that states we might die if we stray from the mission at hand.</span><br />
