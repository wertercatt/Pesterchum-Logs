[01:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, we're planning a kind of post-game story thing, and we wanted to invite Ben (slothfulLunchmeat), but NN was like "no. he's permabaNNed from v2, and either you drop him or drop our setting."))</span><br />
[01:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((even though no one owns v2, legally speaking. it's a fanfic of a fanfic, so copyright /cannot/ be claimed on it))</span><br />
[01:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but basically, we're saying "fuck you" and doing our own thing that starts in v2, but goes outside of it and will have a different set of memos and stuff))</span><br />

[01:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((which reminds me: NN, Ash (FA), and Kaylen (SG/PT) do not know about this, and we want it to stay that way.))</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((Sorry. Them. Very sorry.))</span><br />
