[10:05] <span style="color:#000000">GK: Hi! This is a message from <a href='@ghostDunk'>@ghostDunk</a> ! I'm starting a new project based on my old code base to make an all-purpose chat client that will be able to support ANY fandom style chat, and I'm making a Kickstarter to support it! I want to make the client better and less buggy, a better Mac version, make mobile clients, and rewrite the server for more features! We also have a stretch goal to make a web version and browser plugin!</span><br />
