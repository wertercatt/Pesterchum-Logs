<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have figured out to read the files on the crystals in a raw file format.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :o ? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I do not know the contents of the files, as I can only read Ascii text (which thankfully seems to be a universal standard) and any ascii that shows up in the files.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And judging from the filenames on the one crystal I damaged... I did you all a favor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you actually wanted to look at what might be videos and images.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But by the file names, I doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But right now, I can only read txt files.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As I have no idea whats in the other files.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but this crystal seems to have alien porn on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ............ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm thinking I should break it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets just hope the other 58 have other stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: <span style="color:#a15000">wHAT,</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Each one of these crystals hold an exabyte of information.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the storage seems to be as compact as it can get at the atomic level.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, with rewritable storage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I was about to ask how compact it can freaking get...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So these are... pretty small crystals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, one atom per bit /not including/ the stuff for how to access and change the data</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'd love to see the alien species that designed these.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Fully replicateable as well, but it wipes the storage clean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I just found a crystal that has the design of the crystal on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...These were made by aliens that advocate open source.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I.... I think I'm in love.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, maybe it was just that particular group? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but /open source exists here/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just saying, blanket statements are hard to take seriously when we only have a couple pieces of the puzzle. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The alien that invented it is likely long gone by now... this is r24483292</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: revision.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So aliens must have been /upgrading these/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Aliens that believe in open source... Man, I'm gonna need to debrief that consort if I find him again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Find out where he picked it up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we might have some pretty advanced civilizations out here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is the bar still open? I'm gonna give an empty one to IB.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since its better than my last present by a /long shot/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And much more stable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, pretty sure it is. ((IB is afk though I think)) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Crystal storage is much better than a computer that runs off of a black hole and sends messages to itself from the future using it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yes to both statements afaik))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o-O ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well how /else/ did you think I cracked P=NP</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, sounds like the backstory beyond "Hacker Evolution". they discovered FTL message sending, eventually spacetime started cracking and messages were going backassward in time, huge processing power resulted until an AI happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *behind</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is full of miswording today --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, could you set up a public warp mod?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For the Minecraft Server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's probably a good idea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, since us normal users can only make a single warp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, /home</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk if I'm doing the server today though, I have other things I need to do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also FL, I thought you said named /homes were working...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me Zip up a mod pack</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, I never said that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We figured out it was working for /admins/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or at least someone did</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Admins can /sethome with names</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and yet, when I tested that one time where I had SJ temp-deop me, it still worked while I was deopped.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, but did you try to make any new /home at that time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or did you just warp between the ones already set?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: new one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats odd...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So basically I'm the only one that has an issue with /sethome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, setting up my server, let me zip up a modpack... you will need to get Forge and maybe Optifine loaded in the jar yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not in the mood for minecraft today. ((so many things to get done that I completely slacked off of yesterday @ _@)) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((same here, that's why I'm not hosting today))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, how did you set it to extralarge?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um... one sec</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &lt;server_dir&gt;\server.properties, set level-type=LARGEBIOMES</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: all caps, all one word</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, FL's planning on hosting a modded server soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also don't forget to set pvp=false</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, isn't that generator settings?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hold on, I'll just do the wiki</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: server.properties is /all/ the vanilla settings, not just terraingen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I think if you change the terraingen settings when a map already exists, it /might/ start using the new ones for new chunks... idk if the seed and settings are saved with the map itself in SMP like it is in singleplayer</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: announce-player-achievements=FALSE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: difficulty... fuck it, 2.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's... not even a setting. are you sure you have the 1.6.4 server.jar?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (the achievements thing I mean)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not there, but I'm adding it to be sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: missing settings are added automatically. that's also how mods and stuff work</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh you are going to /love/ the MOTD</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, I might play tomorrow... bit busy today</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would someone kindly test this with me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...eh, I guess I could for a bit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I'll get the mods folder dropboxed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... I just instance a clean 1.6.4.jar, do the switchy-aroundy stuff, dump all the mods into the jar, and I'm good?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *well, Forge, then OptiFine, then the other mods, but basically that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just do Forge and Optifine in the jar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the rest goes in a mods folder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Minecraft Forge is awesome like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I always install into the jar itself, even /with/ Forge...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its easier to do the mods folder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is the only thing contained in this zip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/yv5bemoxfnusz5c/mods.zip'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/yv5bemoxfnusz5c/mods.zip</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: just drop the mods folder in there in the location where you have the minecraft loading from (with the official launcher)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll pester you the IP</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since I don't want everyone hopping on right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sorry, had to use the bathroom. gonna set up the thing now then))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I still wonder why you and a few others aren't being given dl.dropboxusercontent.com urls for that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would you like me to try to get it that way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah, it's a simple conversion</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm just wondering why that method /isn't available/ in newer versions of DB....</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh-oh. I don't know what version of Forge I have to use... or rather, what version has to be used with my version of OF...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Recommended forge version for 1.6.4</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, digging for it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: 9.11.1 for 1.6.4?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of... starts dumping everything into 1.6.4-flserver.jar, one thing at a time --</span><br />
