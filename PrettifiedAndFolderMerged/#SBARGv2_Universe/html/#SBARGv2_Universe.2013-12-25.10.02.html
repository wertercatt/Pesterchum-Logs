[12:26:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is also quite likely that his weaponry is powered by Chaos Drives.</span><br />
[12:27:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And considering they contain power collected from chaos emeralds, it is likely if he has enough, he can simulate the effects of the fake emerald in Sonic Adventure 2.</span><br />
[12:28:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would likely take seven to match it though.</span><br />
[12:28:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if he has enough... well, thats how I knew the super form was coming.</span><br />
[12:28:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes...</span><br />
[12:28:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, due to the fact the power is limited, he would not be able to maintain it for any period of time.</span><br />
[12:29:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it is likely he will be rather drained when it ends, if it hasn't already.</span><br />
[12:29:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That escape into the airvent might have been an attempt to give him enough time to rest.</span><br />

[12:57:46] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: oh, my name is Emil, by the way</span><br />
[12:58:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats close to emile</span><br />
[12:58:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: can I call you chugga</span><br />
[12:58:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :P</span><br />
[12:58:18] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah, okay! Nice to meet you, Emil- Oh FL please.</span><br />
[12:58:24] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: pfft</span><br />
[12:59:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I currently have Oceania in a room with access to a food replicator.</span><br />
[12:59:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It seems like there are humans native to this universe that well, are complete asshats.</span><br />
[01:00:25] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh... well, people kinda are asshats at times- wait.</span><br />
[01:00:25] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I would assume that not all are asshats</span><br />
[01:00:35] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Food replicator.</span><br />
[01:00:35] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I would also assume that there is more than one group of humans</span><br />
[01:00:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah we can alchemize star trek stuff</span><br />
[01:01:00] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL you are letting a native human mess with a food replicator.</span><br />
[01:01:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Native Mobian, actually</span><br />
[01:01:22] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, here's the thing: DON'T.</span><br />
[01:01:41] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I must agree with EQ</span><br />
[01:01:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: turns out we subconsiously created a fuckton of races.</span><br />
[01:02:25] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL, do you think this universe might have a twilight cage? :P</span><br />
[01:02:42] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay I am not shocked if that is the case. But we agreed to let them all make their own tec, and not have them mess with ours.</span><br />
[01:03:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Seriously get that person away from the food replicator.</span><br />
[01:03:28] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: how did they even get here?</span><br />
[01:03:35] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I say we cloak this planet or something</span><br />
[01:03:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it just teleported all the way from another galaxy and it managed to find us, I don't think we should be too worried about that.</span><br />
[01:04:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh. Teleportation is one thing.</span><br />
[01:04:42] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Being able to create other useful stuff out of any matter around is a very different thing.</span><br />
[01:05:19] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Seriously um. Get them away from the replicator before someone or something is hurt or changed into a baked-food item.</span><br />
[01:05:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: time travel and teleportation is cake to this race</span><br />
[01:06:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think an integrated food replicator is going to be much of an issue</span><br />
[01:08:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL, once this starts falling apart because you let the race (who are advanced in some aspects and could easilly not be as advanced in others) near flipping /replicators,/ I will only be there to say "I told you so."</span><br />

[01:09:23] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL, you're being irrational</span><br />

[01:09:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not worried.</span><br />
[01:11:03] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: anything can affect it</span><br />

[01:11:15] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: any little thing could break the balance</span><br />
[01:11:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TIME. TRAVEL.</span><br />
[01:11:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah. That stuff, you have to be careful with. Preventing paradoxies and what-not. Good on them for being advanced enough to handle that.</span><br />
[01:11:27] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: although</span><br />
[01:11:34] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: now that he knows</span><br />
[01:11:48] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I'm not sure we can let him go back without erasing his memory</span><br />

[01:12:10] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: gotta go fast</span><br />
[01:12:14] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: However, time travel is not the end all everything is solved bam they are the most advanced they can possibly be- uh... depends on the game.</span><br />
[01:13:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sonic CD, Sonic 06, Shadow the Hedgehog...</span><br />
[01:13:19] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL, for all you know he could send word to someone on his planet and have them invade and take the damn thing</span><br />
[01:13:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think you all are worried too much.</span><br />
[01:13:58] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: .....I am moving away from τhis planeτ inτo one wiτhouτ τhis kind of crazy shiτ</span><br />
[01:14:01] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I don't</span><br />
[01:14:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah that is smart TT.</span><br />
[01:14:18] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: its too much of a variable to let happen</span><br />
[01:14:39] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: This is what happens when you basically make all of us live on one planet.</span><br />
[01:14:51] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I have no idea how earth managed it.</span><br />
[01:15:12] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Earth had 7 billion people buffering between us.</span><br />
[01:15:19] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: well on Earτh none of us had poτenτial τo creaτe and desτroy</span><br />

[01:16:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yes. 7 billion other people who were most likely crazy in their own right. -But I will give you the access to explosives and powers and replicators thing.</span><br />

[01:29:17] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I must agree with them though</span><br />
[01:29:38] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I suggest some sort of mind wipe and sending him/her back home</span><br />
[01:30:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if we mind wipe they will just send more</span><br />
[01:30:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all they managed to find the planet due to the massive energy use we have been using</span><br />
[01:31:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh, its quite a simple- wait we have been using a lot of energy? Huh.</span><br />
[01:32:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well a Furthest Ring server isn't cheap energy wise</span><br />
[01:32:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hmph. Fair enough.</span><br />
[01:32:44] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: could we find some way to cloak it from their view?</span><br />
[01:33:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would be too suspisious</span><br />
[01:33:12] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL, I feel as though you're just being sentamental </span><br />
[01:34:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -also, its fairly easy to just... well, not mind-wipe per say, But change the memories.</span><br />
[01:35:16] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: make iτ seem like τhey found absoluτely noτhing</span><br />
[01:35:31] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: seriously</span><br />
[01:35:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Seriously, manipulaton of the mind kinda is my forte. It'd be easy to say that this area has nothing, or just some sort of dead or dying star. Those are common.</span><br />
[01:35:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they thought we had a /chaos emerald/</span><br />
[01:36:01] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: then they're ignorant</span><br />
[01:36:59] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...please don'τ τell me we made τhe sonic universe</span><br />
[01:37:00] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: jusτ</span><br />
[01:37:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah um. I'm calling bullshit if a chaos emerald somehow gives off more energy than a blue dwarf star.</span><br />
[01:37:01] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: no</span><br />
[01:37:03] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: no.</span><br />

[01:37:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well one of the galaxys has mobians</span><br />
[01:38:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the universe is a big place</span><br />
[01:38:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, really fucking big</span><br />
[01:38:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think I could explain just how big it is</span><br />
[01:39:29] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i am done</span><br />
[01:40:02] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: so done</span><br />
[01:40:16] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: there is no such thing as this</span><br />
[01:40:23] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: TT, I agree completely</span><br />

[01:40:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Agreed.</span><br />
[01:40:34] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: this is incredibly silly</span><br />
[01:40:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right I'm just going to send him home</span><br />
[01:40:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and tell him not to come back</span><br />
[01:41:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ever.</span><br />
[01:41:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /ever/</span><br />
[01:42:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /EVER/</span><br />
[01:42:33] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah. I'd be easier if you'd allow me to change the guy's memories so he would think that nothing is here, but I somehow doubt you will let me do that.</span><br />
[01:42:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except they know we have quantum communication here</span><br />
[01:43:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No, they wouldnt. That's the thing. I can change that.</span><br />
[01:43:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously our source of internet is like a giant fucking blip on the radar</span><br />
[01:44:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its like SETI except /worse/</span><br />

[01:44:41] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL</span><br />
[01:44:44] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Mmmkay.</span><br />
[01:44:46] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: stop finding reasons not to send him back</span><br />
[01:44:53] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Where's the person I'm heading over.</span><br />
[01:44:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sending him back</span><br />
[01:45:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: to make sure they don't come back</span><br />
[01:45:12] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: not before the memory thing happens, I hope</span><br />
[01:45:14] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not without memories changed, you are not.</span><br />
[01:45:23] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: if you do that, they'll send more</span><br />
[01:45:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: KISS MY ASS HES GONE</span><br />
[01:45:28] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: they'll kill the fucking spiders</span><br />

[01:58:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I DID</span><br />

[02:00:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fine.</span><br />
[02:02:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll let you all handle explaining with false memories how a sun /came out of nowhere/, how this place is making internet, and how come people decide a blue dwarf isn't interesting</span><br />
[02:02:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: good luck</span><br />

[02:02:51] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: you let him get away</span><br />
[02:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GOOD LUCK</span><br />
[02:03:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all you can wipe the memories of an entire race, right?</span><br />

[02:04:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ASFDSKUGUGUHLRI</span><br />
[02:04:25] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: maybe the fact that YOU'RE the one who can't see the issue</span><br />
[02:04:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should just nuke the planet</span><br />

[02:06:51] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: and they'd attack and start a war</span><br />
