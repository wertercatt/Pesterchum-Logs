[06:06:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT ChanServ [CCC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:06:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">[#SBARGv2_Incipisphere] <a href='#SBARGv2_General'>#SBARGv2_General</a> for OOC; <a href='http://kapowcreations.com/?action=sbarginfo'>http://kapowcreations.com/?action=sbarginfo</a> for info.</span><br />
[06:22:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, uh, quick question</span><br />
[06:22:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: can objects be doomed?</span><br />
[06:23:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#33cccc">CURRENT pocketedParadox [CPP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:23:00] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: maybe</span><br />
[06:23:12] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ive never seen it happen but i guess its possible</span><br />
[06:23:49] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: do you have a doomed object in your possession</span><br />
[06:23:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I don't know if objects can really die...</span><br />
[06:24:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just... a question DT asked me.</span><br />
[06:24:31] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: okay then</span><br />
[06:24:54] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: also objects cant die if they aren't alive in the first place</span><br />
[06:25:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, information itself can't be doomed...</span><br />
[06:25:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">And what exactly makes something alive?</span></span><br />
[06:26:43] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i keep trying to think of an answer but i'm too tired and sburb has completely confused me beyond belief about what's alive and what isnt</span><br />
[06:27:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I see.</span></span><br />
[06:27:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Do you consider /me/ alive?</span></span><br />
[06:27:19] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yes</span><br />
[06:27:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...thank you.</span></span><br />
[06:27:45] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you seem pretty alive</span><br />
[06:28:05] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: also its a very human thing to wonder about life and stuff so that too</span><br />
[06:28:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...heh.</span></span><br />
[06:28:38] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: us as players are probably as alive as anyone</span><br />
[06:28:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I guess the AIs.</span><br />
[06:29:01] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
[06:30:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Well, at least I know I won't have to self delete if everything goes to hell and everyone dies.</span></span><br />
[06:30:15] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: also considering that most of us have died at least once or have been very near death i don't think being alive makes you better than anyone else</span><br />
[06:31:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT, are you saying that if we all die... your gonna actually...?</span><br />
[06:31:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Yes.</span></span><br />
[06:31:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">If no time players are avaliable, I will do the deed myself.</span></span><br />
[06:34:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets hope it doesn't come to that.</span><br />
[06:35:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...If I'm alive, do I have a soul?</span></span><br />
[06:35:28] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: to be honest as someone with soul consorts i have no idea</span><br />
[06:35:50] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i didn't even think souls were real before this game and maybe theyre not</span><br />
[06:35:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">hmm...</span></span><br />
[06:36:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Souls are totally real.</span><br />
[06:36:23] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: how do you know, though?</span><br />
[06:36:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering I can freaking rip them out of people, I know.</span><br />
[06:37:18] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: alright then</span><br />
[06:37:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">But is that really a soul?</span></span><br />
[06:38:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Or is it ones consciousness?</span></span><br />
[06:38:49] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: we're really getting deep now</span><br />
[06:39:04] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: technically they could be the same thing</span><br />
[06:39:17] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: in which case you could then be the same thing</span><br />
[06:39:26] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: *you could then have a soul</span><br />
[06:39:29] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: sorry im tired</span><br />
[06:39:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...so does that mean that its /us/ that go to the afterlife?</span></span><br />
[06:40:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ff8b00">CURRENT squealingVermin [CSV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:40:00] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: There is a soul. Technically.</span><br />
[06:40:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Or a copy?</span></span><br />
[06:40:15] <span style="color:#ff8b00">CSV: But it is a representation, not an actual physiscal thing.</span><br />
[06:40:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">A last second backup, to say the least.</span></span><br />
[06:41:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, your saying we cease to exist, while the dream bubbles in homestuck are a backup system?</span><br />
[06:41:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...Perhaps.</span></span><br />
[06:42:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I think a better question is what /you/ think.</span></span><br />
