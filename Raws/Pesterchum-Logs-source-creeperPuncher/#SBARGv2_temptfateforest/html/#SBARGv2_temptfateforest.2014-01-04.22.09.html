<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah this one works))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff790b">CURRENT caniblowuupBoom [CCB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  pretty much just walking along --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((temptfate forest, though))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  uncaptchas a flashlight --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is pretty much just trying to follow. Huh, this part of the forest doesnt look so familiar... but then again, not many people memorize parts of a forest. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  turns it on and keeps walking --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows, CB's scent trail working better than seeing in the nighttime forest --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  continues to try and follow. Flashlights would have been nice around now... oh well. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  reaches a small stream, it's not even really an inch deep, just more of a nuisance --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  attempts to hop over it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  sticks the landing! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  continues walking forwards --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  vague noises of the local nocturnal wildlife can be heard --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just walks through the stream, too sleepy to jump it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  continues following, just floating over the stream. The wildlife noises sure are nice... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  finally stops for a break at a clearing. none of the trees seem to look familiar, aspecially at this time of night --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  *especially --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  looks around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  turns a full circle, trying to find the way he came from --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: .......</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  catches up to CB --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  eventually reaches the clearing as well. Oh joy... well, looks like flight will be needed, to find a way out... She's lost as well! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh, hi.. you lost?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I wouldn't blame you, honestly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: im not lost, just.... taking a night walk! yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  is completely unconvincing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh-huh. In a deep dark forest, without telling anyone. Sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: riiiight...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, do you need help getting back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: sure whatever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: but do you know how boring that snoozefest town is? </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: there isn't even a skate park</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Tell me about it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: well, hopefully all that is open to change in a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, we were /supposed/ to go to space soon, but a certain Starfleet wannabe has been a no-show lately.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: We will find something out. Else, something is gonna explode from everyone being so dang sick of this planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Either or, something is gonna happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...let's hope something /doesn't/ explode, knowing FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Aaaaaaaaanyways, Kimura if you would please lead the way back..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, no prob.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts heading back the way they came --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: (FL is the reason why I'm betting something is gonna explode, to be quite honest)-Alrighty! Onwards!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: After you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  follows the group with a shrug, hands in his pockets --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  follows after CB, heading back. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: wait the flashlight</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  runs back over towards the clearing to grab the flashlight --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  grabs it and dashes back towards the group --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: C'mon. Let's go already. It'll only get darker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues following... man, what the heck has CB been doing lately, his scent is just... wat --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is just doing the floaty-follow-the-wolfy thing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  the group reaches the stream --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Hey. You gonna pull some "sick stunt" to hop over the stream, or do you need help?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: i can do this</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Afer you, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  gets a running start --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  jumps over the stream, attempting to do a 360 spin (key word: attempting) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  instead only gets to about 170 and lands roughly, catching himself before falling with his hands --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: im okay!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  pauses for a bit, before applauding. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Good job.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, not bad...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  gets back up, more scratches to the minor injury pile --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Anyways... onwards, once again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  continues following tCP --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  *CP --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  floats over the stream, and continues following --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  path-following intensifies --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  the edge of the forest is getting closer, whatever lights are lit in town can be seen --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, almost back. That was quite simple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  yaaaaaawns, and continues following. Bleh, its starting to get late... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, not too difficult.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: i bet you guys were scared werent you</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Naaaah. Not much to be fightened of around here... well, besides a bear or two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And for most of us... we are more of a threat to them, then they are to us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sighs at the bear comment --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: i heard you guys beat up all sorts of things</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: niki goes on and on about those stupid dungeon crawls</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, dungeon crawls were constantly a thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeaaaaaah... not lately, though. We kinda had to, back in the session. Stupid dungeons were filled with stupid creatures that, more often than not, wanted to kill people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: and the silent mafia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: i mean invisible mafia</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: same difference</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ..? The what-now? Invisible mafia..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Kimura, do you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: that cat guy lady</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. Gambit played a few pranks on him back in the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: the freaky one</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah. I see. Gambit, gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah, that sounds like something she would do.</span><br />
