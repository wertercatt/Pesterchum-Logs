<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I think I know what you're getting at... but seriously, wouldn't a zipboard work more easily?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean if push comes to shove I can abuse the wonder wings on my jet wings to protect me.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know. Its been four days.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How long does it normally last?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... well, under /normal/ circumstances, it works just like a regular "Magic Anon" thing, where the effect /and duration/ are specified at the same time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but you got a glitched version of the potion, so who knows... though I think there's an upper limit on duration?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'd say give it a week total, so if you're not human sized again by wednesday, we have a problem.</span><br />
