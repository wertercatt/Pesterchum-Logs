[12:06:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, and 6 are used for standard coords.</span><br />
[12:06:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />

[12:08:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a seven-number code for each address, with the last one always being... either 0 or 38, whichever one is point-of-origin. (0 makes more sense)</span><br />
[12:09:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so 3518743761 gates per galaxy maximum.</span><br />
[12:11:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, we would only be able to do 39 galaxies unless we use more than 8 for out of galaxy travel.</span><br />
[12:11:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we could do the 39 closest galaxys.</span><br />

[12:12:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also I assume you accounted for the fact that symbols can't repeat in an address?</span><br />
[12:13:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pfft, we don't need to do that if we use an XYZ coords system instead of the constalations.</span><br />
[12:13:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually you didn't. 38*37*36*35*34*33 is only 1987690320.</span><br />
