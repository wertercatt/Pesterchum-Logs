[03:06:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
[03:07:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I really think that post data I recovered was creepy</span><br />
[03:07:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but informative.</span><br />
[03:07:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but mostly creepy and makes me sad :&lt;</span><br />
[03:07:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: what post data</span><br />
[03:07:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://flmun.tumblr.com/post/62828989310/meanwhile-in-a-doomed-timeline-overseer-offshoot'>http://flmun.tumblr.com/post/62828989310/meanwhile-in-a-doomed-timeline-overseer-offshoot</a></span><br />
[03:07:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[03:09:08] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i wouldnt worry too much about alt timelines</span><br />
[03:09:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously</span><br />
[03:09:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The fact they got so far, and were... so /different/</span><br />
[03:09:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it makes we worry if we are a doomed timeline or something</span><br />
[03:09:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: me worry*</span><br />
[03:10:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i wouldnt worry about it</span><br />
[03:10:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like</span><br />
[03:10:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ash wasn't mentiioned at all in the post</span><br />
[03:11:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: we just have to try to do as much as we can in this one</span><br />
[03:11:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so?</span><br />
[03:11:28] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe ash just didnt contribute to whatever the post was about</span><br />
[03:11:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just wondering if she ever entered in that timeline</span><br />
[03:11:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly, I can't get answers</span><br />
[03:12:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: also i like how you mentioned ash but not the guy youre talking to</span><br />
[03:12:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: real smooth</span><br />
[03:12:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
[03:12:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just found it wierd, considering shes the one doing frogs in this timeline</span><br />
[03:12:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:12:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
[03:12:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: weird*</span><br />
[03:13:08] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: it looks like theyre talking about the skaian battlefield</span><br />
[03:13:19] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: which wouldnt necessarily involve ash</span><br />
[03:13:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either way, wat.</span><br />
[03:13:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there was a small bit about DS</span><br />
[03:13:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, doctorSpace</span><br />
[03:14:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so maybe he contributed to whatever this was</span><br />
[03:14:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: eh</span><br />
[03:14:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe she was there, but not a space player</span><br />
[03:14:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: if i was writing something about like the tomb of horrors crawl you wouldnt be mentioned</span><br />
[03:14:32] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but that doesnt mean you arent here</span><br />
[03:14:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know</span><br />
[03:14:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: youre thinking too hard about it</span><br />
[03:14:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But wouldn't you mention important people to you?</span><br />
[03:15:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like bringing up Amy in a small off topic rant?</span><br />
[03:15:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: dude, that timeline has completely different classpects and everything</span><br />
[03:15:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: we wouldnt make the same friends</span><br />
[03:15:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: or meet the same people</span><br />
[03:15:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...true.</span><br />
[03:15:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: necessarily</span><br />
[03:16:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean holy shit the coincidences that led to me meeting amy are incredible</span><br />
[03:16:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont think theres any branch before i did that would lead to me still meeting her</span><br />
[03:16:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sounded like the branch broke off before Chronos was revealed...</span><br />
[03:16:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, the gates seems to still be a thing in that timeline...</span><br />
[03:17:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that's kind of how it works, SL. a bunch of seemingly unrelated things add up to big events, and if even one is changed, the whole chain breaks.</span><br />
[03:17:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Butterfly effect?</span><br />
[03:17:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (heh. look at me getting philosophical about Time, and I'm not even that aspe-- yeah, butterfly effect.)</span><br />
[03:17:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: uh, brb</span><br />
[03:18:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: still raises the question of who Sophia was... eh.</span><br />
[03:18:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its a doomed timeline, the only thing we should keep from that is the codes</span><br />
[03:19:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe i adopted some other consort and named her that</span><br />
[03:19:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean i think the adoption thing was going to happen one way or another</span><br />
[03:19:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
[03:19:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but seriously i  have to go deal with stuff</span><br />
[03:19:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why would I fight sophia then?</span><br />
[03:19:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: GROUNDED CHILDREN</span><br />
[03:19:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: augh why does everything make no sense</span><br />
[03:19:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...amys a good kid and she almost doomed the timeline</span><br />
[03:20:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: a brattier child could have done worse</span><br />
[03:23:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: when is she ungrounded again?</span><br />
[03:23:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000ff">CURRENT blueBassist [CBB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:23:36] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hey, I think Homestuck updated...</span><br />
[03:24:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, it did</span><br />
[03:26:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: finished reading update</span><br />
[03:28:32] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Huh...</span><br />
[03:28:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: hey im back</span><br />
[03:28:48] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: shes grounded til this sunday</span><br />
[03:29:22] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: its less than she deserves, but this is the first time ive actually punished her</span><br />
[03:29:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: scolded, yes</span><br />
[03:29:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but punished, no</span><br />
[03:30:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so, yet more evidence against my parenting skills</span><br />
[03:31:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, you are a good parent. You care about Amy.</span><br />
[03:32:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't ever tell yourself otherwise.</span><br />
[03:32:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and most of the time i feel that way</span><br />
[03:32:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but sometimes i wonder</span><br />
[03:32:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yknow</span><br />
[03:32:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: if ive been doing things right</span><br />
[03:36:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the worst part is that im all alone in this</span><br />
[03:36:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: im the only parent here</span><br />
[03:36:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean ash had her siblings or nieces or whatever</span><br />
[03:37:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay.</span><br />
[03:37:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Talk to CC's mom.</span><br />
[03:37:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but its different when youre the only one responsible for the kid</span><br />
[03:37:22] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...good point</span><br />
[03:37:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact</span><br />
[03:37:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ive actually needed to talk to her anyway about amy's nightmares</span><br />
[03:37:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its getting around the time everyone needs to talk to her.</span><br />
[03:37:50] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: shes a psychologist and a parent</span><br />
[03:37:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cause we are all going insane</span><br />

[06:11:42] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: e_e</span><br />
[06:11:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the way he constructed that list shows that pretty clearly</span><br />
[06:11:48] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: you don't actually</span><br />
[06:11:55] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: know the definition of the word sociopath do you</span><br />
[06:11:56] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fl, here is the core question</span><br />
[06:12:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: do you think consorts are people?</span><br />
[06:12:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't think he does, Raz.</span><br />
[06:12:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Consorts are living, sapient beings.</span><br />
[06:12:28] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: do you realize that you have power over hundreds of living creatures with their own hopes and desires?</span><br />
[06:12:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and that you are abusing that power?</span><br />
[06:12:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Therefore they should be given the same rights as all other sapient beings.</span><br />
[06:12:55] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...FLm you are reaching Mike Nelsion, destroyer of worlds, here.</span><br />
[06:13:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: see its one thing to fuck things up by accident</span><br />
[06:13:24] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: its another thing to not do anything about it</span><br />
[06:13:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what was I supposed to say?</span><br />
[06:13:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: when you broke that track switcher, did you pitch in to help repair it?</span><br />
[06:13:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Sorry I murdered your family member, have a simpathy card"</span><br />
[06:14:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: or did you run off and leave those people to clean up your mess</span><br />
[06:14:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I had to stop a train manually.</span><br />
[06:14:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the answer to that one is "oh my god bones do not twist that way"</span><br />
[06:14:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fl, you could have gotten down on your knees and begged for forgiveness</span><br />
[06:15:14] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
[06:15:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and then you could have realized that you alone have the power to alchemize on your land</span><br />
[06:15:18] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: So.</span><br />
[06:15:21] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Imma just</span><br />
[06:15:22] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Ignore SL</span><br />
[06:15:31] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Because he's clearly intent on doing his own thing</span><br />
[06:15:40] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: And say something before I go to get a fucking drink.</span><br />
[06:15:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No, hes making good points</span><br />
[06:15:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you are a kind, fl</span><br />
[06:15:45] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: *king</span><br />
[06:15:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: continue, SL.</span><br />
[06:15:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
[06:15:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm no king.</span><br />
[06:16:01] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
[06:16:05] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: jesus h dick</span><br />
[06:16:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … wtf.</span><br />
[06:16:09] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Okay so like I was saying.</span><br />
[06:16:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you have the power of one</span><br />
[06:16:18] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Charles.</span><br />
[06:16:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just a spoiled tyrant who is a dick to consorts and can't even clean up his own messes.</span><br />
[06:16:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you could have gone to your consorts and told them that you made a very big mistake, one you can never make up for</span><br />
[06:16:29] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Fucking things up is one thing. Everyone makes mistakes</span><br />
[06:16:48] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: But you're not /learning/ from them. You're not /done/ making them and you don't show any signs of stopping.</span><br />
[06:16:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and you could acknowledge that you owed them a debt that cannot be repaid</span><br />
[06:17:00] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: The main reason being /you don't think about what you're about to do before you do it/</span><br />
[06:17:11] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: /thing about what the fuck you're doing before you act/</span><br />
[06:17:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See rob</span><br />
[06:17:26] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Just because you're a Heart hero doesn't mean you have to be a /moron/</span><br />
[06:17:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats what a mind player would say</span><br />
[06:17:32] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
[06:17:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: go back to that village, and tell them that you will give them anything they ask</span><br />
[06:17:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ...</span><br />
[06:17:42] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: look at</span><br />
[06:17:45] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: the last thing i just said</span><br />
[06:17:57] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: And when you /do/ fuck up?</span><br />
[06:18:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: get down on your knees and beg forgiveness, knowing that it cannot ever be granted</span><br />
[06:18:12] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: It'd help for you to try and make even a /middling/ effort to make it right?</span><br />
[06:18:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not a moron, I just have major issues acting under pressure</span><br />
[06:18:13] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Like</span><br />
[06:18:24] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Not just throwing your hands up as you've clearly done.</span><br />
[06:18:26] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: No you're a moron</span><br />
[06:18:30] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: Work on it.</span><br />
[06:18:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well then, theres no other pressing issue at the moment</span><br />
[06:18:42] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: On that lovely note I need a fucking drink.</span><br />
[06:18:47] <span style="color:#970025">CRS: And I hate alcohol.</span><br />
[06:18:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:18:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[06:18:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: why dont you take this time to go back and take  even the smallest fucking step towards making up for what youve done</span><br />
[06:19:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe if I drink enough I won't be able to feel them setting me on fire</span><br />
[06:19:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah that</span><br />
[06:19:19] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh, and another thing</span><br />
[06:19:30] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you say you dont want to go back because youre afraid of dying?</span><br />
[06:19:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll drink a ton and allow myself to be killed</span><br />
[06:19:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: im sure that consort was too</span><br />
[06:19:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:20:06] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />

[06:20:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Now /I/ need a drink.</span><br />
[06:20:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … brb hot chocolate.</span><br />
[06:20:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not even going to begin saying that the life of a player is more importaint, because its not, we are all equal here</span><br />
[06:21:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe I can just give up with the honey... let a consort take my place</span><br />
[06:21:23] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:21:24] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:21:25] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:21:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have taken too much from them already... even at the low price.</span><br />
[06:21:32] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: honestly?</span><br />
[06:21:37] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Some one.</span><br />
[06:21:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you arent a time or space player</span><br />
[06:21:45] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Please Smack some sense into him</span><br />
[06:21:48] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the session can be completed without you</span><br />
[06:22:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so you go over there and face the music</span><br />
[06:22:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#00aefe">CURRENT athensHeroine [CAH]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:22:10] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh joy, this is the conversation I enter the memo to...</span><br />
[06:22:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a better idea</span><br />
[06:22:30] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, hi Athena.</span><br />
[06:22:30] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh do you?</span><br />
[06:22:35] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: please, go on</span><br />
[06:23:00] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hello, and dare I ask what the current situation is?</span><br />
[06:23:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to drink now, then throw myself in when I'm so drunk I can't feel my pain receptors</span><br />
[06:23:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: no</span><br />
[06:23:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i will drive right the hell over there and toss you in myself</span><br />
[06:23:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL is being an angsty cowardly fucktard, SL is being a proselytising moral-preacher-type fucktard, and everyone needs a drink.</span><br />
[06:23:51] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Welp. Sounds like a normal day, then.</span><br />
[06:23:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, basically.</span><br />
[06:24:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah for all I know, I might be an angry drunk then murder an entire neighborhood of consorts, that would be /great/ for the PR</span><br />
[06:24:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How've you been?</span><br />
[06:24:08] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...I have too much  of a headach for this Shit.</span><br />
[06:24:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats not it</span><br />
[06:24:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you need to pay for what you did</span><br />
[06:24:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: every bit of it</span><br />
[06:24:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL.</span><br />
[06:24:32] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Myself? Busy, but fine. You, Gambit?</span><br />
[06:24:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i never thought id say this, but you deserve to be burned at the stake by an angry mob</span><br />
[06:24:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Who the /hell/ are you to dispense your version of justice? Judge /and/ jury?</span><br />
[06:25:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should throw myself into a vat of ACID &amp;&amp; Bacta</span><br />
[06:25:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, Athena, I was doing great until SL started talking. So, it's a normal day.</span><br />
[06:25:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh, do you think what he did is justifiable:?</span><br />
[06:25:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that would due wonders for the torture</span><br />
[06:25:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I think it's not actually your business, SL.</span><br />
[06:25:24] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: please, if the defense would like to make a statement, i am listening</span><br />
[06:25:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Wooo.... And FL what.</span><br />
[06:25:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: let me go fl's "im a heart player" route and point out that i am a life player</span><br />
[06:26:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tch. I'm no defense. If he'd shut the /hell/ up and quit being an angsty fucker who runs from everything, he wouldn't even be annoying.</span><br />
[06:26:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL, grow up. SL, stop preaching and playing judge-jury-executioner-too.</span><br />
[06:26:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and so when someone tells me they commited murder and then put a mockery of the victim in front of his friends and family, yeah, i get a little upset</span><br />
[06:27:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I can fix this... augh, but it would be cheating /so much/</span><br />
[06:27:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: do tell</span><br />
[06:27:32] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:27:36] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: SL.</span><br />
[06:27:43] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: It was a fucking mistake.</span><br />
[06:27:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Your upsetness doesn't give you the right to call him a sociopath-- which he /isn't/-- or start playing judge-jury. Yeah, he fucked up big time repeatedly and ran from it, but you're /not/ in fucking charge here.</span><br />
[06:27:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: that he refused to fix for /months/</span><br />
[06:27:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and he still isnt</span><br />
[06:28:09] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Get off ya bloody high horse. Before I beat you with it.</span><br />
[06:28:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And that's your problem /how/?</span><br />
[06:28:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Stop acting so holier-than-thou!</span><br />
[06:28:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Going into the code room and locating that poor consorts remaining scraps of code and try(99.9% chance this won't work) to put it together again.</span><br />
[06:28:23] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: And SL. He Thought he did FIX it!</span><br />
[06:28:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because that could have been my daughter, thats why its my problem</span><br />
[06:28:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … No.</span><br />
[06:28:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It "could have been" a /lot/ of things.</span><br />
[06:28:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It /isn't/.</span><br />
[06:29:16] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: AH. You are A denizen of Knowledge, yes?</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you are saying that we shouldnt care about someone commiting murder if we didnt know the victim</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And unless it /specifically is/ your problem, not "/could have been/" your problem, get off your judge's stand before I help FF beat you with the holier-than-thou stick up your arse.</span><br />
[06:29:42] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Mhm. Why do you ask?</span><br />
[06:30:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And no, SL, I'm saying that it's not up to you to order him around and force your ideas of what to do on him when you're not purrsonally involved.</span><br />
[06:31:22] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Because I Really Need a Damn Drink. Or somethign that would make SL and FL shut the hell up.</span><br />
[06:31:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, FF-- chloroform!</span><br />
[06:31:40] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ugh...</span><br />
[06:31:44] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a crazy idea. Not sure if this could work out, but what if I take you back to before you captchlogued the orginal consort, making sure you take the breandead one with you, and then you do the hearty thing to take the consort's soul so that you can give it into the braindead one? ➜</span><br />
[06:31:52] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: I think that Berserker Drug had some bad side effects. Head Ache Sucks.</span><br />
[06:32:00] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: And fuck you, Gambit.</span><br />
[06:32:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: actually yeah sj</span><br />
[06:32:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: try that</span><br />
[06:32:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: heeheehee.</span><br />
[06:32:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what if I just switch the braindead one with the real one?</span><br />
[06:32:21] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:32:23] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:32:24] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[06:32:30] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: FL.</span><br />
[06:32:31] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would cause an item circuit ➜</span><br />
[06:32:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No</span><br />
[06:32:37] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: Just... think, Okay?</span><br />
[06:32:39] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Um</span><br />
[06:32:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: also that still wouldnt fix the actual problem</span><br />
[06:32:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As the braindead one was created via an 8 digit code</span><br />
[06:33:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because you would /still be replacing someone with a lobotomized version of themselves/</span><br />
[06:33:03] <span style="color:#7e7e5e">CFF: And Also want to ask you about help for training, AH.</span><br />
[06:33:26] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, okay.</span><br />
[06:33:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if anything, it would be time travel simply generating information</span><br />
[06:33:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and Information can't be doomed</span><br />
[06:34:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so really, all I have to do is go back to before I captchaed the poor consort for the last time... and do a switch without me noticing.</span><br />
[06:34:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I don't even need to go back.</span><br />
[06:34:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT, you were a genius.</span><br />
[06:35:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll be right back.</span><br />
[06:35:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the ideal here is that there is no point in the timeline where a soulless puppet of a person is placed in front of that persons friends and family</span><br />
[06:35:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you're going to use the appearifyer? ➜</span><br />
[06:35:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need to make a stop at a meteor with a note to tell the consorts to be pissed at me... now.</span><br />
[06:35:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah Niki.</span><br />
[06:36:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
