<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Correct. Some of the session deleted players did not prototype fully.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Without Skaia as its old blue self, the most important parts of the session will pretty much be... out of luck."</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: We're okay.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Bakagami needed us to start the war again so he could get into the code rooms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its obvious in retrospect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ornis said that the code for the BAD EGG was missing.</span><br />
