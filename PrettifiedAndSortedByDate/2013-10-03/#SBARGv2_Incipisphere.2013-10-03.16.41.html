[04:51:53] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just gives me a headache</span><br />
[04:52:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because I need to get used to it</span><br />

[04:53:16] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: even without the risk of crashing thats just confusing and dumb</span><br />
[04:53:25] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: ...Why would you put a computer in tour brain anyway....Why would you put anything ..../in your brain/?</span><br />
[04:53:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its not a computer in my brain</span><br />
[04:53:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its more like shenanigans caused my brain to become a computer</span><br />

[04:54:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: even 4chan?</span><br />
[04:55:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cause personally I drank brainbleach after my brain viewed it right after going godtier</span><br />
[04:55:16] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: Idk :( that just sounds really scary and unecessary and...and dangerous...and...yeah</span><br />

[05:01:23] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: uhm....hm</span><br />
[05:01:57] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hearts are burgundy~</span><br />
[05:02:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a new theory when it comes to rogues</span><br />
[05:02:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rogues trade (with) aspect.</span><br />
[05:03:10] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: w-well....AG and the Commander...i asked them...about the whole title thing and....and what they think...i might be? th-they said...something about hearts and...minds...as...aspects? right? those are aspects and the other part's uhm....shit</span><br />
[05:03:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, they steal from people, and give to others</span><br />
[05:03:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sounds kinda like trading</span><br />
[05:03:45] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: like robin hood?</span><br />
[05:03:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where as, I trade souls?</span><br />
[05:04:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or even, trade my own soul for something else?</span><br />
[05:04:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In a weird form of equivelent exchange?</span><br />
[05:04:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ehhhh</span><br />
[05:04:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know</span><br />
[05:04:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would make sense with my power set</span><br />
[05:05:45] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: do uhm.....do you know a lot about other kinds of heart people?</span><br />

[05:06:17] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: like uh....pages? or....i think bards?</span><br />
[05:06:18] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: oh</span><br />
[05:06:19] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: ok</span><br />
[05:06:20] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: sorry</span><br />
[05:06:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, a bard invites destruction of/using aspect</span><br />
[05:06:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and a page masters (with) aspect</span><br />
[05:07:01] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: commander said he thinks...uhm...hold on lemme check</span><br />
[05:07:43] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: "page of heart" or....."seer of mind" maybe....AG said maybe bard of either...</span><br />
[05:07:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heirs and Pages are classes about growing up I think</span><br />
[05:07:55] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Possibly/probably.</span><br />
[05:07:58] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That sounds about right.</span><br />
[05:08:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While an heir becomes their aspect, a page masters it.</span><br />
[05:08:23] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: ...masters?</span><br />
[05:08:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but both focus on growing up.</span><br />
[05:08:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't know.</span><br />
[05:08:43] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: commander says the whole game is about growing up...</span><br />
[05:08:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: See it's real easy to quantify things simply like that but</span><br />
[05:08:58] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Development isn't a level to be achieved.</span><br />
[05:09:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's a slope made of up unique experiences, the likes of which probably fall only tangentially insofar as "one who blanks with blank"</span><br />
[05:09:48] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or whatever</span><br />

[05:10:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: one who chocolates with dinosaurs? ➜</span><br />
[05:10:11] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: all i know is....it sounds like people expect a lot of pages....seers are smart...and bards..hurt people.....even if they don't mean to...?</span><br />
[05:10:40] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i was a seer for a while, and i wasn't very smart at all!</span><br />
[05:10:48] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: in fact, i was pretty dumb.</span><br />
[05:10:57] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: or maybe that was specific to mind seers?</span><br />
[05:11:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well</span><br />
[05:11:06] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: it's really hard to follow this stuff....</span><br />

[05:11:31] <span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: but everyone seems to think it's really important...and..maybe i shouldn't ignore it....</span><br />
[05:11:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ah crap fuck.</span><br />

[05:13:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it was a lack of doing anything, such as conforting him, that made things worse</span><br />
[05:14:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but thats just my thoughts</span><br />
[05:15:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just feel like a moron right now</span><br />
