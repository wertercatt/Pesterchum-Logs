<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also wondering, can everyone understand Mewtwo, or only Ash/whoever it's currently talking to?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Um... good question, really. It sounds like Mewtwo doesnt wish to track via DNA-nes or whatever, so that means we just... have to narrow down the area of search. </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( For convinence, lets say everyone. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ah, so same way we've treated denizen talking then. works for me))</span><br />
