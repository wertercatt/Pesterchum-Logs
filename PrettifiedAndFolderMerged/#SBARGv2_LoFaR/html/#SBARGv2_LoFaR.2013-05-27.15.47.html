<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is coming in, asleep. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // and without an arm go figure. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  oh shi- hops up to the roof, clearing out an area and sending out the sprite to go catch him safely! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  /me crashes into the ground on the long fall boots, then falls over on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ack ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  crashes into the ground on the long fall boots, then falls over on the ground. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Damnit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  sighs and waves the deerscope over to go collect him, and then wanders back into the house. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is still bleeding from his arm socket. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  brings out his box as the sprite sets him onto a very clean metal table somewhere in the garage, and goes to work cauterizing the bleeding, salving, and bandaging the arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am not qualified for this at all but lol whatever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  presses on it to try and reduce the pain and stem the bleeding beneath the bandages --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  but hey the wound is burned closed, it's probably hurting differently --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  fucking waves over the sprite to use magic healing rays on the arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  just steps back and lets the sprite constantly spam healing majyyks onto the arm to stabilize it, going over to the workshop to work on a replacement --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  ...mixes together Bacta and that Bone stuff from HP and feeds it to him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  WHAT COULD GO WRONG --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  begins to grow a large growth out of his arm --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: HAH!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Can't believe that worked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Which is bubbling. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  pours some painkillers and coke and rubs his throat to make him swallow --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  swallows. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  mops up the blood and goes over around the house to go build and improve on things. Leaves 3 bottles of water, painkillers and instructions, and a laptop with pesterchum for FL. --</span><br />
