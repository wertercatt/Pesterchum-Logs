[07:05:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: We need to talk and I don't feel like dealing with the memo.</span><br />
[07:05:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: okay?</span><br />
[07:06:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Have the horrorterrors said why they're talking to you?</span><br />
[07:06:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: no</span><br />
[07:06:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I just had that one dream where one told me to bring all you guys out of the session and that they would take care of everything.</span><br />
[07:07:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: yeah. did "that one" have a name?</span><br />
[07:07:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I didn't ask.</span><br />
[07:07:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: He had a ton of really sharp teeth though.</span><br />
[07:08:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Yeeeaaah. Did he speak audibly?</span><br />
[07:08:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Like, you actually heard him talking/whispering?</span><br />
[07:08:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, kinda.</span><br />
[07:08:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I didn't really get much of what he started out with.</span><br />
[07:08:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Were there audible noises?</span><br />
[07:09:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But as it went through well...</span><br />
[07:09:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: His voice kinda sounded like a low growl.</span><br />
[07:09:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Okay.</span><br />
[07:09:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: That is /not/ a good sign.</span><br />
[07:10:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: There are two kinds of horrorterrors, FL.</span><br />
[07:10:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: The "good ones", like AD, who Ornis has confirmed to me that we can trust, and who are intent on guiding us and helping the Session, possibly for their own personal entertainment.</span><br />
[07:11:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: okay...</span><br />
[07:11:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: wait what is the second?</span><br />
[07:11:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Those "good ones" are the /Silent/ Court. AD has confirmed both that they only speak (truthfully) to Void Players-- SV hasn't been able to get anything from 'em, for example-- and that they /do not make audible noise/.</span><br />
[07:11:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: They are /completely silent/.</span><br />
[07:11:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Thus, you were not talking to a "good" horrorterror.</span><br />
[07:12:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...oh.</span><br />
[07:12:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: The second is the classless horrorterrors, or the stragglers. Those left behind when Chronos /brutally murdered/ the entire court that was /supposed/ to be guiding us, and left the Silent Court as the only nearby court to come watch us.</span><br />
[07:12:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: They're in it for their own benefit.</span><br />
[07:12:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: They're the low-class ones, the courtless.</span><br />
[07:13:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: They are /not/ to be trusted and will in fact fuck your shit up.</span><br />
[07:13:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: I've dealt with both the courtless and the Silent Court in the past.</span><br />
[07:13:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I think I get the idea.</span><br />
[07:14:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: I can tell you now that if you listen to the horrorterror in your dreams, your shit will be fucked up, and I'll have to come fetch your mutilated corpse from the void, even if your mind has already been ripped to shreds.</span><br />
[07:14:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: So don't do that, because I'm lazy.</span><br />
[07:14:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: got it</span><br />
[07:14:26] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Sweet. We're done here. Sayonara or w/e.</span><br />
[07:14:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So wear the muffs when sleeping.</span><br />
