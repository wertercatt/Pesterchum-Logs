[09:50:58] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and as some people know, I often feel left out of things. And usually the reasoning others have is that they either forgot or never thought to include.

[10:01:36] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I mean, I know they're sort of like "special moves" like limit breaks in final fantasy games :&gt;</span><br />
[10:01:48] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: but they tend to correspond to the aspect :&gt;</span><br />

[10:01:59] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and I'm not well versed in the aspects :&gt;</span><br />
[10:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the jump from 2 to 3 apsect frays might be... too much.</span><br />

[10:03:57] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: heart 1 might seem op in the sense of "can avoid any attack". Even though it doesn't say any attack. :&gt;</span><br />
[10:04:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its the equivelent of the Parry from Wind Waker.</span><br />
[10:04:49] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: ah :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:05] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I could probably let heart 1 slide, then :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also matrix shit</span><br />
[10:05:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Fraymotif effects aren't permanent, right? :&gt;</span><br />

[10:05:54] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Then heart 1 is okay :&gt;</span><br />
[10:05:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They wear off after a period of time.</span><br />
[10:06:02] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: it would only become op if it never wore off :&gt;</span><br />
[10:06:24] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just gotta be wary of how long the motif lasts for :&gt;</span><br />
[10:06:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh my god could you even /imagine/ that for heart 2?</span><br />

[10:16:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just realized with the price of FL's frays halving each purchase... you only need to save up /just/ under twice the orignal price to get it for everyone in the session.</span><br />
