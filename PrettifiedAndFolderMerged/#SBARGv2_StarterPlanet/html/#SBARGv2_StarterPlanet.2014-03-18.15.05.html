[03:06:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:06:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  exits the bar, heading forest-ward --</span><br />
[03:07:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // You see a foot twitching, sticking out of a large amount of sharp leaves. --</span><br />
[03:07:50] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  thinks about it, and equips the KSP spacesuit to be safe, then walks over --</span><br />
[03:08:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is pretty stuck in those vines. And the only tree stump he could have tripped on is 2 meters away. --</span><br />
[03:08:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // You see, this is why you don't /run/ in a forest. --</span><br />
[03:08:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, let's see what we got here...</span><br />
[03:09:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts powerslashing the vines to clear them --</span><br />
[03:09:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is revealed to show... a large amount of swelling. --</span><br />
[03:09:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oog...</span><br />
[03:10:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tries to say something, but can't move his mouth... at least he has a new pair of shades on. --</span><br />
[03:10:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts trying to pull FL out... ironically, by dragging him with a drawn vine --</span><br />
[03:11:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is successfully pulled out. --</span><br />
[03:12:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake's <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL'S]</span>  luck stat is equal to... "i" --</span><br />
[03:13:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[03:14:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, let's get you back to the bar... maybe Adal has something to cure the swelling...</span><br />
[03:14:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  flips FL onto his still-spacesuited back and starts walking back to the village --</span><br />
[03:16:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  arrives and heads inside ((==&gt; bar memo)) --</span><br />
[03:16:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CCP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
