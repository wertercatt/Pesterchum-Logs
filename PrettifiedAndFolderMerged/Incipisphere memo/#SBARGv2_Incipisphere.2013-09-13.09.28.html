<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: I can help!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though, DS still needs more help than my cat does. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then after we install antivirus on it, we are totally installing Java and Minecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All opposed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … not really, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: his piece of shit network got broken and what we have to do doesn't make sense. plus nothing's happening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all opposed to installing minecraft on LOBAT's network?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i do think finding the wi-fi vs finding the cate is a tricky dilemma</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … we can take a cat-finding break.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all who actually want to do my silly plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no one cares fl</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so noone would care if I took the time later to study the network and figure out how the operating system works so I can actually get Java and thus Minecraft running on a land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might be kinda cool, I guess. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you'd have to ask DS for permission, as he's the land owner...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: assuming its not just having programs running directly to the assembly</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: it's just the network there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: minceraft sucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: like the Internet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: something broke the Land Internet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so what part of the land are you two at again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: can I connect the network to beta earth later?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: we're in a fuckin' tower somewhere by a blood lake.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some tower ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah, hyper sonic sounds, music to my hears</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ears*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: i'm listening to the encrypted plea from ornis all that time ago</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://sbargv2.bandcamp.com/track/help-me'>http://sbargv2.bandcamp.com/track/help-me</a> that one</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: I think my ear drums are being contorted.</span><br />

<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: That faint buzzing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yes</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … KH, what's the problem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .../wow/. six months and one day into this session, and that is LITERALLY the first time I've heard that joke. *slowclaps*</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: No problem, I just think it's more polite if I wait for my Server player to be on before I start doing heroic shiz.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't get it</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Plus, someone needs to bear witness to me being incredibly clever, otherwise whats the point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nevermind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, kinda sounds like sleepy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: CP is popular internet slang. I suggest not googling it.</span><br />
