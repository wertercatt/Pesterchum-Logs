<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Make 'em alphabetical I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stick them on a rack and hope that you find the right one</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay. I'll group them by subject, alphabetise the titles in each subject, and alphabetise the subjects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that works</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Yeah, because we can't do authors real well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm not gonna lie I only barely care about this right now because I"m watching Summer Wars' finale.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Good stuff. Nope, /great/ stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I care about it because it involves books.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We don't need "area".</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: First thing we should probably do is set 'em up with some kinda database, log 'em all. Then maybe once we've got that info down we figure out how to organize from there and carry on</span><br />
