[04:42:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how does that look for moods on a new pesterchum theme?</span><br />

[04:57:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: composing myself an original fraymotif</span><br />
[04:57:32] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: for either me and fa or me and ag</span><br />
[04:57:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: aka the hatred fraymotif :p</span><br />
[04:57:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sweet.</span><br />
[05:07:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: it has a slow piano trying to play a soft melody, against a violin trying to play an energetic piece</span><br />
[05:08:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and then the two start - in terms someone who knows as little about music as i do would put it - fighting for domination of the piece</span><br />
[05:09:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: SOUNDS FUN.</span><br />
[05:09:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Sounds like Devil went down to Georgia.</span><br />
[05:09:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  @ _@ caps lock</span><br />
[05:10:06] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah the "fight" portion is kind of reminiscent of devil went down to georgia</span><br />

[05:10:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Violin is fun :3</span><br />
[05:13:24] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i even have the piano try to play ode to joy but getting interrupted by the violin doing some half-assed remix of it</span><br />
[05:14:30] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: if the mental image you get is fa playing the piano part and sl playing the violin part, with fa glaring and sl smirking, i've nailed it</span><br />
[05:14:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Can you play violin?</span><br />
[05:14:59] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i cant play anything irl</span><br />
[05:15:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: this is all sequenced</span><br />
[05:15:16] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but the instruments are representing the characters</span><br />
[05:16:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You suuuck.</span><br />
[05:16:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who wants to play guitar hero?</span><br />

[05:24:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 10, 9,  8,  7,  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</span><br />
[05:24:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the piano part gets fed up at one point and just starts banging on the keys</span><br />
[05:27:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: at which point the violin mockingly plays the same melody significantly more harmoniously</span><br />
[05:28:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I almost kindof want to actually play that now.</span><br />
[05:28:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 'Cause I'm a p good violinist.</span><br />
[05:28:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: musicfighting is fun.</span><br />
[05:28:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Make a second version that fliped.</span><br />
[05:28:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where the piano player wins instead.</span><br />
[05:29:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dude any good violinist would just play /behind the bridge/</span><br />
[05:29:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: fuckin' impawssible to replic8 on piano.</span><br />
[05:29:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: godawful sound.</span><br />
[05:30:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright im almost done then ill upload the midi and post it</span><br />
[05:30:16] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: before i start remastering</span><br />
[05:30:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is there a way to simulate the sound of a violin breaking?</span><br />
[05:30:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: samples probably</span><br />
[05:31:02] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: when the violin wins im thinking of inserting samples of a chair scooting across a floor, footsteps, and a door closing</span><br />
[05:32:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, why not have a third music tune that cuts in?</span><br />
[05:32:43] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright lemme save and upload the midi</span><br />
[05:32:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then common enemy?</span><br />
[05:32:49] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i want it to just be two</span><br />
[05:32:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />

[05:35:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i need to go get my laundry, let me know your thoughts</span><br />
[05:35:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: for when i get back</span><br />
[05:36:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what, no oncore?</span><br />
[05:36:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is shot. --</span><br />
[05:40:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah</span><br />
[05:40:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: basically</span><br />
[05:40:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CSJ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[05:40:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: that was supposed to be something you could see the characters playing</span><br />
[05:41:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fa is on piano, and she tries to do a simple melody and have sl follow along</span><br />
[05:41:03] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and he does for a while</span><br />
[05:41:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but then he says "fuck that" and just sort of does his own thing</span><br />
[05:41:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fa gets fed up and starts playing basic scales</span><br />
[05:41:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: sl deliberately does them wrong</span><br />
[05:42:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: she starts playing ode to joy, and sl continues to fuck around instead of actually acting as an accompaniment</span><br />
[05:42:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fa finally gives up and just starts banging the keyboard</span><br />
[05:42:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Do you even know how low a violin can go?</span><br />
[05:42:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just out of curiosity.</span><br />
[05:42:48] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: not really</span><br />
[05:42:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: understand i mostly work in synth</span><br />
[05:43:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i can almost play a piano and thats about it</span><br />
[05:43:19] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah and sl proceeds to follow the melody she accidentally creates to the note</span><br />
[05:43:23] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: presumably while staring right at fa</span><br />
[05:43:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: she grudgingly plays along</span><br />
[05:43:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and then the song ends</span><br />

[05:44:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: dude no</span><br />
[05:44:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't think violins /can go/ that low.</span><br />
[05:45:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i can shift the low violin bits up an octave or two if need be</span><br />
[05:45:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *nodnod*</span><br />
[05:45:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: or just change it to a trumpet or something</span><br />

[05:45:48] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: brb</span><br />

[05:47:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: +1 to doge</span><br />
[05:48:33] <span style="color:#eab800">CCG: Mainly just cause of the customization of your model now.</span><br />
[05:51:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: banjo might work</span><br />
[05:51:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: mainly since the violin part sounds vaguely like banjo strumming already</span><br />
[05:51:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: also sl is southern</span><br />
[05:52:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: eh, doesnt sound too good next to a piano though</span><br />

[06:20:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: SL, It works, I guess. Dunno, it seems like the usual sorta stuff of your current skill level, but it's kinda hard to pin down something to say about it. I would say to try and experiment with polyphony, but that would sorta go against the point of the song, seeing as the instruments are supposed to compete. Perhaps they need to have a purpose to try and convey besides noodlenoodlenoodle.</span><br />
