<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: mornin</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mornin'</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So, it's pretty early, and not many people are around but yeah there were some things I wanted to say about last night</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: How's everyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just something to keep in mind for later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry about last night.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mistakes were made on both sides. I know I fucked up some things and I'm sorry for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And sorry for resorting to something as transparent as an invisible wall but at the same time I just can't let some things fly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It could have just lead to a pointless pump system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The entire point of that grate was when the water level fell, it would let down a key that could be retrieved by reaching through</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it WOULD have been sequence breaking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But considering that you keys didn't break when used, it could have just... not worked on anything except the lock it was made for.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The key was for the room's exit, the hatch at the very top</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And you people had found that lock. Like the first thing. You'd've probably tried it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I know in a game as crazy as Sburb there are get-arounds of all sorts and crazy powers that might triviallize things in a typical dungeon crawl but is it too much to ask that you guys at least /try/ and do things the right way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You can trust that I wouldn't make some grate in the ceiling that you needed a magical bodice to get through, that there was a signifigance to it and a way to get its loot somewhere else in the area.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Someone suggested making it not a grate but in that case the reaching through and retrieving it wouldn't have worked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, try and think of it through the characters eyes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah I see where the disconnect comes in</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Their friend is likely dying, and they care more about saving him then doing puzzles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">discoNNect</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DAMMIT NN</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: nn. please.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: nn pls</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">gooby</span> pls</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Raz, I was able to follow the string of puzzles and descriptions easily enough, and ICly I was having a blast, but-- especially when the entrance was blocked off to force them to stay in this dungeon when IC and OOC they didn't want to be there anymore-- it seemed a lot like railroading. We /had/ to do things a certain way at a certain time. And we weren't allowed to say fuck it and head</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'll definitely work on that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even in the most railroaded of games, there is sometimes a reward for sequence breaking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And don't even get me started on the Prime Space Jump SB</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: At least let everyone /leave/. And running it as a typical dungeon-to-be-solved instead of a rescue mission would probably make people who were there to save the dude more likely to participate. The invisible walls. Didn't make that much sense. And kind of sucked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">ruNNing</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: â€¦ also, OOC, I'm sorry for the complete failure to communicate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its time to announce the annual annoy NN day. It is sunny out, and a nice time to look for pennies outside, and put mayonnaise on our Tuna fish sandwiches.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2c2cac">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Anyone think NN does it just to get a reaction?</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> is exactly the case AG.</span><br />
