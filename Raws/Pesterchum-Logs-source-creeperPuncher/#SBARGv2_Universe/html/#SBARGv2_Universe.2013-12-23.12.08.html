<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://feed-the-beast.com/'>http://feed-the-beast.com/</a> Okay, download the client first.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because separate launchers like that usually require the base client to be vanilla</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and OptiFine has to be directly installed in the jar itself</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it downloads multiple client folders, and you can edit the jars in the folders afterwards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, in your main FTB folder, you will get a folder for every modpack you download.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'll see if I can try to get the client to work here...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh shit I should've switched back to default textures first!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured out how to load Optifine without going to the jar directly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There should be a jar that has all of the Optifine data, right?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also shit, controls overlaps!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there is so many new blocks that your texture pack won't work anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, controls overlaps, wat do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, remap the controls once more?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, its fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't worry, as those controls only come into play when holding certain items.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might start out similar, but after you get redstone, thats when things start to majorly pick up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since redstone is the basis of energy basically.</span><br />
