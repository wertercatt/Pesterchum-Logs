<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey Puppy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hi there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I still haven't remembered my name yet... but since it seems like most of you call me that now, I suppose it works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: do you know how old you are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure, but definitely an adult wolf by this point...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: does time even work the same across worlds?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would say I'm almost 20 or so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: using earth time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which I can</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: see about calculating in multiversal time</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I did come from an Earth as well... assuming yours was the same type, then I was about three or four when I got these powers, and was protecting my land for a few years after that before ending up here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did your earth have days that lasted 24 hours, and years that lasted 365.25 days?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you're asking me to /count/ those? anyway, the days here seem to be about as long as they were there, so maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, sounds about the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It lasts about... six hundred quindecillion universal time units</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okaaaay then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: in universal time unites</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: units*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Planck time ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I was kind of figuring, with THAT MANY ZEROES...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, you do anything over the week?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not much. I think I was actually sleeping for most of it, because I remember the dragon guy... and then woke up in a room here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just spend it making magic items</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you try not to interact with other people during that time, I think the universe tends to let it happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huhwha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Blame the General Mechanics of the universe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is in the library reading. Which, for anyone who'd spent any time here with her, would be the first place anyone would think to look. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit's <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG'S]</span>  room is on the map. Probably. Either that, or she's added a footnote to the map that the library is her room now. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  blinks and looks up at him. "Hey, puppy! Haven't seen you around for a while." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, I was apparently asleep upstairs since we got back the other day...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That, and I haven't really been out of the library, except to ward my room...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  takes the elevator up and knocks on AG's door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alanna? You awake?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  No answer would be given. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So, how're you doing today?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  knocks some more. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doing okay... is this place usually this empty? the hotel I mean, not just the library.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have no idea. I was only here a few weeks before you, but even all the people I met in the few times I've actually seen people around… no idea where they are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The library's usually pretty quiet, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't know how many people hang out here on a regular basis, but I sure haven't run into anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Does FL accidently activate the warding traps or something? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  attempts to open the door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ..also, what do you mean, "ward your room"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  The door is securely locked. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, you know, the usual. Set up all sorts of different magical traps. Some easily detectable, some hidden in those detectable ones...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks away, taking the elevator back down. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't think any of them activate unless you manage to get the door open, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks into the library to check up on Puppy. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, because I think someone went in there to look for you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Oh jeez.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: My door's locked at the moment. Hope he didn't try breaking in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks around the corner --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why would I try breaking in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dunno. You might have a deathwish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Do you have deadly spike traps on the other end of your door.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Of course not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just keep everything on me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  reaches into his bag and unfolds a table. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, I keep everything I value in a transdimensional storage pocket. It's more the principle of the thing and assuring I won't be ambushed in my sleep, y'know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Very nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  puts the table away, folding it back up. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not that those could help you if someone weaponized a sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nope. But if I'm up against that strong a mage, I don't really stand a chance anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  sighs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If I'm not one-shotted, I can dimension hop and hope I haven't been tracked again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what do you mean again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeaaah, it's, uh. Occasionally harder to get away from mages than you'd think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean, I'm only wanted in like, seven dimensions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nah, I faked my own death. By… dying. So I think I lost that trail.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: please tell me one of those isn't Sigil</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Never heard of it. What's it like there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait, you died and came back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its this giant inverted ring... its a dimentional nexus point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its a giant city...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ankh of Resurrection and someone there owed me a favour. And… more description?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ohhh, the one with dimension doors?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its ruled by the lady of pain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Oh/ shit yeah I've actually heard of that one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I knew a guy from there, learned some shit from him. Hopped dimensions a couple timespans later. Never been there myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been there... five times?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oooh. Is it very nice?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They still value salt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As much as silver.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, magic works the same way...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe salt isn't supposed to be easy to get?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Riiight… we do have an ocean around here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Bit to the north</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You and me need to make a trip there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Get us some salt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out an amulet with a white gemstone on it... that is solid white, not transparent at all. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  holds it, and a massive salt block appears infront of FL. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: whoa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tucks it away. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  sighs. "In that case, can I just get directions?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This little thing stores a few /thousand tons/ of salt in a pocket dimension.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have about 400 tons left...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should go over for a visit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Hey, Edward. How do you dimension hop?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how do you even... /why/ do you even need that much? O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Really complex magical spell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Elaborate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I basically... shift between universes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't really land anywhere specific though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How, I mean, can you describe the spell process?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I haven't shifted into deepspace /yet/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls a long, metal rod out of his bag of holding. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This is what I use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stares at the thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I were to activate it, several smaller metal rods would come out of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They would each arrange in a different position...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think there are about... 10?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I never really counted... Pretty sure its around 10 though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: some of them go into positions that kinda break my brain...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I try not to focus on them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  puts it away. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the book that contained the information about it mentioned something about strings and dimentional membranes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So you've got a device you use?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, really, thats what helps me focus the spell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And what exactly is this spell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its called "Plane Shift"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How does /it/ work exactly? Runes, diagrams, somatic or verbal components… does it have a specific "flow" it taps into?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it requires me to focus on the spell alot... moving my hands around and yelling out the name of the spell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the focus I showed you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly all I do is slam the pole into the ground, while focusing and yelling "plane shift"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What does it feel like to use it? Would it work for anyone who focussed on those two words?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How did you learn it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I read a complex book... I no longer have that book.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I don't think so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hm… okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if you wanna try and get the lady herself to give you the book... well, I'm not gonna really be able to help you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Which Lady?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Lady of Pain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was my second visit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ah. How'd you get it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Picked it off of a dude that was laying in a smoking crater.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and who had several rocks sticking through his corpse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Works for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, the book said that if the focus got destroyed while casting the spell, well, I would be torn apart through multiple dimentions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I didn't see the focus on him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I assume something was attacking him and he tried to escape.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you use a different focus for every spell you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, some spells don't really need a focus... I've been working on transfering all my spells into magical artifacts...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's your favourite spell? And how have you acquired them all? Are you able to act as a teacher for any?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know /every spell/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know how you got that idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I don't have that idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How have you acquired all of the spells you have acquired?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, most of it was either painstaking research, it just "coming to me", or learning it from a book.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would have to say that my favorite would have to be Polymorph.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stops zoning out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's that one do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you have any of your spellbooks or scrolls with you? And… that sounds like a very interesting spell.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's the custom. High five!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True Strike?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's that do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It basically makes shots /impossible/ to miss pretty much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, you still miss 1 time out of 20, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh. Huh. What's the mechanics behind it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It basically aims at where the target is going to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ohhh, it's one of those.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've got an equivalent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And ocasionally, the shot goes around trees or other stuff in the way.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm really bad with future sight or predestined strike sort of things.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: A caller's magic? You can teach me that?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You can't summon anything thats stronger than you though, as that... is rather dangerous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Write down as much information as you can, then, please!</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, of course. That's how it works with even bond-creatures or talismans. Does it have to be specifically a quill and parchment, or?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, just parchment or paper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have something that might make this faster.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  the quill finishes, and lays itself down next to the sheet. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Are you controlling it directly using your mind or does it only know the words you want written?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, it copies anything I read.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  and then promptly loses interest in what's happened to him in favour of pulling out a large metal tub from out of nowhere and going to dunk it in the ocean, filling it up, then labouriously dragging it back up out of the water to more of the beach proper.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly pulls the incredibly long blade of grass out of his leg. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at least it's outside this time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah...</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  has another tub and as such has run off to fill that one with water and drag it up onto the beach near the first while her summoned elemental makes salt for her. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  helps funnel water into the tub by pulling out two linked holes, and dipping one hole in the water while holding the other above the tub. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  The tub is slowly filling with salt as the water is constantly added and evaporated by a red mage and fire elemental working together to generate massive amounts of heat. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  not to mention keeping the fire elemental around! --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  maintains her link with her summoned fire being to keep it evaporating the saltwater, trying to stoke the flames she's holding even hotter on her side. Whee more salt! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  puts the amulet around Puppy's neck on "collect" mode, submerging the second portable hole. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  okay then :P --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls the hole out, noticing the amulet isn't absorbing anymore salt. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  has severely overestimated how much of her channelling capacity it takes to keep a fire elemental in this plane and under her command and collapses onto the sand the moment after she scratches out part of a rune to desummon the thing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  spits out the portable hole --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a mirror. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sleepy now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  grabs onto Puppy and Alanna. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is dumped onto the lobby floor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  falls on the floor behind them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  flops over onto the lobby floor, almost completely drained. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is pretty much just flopped on him. He's kindof the only thing keeping her upright right now. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks over to the door. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just cast a spell on the door to open it. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  opens the door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  A spiderweb of alternating golden and white runes would have come to life on the door the moment magic was cast on it, starting in a faint glimmer but building up to a nearly fiery intensity as a wave of energy washes over the party-- a painful knockback spell. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is shot against the wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  It also would have /hurt/. Kindof a lot. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alanna.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /would you kindly open the door and rest/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is still slumped against him. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is against the wall, in pain --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ow. again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: before I /end/ you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is rather pissed off. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You do remember me telling you about the traps earlier, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...vaguely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I specifically mentioned them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah shut up</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  pulls herself away from him, nearly falling over in the process. "Idiot." And then making her way into her own room and firmly closing the door behind her. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, I guess I am.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at Kimura, then down the hallway. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You should rest too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I... guess we'll talk later about what you discovered then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...actually, we can talk now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, sure. so what is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, if you are /here/, that may mean that your world is missing a god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On a scale of 1 to 10 on the holy shit quota, this reachs a seven.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh. I see your point. though to be honest, I didn't even think about that when I met the other wolf...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I hope everything's okay at home...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: considering a ten is complete destruction of all reality in all of its forms, seven is still quite bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There /was/ something that managed to make it to a nine... something about a "chaos heart".</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that was taken care of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh shit, I thought it was a Sonic ref and then I realized Super Paper Mario O_O))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...How attached are you to your powers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean, like, can I transfer them to someone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I were to bring Ammy back from the dead, would you be willing to give the powers back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, it would involve using my last wish diamond... but it would be for the greater good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably... she's likely a lot better at it than me anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what /is/ a wish diamond, anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...A wish diamond is a small diamond with the power to grant one incredibly powerful wish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, bringing someone back from the dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, /they are incredibly rare/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its not like I can constantly make them... I can't even /make/ wish diamonds, I got my three as a boon from a god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, in that case, hold on to it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there might be another way that doesn't quite THAT much effort.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I used my other two on stupid ass stuff, I might as well use the third on something with value.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay... if you're sure about that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we will need to make it back to your plane first.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that's the other issue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That is why I needed the blood sample, to identify your home plane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It didn't take much to extract the surface contact of this plane from the sample...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out the device, looking at a sheet of paper with eleven numbers on it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It will take a bit to set up the Pole of Plane Shift, as well as getting a way back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. it was a random fluke even getting here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think something must've ran into me in the middle of using Mist Warp</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, another day then? it /is/ getting late, after all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and when we do RP that eventually, I'm playing Ammy for obvious reasons and because I gots a plan.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  wobbles torwards his room... and falls over... It seems the knockback reopened FL's grass wound. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you gonna be okay there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, let me just... actually get this patched up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, night. and thanks for helping find out about me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads to the room he woke up in earlier, figuring it's "his" room now --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  assumed control of a room by trapping it within an inch of everyone else's life. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok question: how cheap would it be to have Ammy revived with her powers already restored and let Puppy keep his own?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( very ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((or even more ridiculously, have something go wrong during the power transfer, and she /copies/ the abilities (including the Permanent Tongues spell) instead of taking them?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((anyway, guess that's it for tonight's hotel session?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I guess so. I'll upload the log to the hotel blog))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( probably so. new developments: the pyro can summon fire elementals, we have salt, and CP is the lost god of another dimension ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((or rather, was given powers by them))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((either way works :P))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((thank you.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( DUDE ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( WE SHOULD SET YOU UP AS A GOD ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( That'd be fuckin' /ace/! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( you have a god's powers ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( and there's a vacancy :DDD ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((but wouldn't that involve staying there as a full-time job and effectively staying away from the hotel due to responsabilities?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( … we could visit. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that's kind of why I was thinking of shenanigans to restore Ammy to that position and let Puppy stay at the hotel...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((especially because of the whole "it was a fluke getting here to begin with" bit))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( true… :\\\ ))</span><br />
