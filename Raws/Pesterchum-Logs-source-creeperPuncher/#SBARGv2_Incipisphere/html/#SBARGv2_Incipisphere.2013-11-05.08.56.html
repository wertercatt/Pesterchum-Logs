<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: that's why he died heroically cause he totally sacrified himself</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fat fucking chance</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: MV, the problem is, it was a POINTLESS Heroic Death!</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: { sacrificed* i am all over the keyboard today }</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: but it was still heroic</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we already had the boss at half health when he did the fucking Chaos Dunk!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm willing to bet the last thought that went through his head is "Oh shit I'm going to die".</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He does this sort of shit /all the time/, CP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He's always about the martyrdumb! Even when it's useless and would probably hurt if not kill /us/!</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: honestly i think that his beta version is going to be a serial killer in maybe 5-10 years</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe more of an arsonist</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((sl is kind of a self-insert but i think he can be analyzed separately from me because hes a semi-exaggerated version of me))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, considering he "perma"died in /my/ land's final dungeon, I feel at least indirectly responsible. and I say we're reviving him. I promised Crux that I would.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i dont think anyone can perfectly self-insert))</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: what if he gets revived and gets pissed and nukes us :c?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((CP started as a self-insert, but became his own separate thing when he self-protoed. we still have mostly the same personality, but different enough to not count as a SI anymore.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why the heck would he do that? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he thinks of nukes like normal people think of punching</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: probably not going to do it right after being revived</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i don't want anybody dead but everybody keeps complainin he's so nuke-happy</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, what I meant was, the clock can't land on BOTH Heroic /and/ Just, is what I was saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how do you prove that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but it can favor one</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The clock's probably not physical, it's a metaphysical representation more then an actual object</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Scratch probably just had one since he's </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: special</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Which Spades Slick destroyed somehow</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'd say</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Ornis had one, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ornis is special too</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that you should just not make assumptions about shit we don't know all about</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I've been reading recaps, slowly but surely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: First Guardians that are able to have a conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we don't know enough about the clocks</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or guardians as is to really make any definite statements that could be "derived from logic"</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there's a lack of source material</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anywho.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Clocks can be manipulated?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah. the clock will either, not choose one cause you've not made sufficient actions that led to your death to cause one to be chosen</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they can be</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Areanea did</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: as far as we can see, Light players can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: And so can Slick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: with a crowbar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i would go as far as to say, due to Void being a sort of weird thing like them too, could in addition</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Knocking the clock over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Slick made physical contact with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a special juu jbreaker crowbar ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: So, it could likely have physical manipulation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *jujubreaker ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i wouldn't say him hitting it is what caused it to choose just</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Like, what if someone say, grabbed the grandfather clock?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i 'unno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: then they becokme the person the clock is about</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: obviousl</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Forced it to make a certain choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I doubt that, kitty. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: then the clock turns into nic cage</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think the manipulation is... well. less than physical.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but at the same time, i can't say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: and the related player becomes auctually imortal</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...Who would have to gain from FL's death?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: CN would</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i really don't know what happened with FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i understand why DD stayed dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and that is all i understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing less.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Apparently died heroically after a suicidal attack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: even though CP mentioned that suicide /can't/ be heroic or just.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: what was FL doing it for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: suicide is meant</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: within the context of "bluh bluh, gonna kill myself."</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Because if he was sacrificing himself to save some inocent, then its heroic</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: to defeat a boss that probably could have been defeated in a safer way ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what SJ said</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: do trust me w<span style="color:#730e8f">hen I say that</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /if/ it meant preserving players who are necessary for later events.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: and apparently that does /not/ include FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if we were all about to die, Perfect Magnus charging a Laser of Kill Everything, and FL used Chaos Dunk... yeah, THAT I would completely understand being Heroic!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but the boss was already at less than half health, and all of us were still fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...I guess this leads back to the consorts...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Does anyone still remember that list?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's like saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: "everything was going fine until FL killed the boss,"</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not saying it makes complete sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I know it had one of every aspect and class...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who knows what could have changed in those last moments.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "until he /overkilled/ the boss in a kamikaze attack". FTFY.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kay</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (is okay, took me a while to find that one out too)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: all i can say is. we don't know what /could/ have happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Plus, those consorts were using weaponry made by ProtoTech, which the company apparently went under recently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: unless one of you were a Seer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: After the /CEO vanished/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...should I count the electrons on the atom symbol?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you want to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either the atomic number/name is a clue, or you waste a few minutes counting. either way, better to do it than not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: 61...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: on the periodic table, it points to Promethium ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Which is named after Prometheus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Promethius... wasn't that his denizen, and the former CEO of said company?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who is this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or CC</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...So, wait, you said "wasn't"</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uhg</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: fuk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm talking about Prometheus!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Promethius got killed a while ago. FL tiered right after the fight, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Anyone know what that fight was about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was supposed to be like, some sorta business meeting regarding the heart of the land ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Wasn't that dying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I mean, it would make sense that might be causing the quakes, but I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, and FL was trying to get it back and put it back where it belonged. He succeeded, but at the cost of hundreds of consort's jobs. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: massive unemployment ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: DJ, LoSaCrossroads is dying /now/ because FL permadied. the land was dying earlier from the heart being gone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: FL had been going on about the fight being "too easy".</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that makes sense, considering how few hits it took. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: What did the heart look like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, Kim, do you remember? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It was shiny.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yo</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but according to Replay Value, all land hearts are big glowy orb things.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Mine didn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SE, no. DJ's land was Dead for months.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...How big are we talking, Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, and I look after a deadland cluster. Plus that one you took us to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Like, small flame, or miniature sun?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That one didn't totally explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: miniature sun</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It wasn't very sunlike, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It was like a flame. In a jar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: /oh fucks/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Doesn't FL like, set his soul on fire for fraymotif use?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, burning requiem ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think that's like, his favorite move or something ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...so um, would you say a soul /is/ like a tiny flame?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: depends on who it belongs to, but probably yeah ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm sorta thinking that it might not be FL's lands heart at the center of his land right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ????? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ProtoTech weapons, the consort said something about the lands heart promising land...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you saying that the denizen's heart instead? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Yes, /exactly/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Prometheus made his death easy so he could take over the land with his soul.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ._.; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that figures.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, we need to find the real heart of the land? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We don't need to do anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's a dead and dying Land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Which means Prometheus wants FL's body for some reason.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Holy shit. This gets dumber the more I hear about it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ..................</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Holy shit so we just go set everything on fire until it stops being a body</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: easy</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Unless he has more than just one backup plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Raz, can you fuck up a Land's heart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How so, exactly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I dunno, but if the Denizen's heart got somehow shoved into the Land, if you could fuck it up that'd be one less thing to worry about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh yeah I could probably get rid of that</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah that'd be cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: There still lies the matter of /getting/ to it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, that's a thing ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: anyway yeah how hard can it be</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm betting there is a large barrier of plotineum.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: plotineum? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plotshitium you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait a minute, wasn't there like, a hole blown to get there a while back? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the crater DT made?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: what crater?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that one place that's pretty much a nice park or whatever now ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: LoSaCrossroads has a pretty big crater near the south pole. it's actually a pretty decent picnic spot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Oh... I don't see a hole there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I think it might have gotten patched up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: time player waving like a noodle in the background ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it got grassed over when he restored the land's heart... or /thought/ he did, anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: so there's nothing we can do about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: But the fact of the matter, is if we are to destroy it, we need to get someone who can't exactly phase through walls down there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay. So we /go down there/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Well, the consorts are bringing the bodies /somewhere/, right?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: yeah, and what happens if your void powers give out while under a kilometer of solid rock?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: We aren't going to be losing /another/ player, thats for sure!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … they don't have a tendency to do that, now that I've tiered, and anti-Aspect fields theoretically exist but I also tend to have a split second to back away before I phase in if intangible... but I haven't actually heard any better solutions from you, so.</span><br />
