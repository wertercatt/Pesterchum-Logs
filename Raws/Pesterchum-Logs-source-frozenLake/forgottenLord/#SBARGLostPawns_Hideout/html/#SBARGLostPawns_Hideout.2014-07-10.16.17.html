[18:27:39] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( -- CURRENT forgottenLord [CFL] is stuck in some snow. Again. Looks like hes gonna have to wait for everyone to catch up. -- ))</span><br />
[18:27:40] <span style="color:#ff5500">CPP: ...D'I need to be all 'floaty' n'stuff to get there? 'Cause I'm the least floating person here and I probably should have thought of this before tracking AS down."</span><br />

[18:28:17] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: well, there is a chain that leads there, though I'd personally suggest getting a flying thing to get there.</span><br />
[18:29:45] <span style="color:#ff5500">CPP: OH. Neat. Okay. Just, rough figure, about how long is this chain...?</span><br />
[18:30:32] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: I can't remember?</span><br />
[18:31:34] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: um... I think like..... kinda long but not super duper long?</span><br />
[18:32:01] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: kinda hard to tell.</span><br />
[18:32:24] <span style="color:#ff5500">CPP: I'll be fine~. You guys go ahead, I shouldn't be long. I'm a picture of athleticism!</span><br />

[18:33:48] <span style="color:#ff5500">CPP: Or I could hitch a ride. That'll also work. If it, er- won't slow you down.</span><br />
[18:34:34] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: eh, usually doesn't. the laws of aerodynamics are kinda glossed over with GT flight :P</span><br />
