[15:10:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[15:10:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...overseer thing?</span><br />
[15:10:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah its a reference to overseer</span><br />
[15:11:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also is it just skype taking forever to update or has noone said a word since 6:39 AM my time?</span><br />
[15:11:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: looks about right ➜</span><br />
[15:12:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope, the last message in that memo /is/ you at 4:40am PDT.</span><br />
[15:12:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay one minute off then</span><br />
[15:13:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, skype message times are shown relative to the local system clock so</span><br />
[15:13:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay here is an... interesting question.</span><br />
[15:13:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also this: <a href='http://babbyoverseer.tumblr.com/post/80662772239/would-it-be-possible-to-add-to-the-how-many-weapons-in'>http://babbyoverseer.tumblr.com/post/80662772239/would-it-be-possible-to-add-to-the-how-many-weapons-in</a></span><br />
[15:14:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What would win in a fight? Lord English, or the Gurren Lagann?</span><br />
[15:16:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...well, I don't know much about the latter because I haven't watched the series, but from what I've heard, it'd probably boil down to home turf advantage.</span><br />
[15:16:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sure, lets give LE the advantage with the green sun and all</span><br />
[15:17:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I mean /either/ side could win depending on where the battle took place.</span><br />
[15:18:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you see, thats /also/ giving the gurren lagann the advantage.</span><br />
[15:18:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; Convert <span style="color:#00ff00">Green Sun</span> into Spiral Power</span><br />
[15:18:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; ???</span><br />
[15:18:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; Profit</span><br />
[15:19:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........fair enough.</span><br />
[15:19:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in which case, it boils down to "if it takes place in a Dream Bubble, LE just has to destroy the environment and he wins; otherwise Lagann wins with the <span style="color:#00ed4f">Green Sun</span> power".</span><br />
[15:20:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would only work if the GL was a constuct of the bubble.</span><br />
[15:20:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It only /hurt/ the horror terrors on the outside of the bubble.</span><br />
[15:21:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even if it wasn't, the bubble being destroyed would destroy ANY non-LE entity within the bubble.</span><br />
[15:21:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are we sure of that?</span><br />
[15:21:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and come on, they're fucking /horrorterrors/, of course they'd only be injured by REALITY ITSELF CRACKING.</span><br />
[15:21:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because the only entities inside of the bubble other than LE were the ghosts</span><br />
[15:22:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Equius was brought back.</span><br />
[15:22:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (my reasoning is that if the bubble popping didn't nonexisticate Lagann, bubble-entity or not, the /cracks/ would.)</span><br />
[15:23:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...True enough.</span><br />
[15:23:33] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">DID</span> SOMEONE SAY</span><br />
[15:23:34] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">NONEXISTENCE</span></span><br />

[15:24:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we give LE the wand, we need to give the Lagann the Arc Gurren and the FALSE MOON.</span><br />
[15:25:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: btw FL, is the Overseer chain closed even though the overview page doesn't indicate it? I'm just wondering.</span><br />
[15:25:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It /is/ closed.</span><br />
[15:26:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, I figured it was because <a href='http://www.theoverseerproject.com/sessioninfo.php?session=SBARGv2AU'>http://www.theoverseerproject.com/sessioninfo.php?session=SBARGv2AU</a> doesn't show any gaps, but overview.php doesn't have any indication that destitutePilot ==&gt; enderquestral.</span><br />
[15:27:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (also, you would be able to edit in additional players into the chain later right? that's still a thing a Session Admin can do?)</span><br />
[15:27:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (because of the whole "Rob said he was going to recreate his account and set his land to have a grist class containing Blood" thing)</span><br />
[15:33:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I can do that</span><br />
[15:35:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: k. wasn't sure how nerfed Admins had been made, after you said you couldn't change a land's grist class...</span><br />
[15:35:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't do functions the resetter lists.</span><br />
[15:35:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ......../oh/.</span><br />
[15:37:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, based on babbyoverseer's response, it looks like I either need to &lt;zalgo&gt;G E T   C R E A T I V E&lt;/zalgo&gt; with some more ninjaKind submissions to fill the massive power gaps, or look for a second specibus card to expand into another abstractus...</span><br />
[15:37:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which involves dungeon diving for the second thing.</span><br />
[15:38:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dual wielding helps though.</span><br />
[15:39:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... but of the few ninjaKind weapons on that gdoc, the only decently-powerful ones are two-handed which means no dual-wielding weapons.</span><br />
[15:41:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: now what drops the specibus cards again? dungeon imps with only 1% probability?</span><br />
[15:43:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[15:44:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, at least my weapon power is enough to get /in/ the front door, I guess I just gotta get lucky with encountering an imp and even more lucky on the loot.</span><br />
[15:44:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: try this</span><br />
