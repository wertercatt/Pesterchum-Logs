<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT flightlessIcarus [CFI]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty sure we don't have a cheese factory around here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: hay FI</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: be fore Kat whent missing did any of you notice anything unusual?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Aside from the fact that she was getting increasingly hostile in general towards everyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, the katstle shenanigans for one. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I would try it, but not sure if it would work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it might have a chance of killing her or me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or both</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: try what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, what are you planning? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Also are we in any danger from Azure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, if anyone would be in danger from Azure, it would be me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Hm... wish I had one of Gambit's cards. Would make finding her a non-issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: mαybe she just wαnts to be left the fuck αlone</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I was kinda thinking of using Kat as a flare target... but that carries the risk of telefrag.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But If I stayed in soul state...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, I doubt I'll try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Doesn't sound a very trustworthy method, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, so its agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not doing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: And Seth, the last couple of times we "left her the fuck alone," things only got worse for basically everyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: whαt did she do then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: I believe one time she threatened to blow up her planet and everyone on it (which was about 10-15 people or so) if they didn't leave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: wtf</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: I may be remembering incorrectly. I wasn't actually present, I was just sent the logs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yes... that incident... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the bacafe ban</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: er, <span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafé</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I have an idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we need a breath player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Along with DS's sensors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: why a breath player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kat's barrier prevented all objects from passing through, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Uh-huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: oh i see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So what we do is induce planetary rainfall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: but air still has to get through</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: just enough to find the barrier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: If we cant get a breath player I have schimatics for weather control satalites</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure that's even a remotely good idea for the environment? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: not flod levels Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like seriously, it'll at least mess up the weather patterns. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even if it is just a sprinkle ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: it rains in the desert Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: just less oftan</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what part of "don't screw with the weather or it screws with you" is so hard to understand? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: What would you propose the Breath Player do though, Charles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: make it rain and then look for a dry cercal</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why did I read that as "dry cerial" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: your not the onlyu one</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hey guys</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: hay SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, can you use your maidly powers to search for false life?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (aka life aspect animated dolls)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: specifically life-affiliated stuff should be pretty easy to find... gimme a sec</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pretty sure there is a way to do this for every aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((TT, can i detect any dolls))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((no.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...nothing out of sorts that i can detect</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Niki, could you hop to the future and give us her location?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Ok Im in the Republics sensor lab</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Assuming the information was gotten via timetravel in the future?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (wanna keep the timeloop stable.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, last time I tryed to do a timey thing anywhere near her, it backfired ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: no taking the tymy wimy way out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EQ, could you buff the alien dudes psychic abilitys so he can try to find where she is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: I dont think that would go well</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Woah Okay I was distracted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Can someone fill me in on what is being requested and why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay alien dude says no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (glad he can read the memo through my eyes)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay. Yeah. Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So Life, Time, and Mind are ruled out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and we don't want to do Breath or Heart...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, not my way of doing heart at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: space or void might could tell where the castle went</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, a change in the location after all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Light would /know/ outright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since Luck and Knowledge is their forte.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: possibly</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: So we wate for Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about a Blood player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hunt her down by the BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hope and Rage um... not so sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Doom player would be able to see if anything is about to go wrong in a doomed timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Mm... I think maybe Rob could find her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: But seeing as how he's not online...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, he is better at the Heart gig.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: doom could just discover how fate is going to go</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hannah, if you were Kat, where would you hide a castle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: the north?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we could go to space</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, the sad thing is: I'm not kat so I wouldnt know. Maybe some place in solitude, like on a mountian yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I know where she would be if we can't find her with the weather</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a satelite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm thinking Kat might be underground or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If possible, I would have a castle underground or maybe in the air. But that's just me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: underground? i dunno...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not sure if thats really kat's place</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, could you like... talk to the plants and see if they know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeaaaaaah...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay I'll turn myself into a soul and try to use my connections to her to go directly to her. Except that could telefrag her or worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i cant talk to plants</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: they dont have brains</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: talk to the birds or something</span><br />

<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm not going to stand in your way, because that would be pointless, but if I find out you've locked her in that fucking machine, I'm getting her out. And if I find out you've killed her, I'm locking you in the fucking thing.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: join you in preventing further deaths of her I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm glad you're partly seeing sense, but you don't need to kill her at all. What she did was in the past, and Ben happened to tick her off at the right moment. It would be like, three months from now, me sending one of Ben's close friends the video of his death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just don't want cody dto die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Cody won't die. The most likely one to kill it would be me, and I don't plan to.</span><br />

<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Honestly she wouldn't, and essentially /doesn't/, give a fuck about Cody. So there's nothing to worry about, really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Especially when what you want involves one of my best fucking friends being killed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: And yeah, she has way better things to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fine</span><br />

<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: ...and kill people in the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#baba00">CAE: And then she'd kill you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: But would it make you the better person by doing that, Charles?</span><br />

<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Nah, she doesn't, but that also isn't to say she directly was involved in her death. Depends on how you look at it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Fuck, now I'm in the middle of a civil war.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This never would have happened if Gambit could have just keep her mouth shut</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Also... the only reason why she sent him those videos was because he didn't believe she didn't have the guts to perma-kill him ever. Which she totally does.</span><br />
