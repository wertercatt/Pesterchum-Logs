<span style="color:#660066">CDC:  <a href='http://theglen.livejournal.com/16735.html'>http://theglen.livejournal.com/16735.html</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The list can be found here. Enjoy!</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Thank you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: No, courageousScribe, more like "things that the rules technically allow but are completely and utterly fucking ridiculous".</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Lol </span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Any reason why failing to complete our session wouldn't result in simply a doomed timeline?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: For example.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: oh alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: "Not allowed to stabilize the dying villain before we make our escape just in case he was a load-bearing boss."</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Technically since our goal is to lose, aren't all out timelines "doomed" by other session standards?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think thats actually why the horrorterrors are helping us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: What's the particular reason why it would, LP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To change the rules slightly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: HEll, there's an entire segment of the Mr Welch list that starts "Even if the rules allow it..."</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The first one being "24. Even if the rules allow it, I am not allowed to summon 50,000 Blue Whales."</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: For example: "Even if the rules allow it, not allowed to carry 100 kilograms of styrofoam without an encumbrance penalty."</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: DC - because, I mean, wouldn't that be too much of a paradox for paradox-space?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: "Even if the rules allow it, I can't summon an army of squirrels to abuse the grapple rules."</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: Or something like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: Oh, here's a good one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Skaia's precognitive ability may result in the session knowing what will happen all along</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Synchronized panicking. Why am I laughing so hard at this</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: In which case, if we are predestined to succeed, it's a null session anyway so it was never going to be won in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: "If I'm commissioned to build an artillery gun, that does NOT mean a gun that fires howitzers."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say we just scratch chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: So, um, where does that leave us, in terms of agency?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that way, he becomes undone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Has Chronos' original session been destroyed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Like, all of it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I have a lot of questions - tell me to shut up if they get in the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Been-destroyed is a curious idea, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: I think in the end that will happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: I feel like I should know what you mean by agency, so why don't I? =/</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Oh, so it hasn't happened yet??</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: By agency I mean the ability to cause events to happen. It kinda implies "free will" but doesn't necessarily demand it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: what a strach? no</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Oh, sort of like if you try to cause a paradox in the past?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I think an interesting thing to take note of is that Chronos proves that Chronos is possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I read about this in Physics of the Impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Well, Skaia has always been like that. Null sessions exist because it knows the session will not succeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: But that's the only fact that is predicted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Hm. </span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: We can say that "Chronos proves that Chronos happened" but that's implying there's nothing we can do; but saying "Chronos proves Chronos is possible" opens up a single, distinct course of action.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: It doesn't stop shenanigans like, say, packing up all the session planets and the battlefield and shipping them off to another session. :p</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Why can't we beat him at his own game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The undoing option appears to be the favoured one, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say we go gurren lagann on his ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Ha ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: DC, do we know anything about the frequency with which that sort of Jade-tactic is done?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Assuming he has one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: FFFFF YES HE'S PROBABLY IN CAHOOTS WITH THE ANTI-SPIRAL TOO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: We need some drills STAT</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cc88cc">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: poof</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: LP: No, but we know it proves that a "failed" session isn't necessarily a wasted one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Hello, SJ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Hey SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: hi guys</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: hello SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: I just got done decorating the front yeard with halloween stuff!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: *yard</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Man...I kinda wish we could see what would happen IF we did different things other than listen to HT</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Nice. I went pumpkin picking today. </span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: AS: If we can get some alchemization gear in here, I might be able to provide some drills.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I have a core drill necklace already. :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: HT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: I mean, technically they're called "Vibro Blades", "Thermic Lances", and "Heavy Thermic Lances", but if it looks like a drill and acts like a drill...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: LP: I believe he means the Horrorterrors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: TA: ahhh, I see. Thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Core Drill necklace, sonic screwdriver, and isocahedron.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: A thought occurs. What does the Battlefield look like with so many players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Probably the same as usual?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Is it a finite space?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Huge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: (I suspect I'm forgetting some simple piece of information here, but this seems like the best way to reclaim it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: incomprehenbsible</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I always assumed it was more or less boundless</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Probably like a rainbow, with so many people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its problebly some sort of klein bottle now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Kaleidoscope, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: FL: That, precisely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: I like rainbows. Kinda sad my land wasn't a rainbow </span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: "Land of Rainbows and Rainbows"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I doubt It follows standard geometry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: DC, you laugh. But god damnit I'd want it. *u*</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Skaiaiaian topology seems like it has a lot of interesting potential.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Rainbow and glitter or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKAIA!</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: oh god what</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: aiaiaiaiaaiaian</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: (I don't even know. It seemed like the thing to say)</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Not meant as god no, but more like "lol oh my god"</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Sorry about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Nah, I wasn't suggesting you suggested it was bad. Merely bizarre.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Which, objectively, it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Seriously, though, is there any reason one of us couldn't kill all of us, escape our game, and go back to the game before us, tracing Chronos' footsteps but beating him to the punch by doing it a full session earlier?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually I say we go the simple route.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: That being?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We time it just right so we crash into him with a certain delorian...</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: LP: Well, there's the distinct possibility that whoever won the resulting battle royale would be just as insane, and we'd end up with Chronos mk. II</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Hey guys</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I just suggested telefragging.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: if I drew Chronos would that collect grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Depends on how you drew him!</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Ending up with an infinite loop of people becoming the next Chronos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: More or less.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Do we know why that isn't the case already?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Kind of like with Umineko, how people keeping becoming the new Beatrice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Do we even know that it isn't?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The current Chronos mightn't be the first iteration.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I suppose we could easily be the second state in what ultimately is an infinite series, but that *feels* unlikely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: That's a good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We could be the final state in a finite series, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Unlikely, but possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Or the non-final state if we fail, of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: SO much depends upon a red horroterror</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *cough*crashintohimwithatimemachine*cough*</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Or a police box, what about a police box?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: (( Given that I received Page of Space first, then randomized out of pure curiosity and received Maid of Time, I am perhaps at risk of becoming a perpetuator :p ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It needs to spawn in instantly though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: else he would know what is happening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I wonder if the TARDIS can travel through universes though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: In terms of a direct assault, I just can't imagine his existence having a single assailable state.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: That is true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: LL, I believe it can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So he's like an electron?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Like, the sum of all possible states</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: That's an interesting way of looking at it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: that collapse into a viewable state when observed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00557f">CTA: See: "Inferno", "Army of Ghosts", and "Doomsday" amongst others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: That seems to be the most rational way we have of looking at him</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Possibly, but if that were the case, somehow eliminating the viewable state would have no effect on the others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Yeah! Quantum superposition.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Exactly!</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Quantum physics, I think it's a part of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I know this because I looked up Schrodinger's Cat for fun once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how do we know he won't simply stop the scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Really neat thought experiement.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: *experiment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: There's a lot of probability that I feel uncomfortable with trying to assess,</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We construct a whole lot of spacetime teams, each consisting of one space player, one time player, and a number of others</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Because he could be anywhere at any time, he seems like a more dangerous version of Big Brother for some reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: but can we imagine that all techniques of attack other than ending-the-session-before-he-can-begin have been tried and failed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Each team sweeps the spatial and temporal areas around the Scratch event</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Chronos is watching, possibly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: he will likely try to. i imagen that we have to divert his attention between to things</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: :c</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: I was just...bothered by a doc scratch</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: stupid ass white text</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We potentially have a Seer who can observe the result of failed scratch attempts</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: And thus determine what needs to be done to succeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Wonderful!</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: I don't think he is part of the game at hand</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We could potentially feign a scratch with a sufficient number of players and abilities</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: No, but uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: the white text guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Oh, the Doc?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: (transport the actual Mesa equivalent, replace with an almost-identical copy in the same spatial location)</span><br />
<span style="color:#227d6c">CCS: I can't speak for the other void players, but I'm trying to keep as many people hidden from him as possible. Chrono, I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: DC: oh oh oh oh oh!</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Oh was just my idiot friend.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: If we determine that as a failure, we could then construct multiple false Mesas shell game style</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Oh my yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: WHAT OH MY GOSH S-CLASS TRICKERY</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Some temporal movement would be necessary to prevent him simply traveling in time to determine the correct one</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: But the logistics of that</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: are plannable!</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Using the time players to keep him frozen, perhaps?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The plan would have a single point of vulnerability: the moment at which we abscond with the correct mesa</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Sort of like what aradia did to jack for an amount of time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: That point would be where we focus our defenses</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: OR</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Jack did not have access to time travel, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Chronos might be able to free himself by sending another copy to stop the spell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Yeah. So Chronos could counter it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: I hope so</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: this is going too smoothly</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: That point could be where we focus our smuggler's paradise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#227d6c">CCS: It's unnerving.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: so we have to close him in first time and space</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why don't we just destroy all of time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Because we can't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The Final Sanction?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Refuting time is a full-time job.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: (see also: A New Refutation of Time)</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: becuase we would die too</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Aren't Time and Space one thing, Spacetime?</span><br />
<span style="color:#227d6c">CCS: Remember kiddies, dying is bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Yes and no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d8d213">CCS: what if we attempted a fourth demensional rotation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: But as god tiers, aren't we unable to permadie?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Or would we be constanly dying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Only heroic or just deaths.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">FTA2</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">FTA1</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: *constantly</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Ah. So since all of this is in the name of stopping Chronos....</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, we blow up the tardis. Then launch the pandorica with chronos inside into the sun</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: we'd all be pretty much boned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#227d6c">CCS: Wouldn't this all be considering heroic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The problem we have is that Chronos can be present at any point, temporally and spatially, that he desires. If he hits the wrong mesa, he can probably just act as though he did not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#227d6c">CCS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Yes. Lock him in the pandorica.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: But dying and ceasing to move forward in time are different things - and if you refute time entirely, you don't even get to die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Gosh, this is all so exciting and frustrating at the same time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: I believe the time issue is resolved in the same way that god-tiers cease to exist if their session is scratched</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: DC: Is the ultimate question, then, "do we have enough players to build enough mesas"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why not just captcharoid it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I know I'm not thinking big enough but I guess I'm trying to be practical about ending the world properly</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Unfortunately, no such number exists. Due to temporal shenanigans, Chronos can theoretically attack an infinite number of them. He has, quite literally, all the time in the world.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So how many plans do we have here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc88cc">CSJ: depends on what we'll make them out of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: We have this one, I think we can call it "False Mesa" or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Almost any plan will require that advantage to be stripped from him in some fashion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: and then we mentioned something else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: False Mesa Shell Game Partytown</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: or FMSGP</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only way to stop him is to stop all timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Yes. This will be a team name, if we all decide to collaborate again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So to stop time would make him vulnerable to attack?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But not much</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Is there something we can do in between "stopping time" and "not doing anything to time"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He still would have space powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Not necessarily all. Forcing him to participate in a sufficient number of stable time loops at certain points might tie him up enough to get something done?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Since he could still teleport??</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Wouldn't he be able to recognize that it's a loop though???</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Exactly, enough stable time loops OR stable space loops could give us an opportunity</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: At some point he'd realize that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Ah, okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: He would, but he would either have to be complicit in it or cause a paradox</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Either one would keep him bogged down long enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: There is also the issue of whether his resources are finite or infinite</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: He is, after all, still bound by his own narrative causality, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Trying to make sure I'm still following along in all of this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we need to time it so we all make the mesa AT THE SAME TIME.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: In that events that happen to him presumably form some sort of sequence?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: If they are finite in some way (only so much time travel) we could potentially wear him out with enough temporal combats or mesas or whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to do everything simaltaniously.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So we'll get like 40,000 mesas or so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I have no idea if the number updated to anything higher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Timing it so everything happens at once isn't too tricky. We have time people :p</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We send multiple spacetime teams with shrunk mesa duplicates and enlarge at the proper time</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Right. Splitting up into 12 aspects, at least 1/12 of these 40,000 people are Time players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Remember, of course, that the real mesa should be somewhere else entirely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why not have the timeplayers divide exponentionally. We would have doomed ones, so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: So if we assume that both HIS and OUR resources are both finite but nigh-inexhaustible, we have two major points of vulnerability -</span><br />

<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: In the strictest sense, we do have a limited number of time players (I think)</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: True, but we can create the timeline branches whenever we like</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: And counting the time players from doomed timelines,</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: that makes our number of time players countably infinite??</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Right. I'd propose that with enough finesse, our time players could branch sufficient timelines so that each player would have his own countable-infinity number of mesas</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I'm still triyng to get the handle on all this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: But the time players themselves are still limited, I feel</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only way to possibly beat him is to prevent time travel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The time players themselves are probably limited, yes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#660066">CDC: FL: I'm not convinced of that. Time travel gives him countably infinite potential</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DDoS the Medium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Which can theoretically be overwhelmed with uncountably infinite numbers.</span><br />

<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So we have False Mesa Shell Game Partytown (Plan A)</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: In fact if we can produce countably infinite doomed timelines, I THINK we only need a finite number of mesas per timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: No, never mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Medium DDoS (plan B)</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We need to be able to map our mesas one-to-one with an uncountably infinite set somehow</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm... what if we timeport several mesas into eachother?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: I don't see why the finite timeline restriction applies. We can go back as far as we line and branch off more timelines at leisure.</span><br />

<span style="color:#660066">CDC: like*</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: The reason I'm thinking finite timelines is because we still need players to man them, even if only with-respect-to player mortality</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to realize.</span><br />

<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Alright. Now uncountably infinite sets are "defined", not created.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plan B still is a little reasonable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We need as many plans as possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: DC: Or, saving, that, could we assume the process of monster attack holds some amount of statistical static? (or nvm)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: By DDoSing the medium to the point of preventing timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Right. We can expand on each plan later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We could always attempt multiple plans at once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: What about telelportation? </span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I expect we'll have to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Would limiting space leave us frozen in place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Somehow locking out time travel after the mesa dump may work to our advantage</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Teleportation requires an "away", right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So we can only limit time travel here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Teleport the mesa directly into skaia?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The mesa would still need to be scratched</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no travel time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: And that process still takes time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Teleporting it in is definitely an improvement, though,.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Ah. Silly comma.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So would you scratch it at the same time as the DDoS-ing took place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Or possibly before the DDoS-ing, but before the scratch itself took effect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we need to prevent Chronos from timetraveling... and stop him from being able to stop us from scratching.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The time travel lockout is definitely ideal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Just to make sure, the intention of the MDDoS is to stagnate or shut down all time travel?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we have to believe that the Scratch won't fail if we MDDoS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Whether it is even possible or not is another question. The first step of that plan would be to determine whether it can be done</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I have some ideas on that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to send doomed time clones back to the exact moment one of us goes forward.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, the build up of energy.</span><br />

<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: OR maybe not!</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: (It would bar time travel around certain points in time, which would prevent us from heading in there)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We time the lockout to be at all the moments chronos would travel in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: What if he just travels in at all the moments?</span><br />

<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Also helps explain a distinct boundary between "planning this" and "it happening"</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We could effectively temporally isolate an entire chunk of spacetime within which to mess around?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Yeah, I think so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We could probably spatially isolate it too, that would be easier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: However!</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: At this point, the vulnerability becomes the Mesa's transportation to Skaia</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: And if my napkin-drawn logistics are right, the time players could be almost entirely left out of this part of the plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Mind you, teleportation was suggested for that earlier</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Hmm. How? Aren't they necessary to facilitate the blackout's temporal nature?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Only right before it happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: well, or right after</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would need everyone to help.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lords could be the leaders, but I'm not too sure.</span><br />

<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: What about Space??</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lords have the raw power of the aspect.</span><br />

<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: So we've got Time Space and Void players</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Otherwise Chronos could theoretically perform a temporal cloning dump at some non-blacked out point</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Space, Time, Void, and Hope are the key heroes from my point of view</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Then advance "the slow way" through the temporal barricade</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: How so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The other players would focus on combining their powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Other players would likely combat Chronos variations that somehow slipped through</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Right. I've just realized something about using my aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Breath to blow away, Blood to explode heads...</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: And/or keep him distracted at various critical points</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Rage could be used as like a stat boost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You get the idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Stepping back for a moment, is there a third plan to consider?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Being angry triggers adrenaline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Making a universe without chronos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Well, assuming the MDDoS is distinct from the void barriers, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: FL: I believe that's our final goal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: As do I.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Meaning it can't really be part of a plan to achieve itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Void could intrigrate into mddos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Keep chronos from using his powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Plan "One of us becomes Chronos mk.0" seems really suspect to me, and is probably outside of our consideration</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: From coming in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Plan "Give everyone legendary weapons for an epic last stand" also has a few key flaws.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: LP: My main problem with that plan is that the person who comes out on top is likely to be one of the ones with the least qualms about killing</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: The last stand plan has some merit</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Using the mesa theory, we could match each possible Chronos copy with an entire player team</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: And then attempt to take him down at every point simultaneously.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that could lead to MDDoS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: However, the plan needs to be used in conjunction with another</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Because it fails if even a single team loses to Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Although it has the advantage that if each team opens with a time-lock</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: There are no other copies of Chronos to travel in and free the locked ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if we timelock the timelocks</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: So, what if we set up a void-lock AFTER Chronos time/space splits?</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: I'm not sure if there's really an "after" here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Like, mesa plan, and as soon as each Chronos is spotted, mass void-lock</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNH</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: My timework is probably hazy, sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: He could just retroactively change the external timing, I suspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: We're assuming that if we do anything, Chronos versions that observed us doing it can report to the rest of him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I'd say hypothetically but not definitively.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Breath players should focus on putting the mesa in the "eye of the storm"</span><br />
<span style="color:#660066">CDC: What if we lock an initial assault force IN with us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: DC: can you expand on that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Light players should focus on everyone being as lucky as possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time, Space and Void are obvious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time and Void are DDoS, and Space is teleporting the mesa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I think I recall earlier I was talking about how when you're really angry you initiate the fight or flight response</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Adrenaline production, full physical strength.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: Breath, Rage, and Blood could definitely take on both the monster-attacks and the chronos-es themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Maybe Rage and Heart work like Stat boosts</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: and Mind and Light players work logistics and communication?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Light oversees both fortune and communications, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mind would focus on preventing mistakes, Life would bring us back. But now we have Heart, Hope, and doom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heart could ally the monsters with us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c468a">CAS: Heart as a stat boost?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I'd be inclined to push Hope in with the Time and Void players</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hope and doom, I'm not so sure about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I expect a few more roles for players will come up as we see more of what we're facing</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: Yeah. I wonder if Sbarg can't get back in yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: I can't wait to see if we managed to reach the grist required!</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: I would like to see just one more really off-the-wall idea </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll go for now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seeya.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b082ff">CLL: See you!</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CLP: see you!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Post the log when your done, guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It may be our only hope.</span><br />
