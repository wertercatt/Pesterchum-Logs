[03:21:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CSL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[03:21:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: changed its appearance</span><br />
[03:21:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: again</span><br />

[03:21:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on the main part of the site.</span><br />
[03:21:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: with your subs and such</span><br />
[03:22:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, I never go to that part :P</span><br />
[03:22:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the "what to watch" section</span><br />
[03:23:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: firefox autocomplete does the job for me, I just type "y" and it automatically gives me "youtube.com/user/someGuy/videos" for all the channels I regularly watch.</span><br />
[03:23:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh</span><br />
[03:23:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />

[03:46:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so uh...</span><br />
[03:46:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: could you do a recap of that one dungeon?</span><br />
[03:47:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean Ash's virtual dungeon, or...?</span><br />
[03:49:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[03:49:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
[03:49:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... there was only one more room after you decided to quit, and... I think its effect was the inability to lie. so... the only thing you missed was "What Happens In The Matrix, Stays In The Matrix" awkward conversation.</span><br />
[03:50:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's pretty much it.</span><br />
[03:50:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...right</span><br />
[03:50:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...did you guys take care of Ash?</span><br />
[03:51:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, she was fine.</span><br />
[03:51:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SL did enough Lifey Thing to get her back on her feet, and we went from there.</span><br />
[03:51:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: physical damage doesn't persist when exiting the virtual world anyway...</span><br />
[03:52:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
[03:52:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How is she doing... mentally?</span><br />
[03:54:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: exhausted like the rest of us when we devirtualized, but fine otherwise. she didn't seem troubled by what Flipped You did, at least...</span><br />
[03:55:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: considering /I'm/ troubled by what flipped me did, that is suspicious.</span><br />

[03:55:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I might not be remembering right, though...</span><br />
[03:56:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh, also, I managed to make a thing so I don't /need/ to use the Oina Method to change form. because "loss of brush powers == mode lock" isn't something I want to have to do again &gt;_&gt;</span><br />

[05:26:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well... Victini /was/ in Unova, which is new york city... aka america.</span><br />

[05:29:21] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: sup</span><br />
[05:29:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, in Kanto, there is mentionings of a war that had just ended...</span><br />
[05:30:09] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: eh?</span><br />
[05:30:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (with Lt. Surge and all)</span><br />
[05:30:52] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: what did I miss?</span><br />
[05:32:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: pokemon ranting</span><br />
[05:32:34] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ah</span><br />
[05:32:42] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I have a question for you FL</span><br />
[05:33:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically my theory that in the pokemon universe, V-Create was used instead of the atomic bomb.</span><br />
[05:33:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeeees?</span><br />
[05:33:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: If you take someone's virginity, do you now have two virginities?</span><br />
[05:33:33] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: meaning you're actually twice the virgin they are</span><br />
[05:33:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[05:33:42] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: :P</span><br />
[05:34:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Next question.</span><br />
[05:34:12] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: also</span><br />
[05:34:23] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that seems a bit odd of a theory</span><br />
[05:34:30] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I mean, it's plausible</span><br />
[05:34:32] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but odd</span><br />
[05:35:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there is a US Force still left over in Kanto back in Generation 1.</span><br />
[05:35:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lt. Surge.</span><br />
[05:35:28] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: what does V-create even look like?</span><br />
[05:35:41] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: maybe not V-create :/</span><br />
[05:35:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And, Victini is found in Pokemon Black and White, which takes place in Unova, which is New York, which is a part of the US.</span><br />
[05:36:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: V-Create is the most powerful Fire type move. Period.</span><br />
[05:36:05] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: it's not really a large scale move</span><br />
[05:36:21] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: while it might be the most powerful</span><br />
[05:36:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, Victini is a Legendary Pokemon.</span><br />
[05:36:36] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I don't think it would have the scale of the atomic bomb</span><br />
[05:36:47] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: other, more spectacular attacks might work better</span><br />
[05:37:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its also the most powerful non sacrifical move.</span><br />
[05:37:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right under Explosion and Self Destruct.</span><br />
[05:37:54] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: if anything, Doom Desire, Sacred Fire, Techno Blast, or Judgement might work better</span><br />
[05:38:06] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: maybe blue flare or bolt strike</span><br />
[05:38:32] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: what if Smergle was an atomic bomb?</span><br />
[05:39:10] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: nah, that's dumb</span><br />
[05:39:37] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: V-create doesn't really cover a vast area</span><br />
[05:39:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves'>http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves</a></span><br />
[05:40:43] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: it has a relatively small explosion</span><br />
[05:40:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In pokemon lore, legendary pokemon are basically physical gods.</span><br />
[05:41:47] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yeah, and?</span><br />
[05:42:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Victini is a legendary pokemon.</span><br />
[05:42:16] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: well the moves I mentioned are also signature to legendaries\</span><br />
[05:42:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, but none as powerful as V-Create.</span><br />
[05:43:03] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'm not saying V-Create isn't powerful</span><br />
[05:43:18] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: what i'm saying is that it isn't the most spectacular explosive attack</span><br />
