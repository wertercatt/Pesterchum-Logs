<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I... how...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, I think the glitch might be getting worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's wrong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just wen't into this temple, okay? And I went around some corners, and I should have been completely turned around...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But... what I find is a long hallway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THIS MAKES NO SPATIAL SENSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you may have found an entrance to what Replay Value refers to as the Skaian Magicant</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's basically kind of like the "maintenance tunnels" of the game, a network of weird spatial shit accessible through glitched walls and other shenanigans</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, it does look rather different, and I wasn't looking at where I was going...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...This seems like a good place to stop...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And for some reason, I still have one transportalizer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, its more of an emergency link back to my home, but still...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Should I use it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: make a note of the location, then come back later</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know how I got here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the magicant is technically outside the session yet not in the furthest ring proper, it might be useful for later</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And I don't know how to leave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, in that case just remember what temple you were at, transportalize home, and check it out later</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll just set up a transportalizer here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And come back later...</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's what you do with it, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The problem is how far you're willing to go for it, and the price you're willing to pay</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Especially since whatever the plan is can only go horrifyingly terrible for us in general.</span><br />
<span style="color:#280262">CRR: ....</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For now? We're not in a right sorts to go after that guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#280262">CRR: It's complicated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: PSA personal vendettas are liable to earn you a teleport punch to the face along with a heroic speech immediately afterward</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I thought that was suicides?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: They're basically the same thing.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I actually have the means to teleport punch in the face</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: i αm getting ready to fight you fl</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Could you maybe tell us what''s so complicated?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I wanna smash that skinny black bastard's face in just as much as anyone else, maybe moreso, but if I ran out and tracked him down and fought him I'd almost certainly have my ass handed to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, said teleport is actually the creation of teleporting... so, you can't match it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So we could maybe help you out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: i'll be there soon</span><br />
