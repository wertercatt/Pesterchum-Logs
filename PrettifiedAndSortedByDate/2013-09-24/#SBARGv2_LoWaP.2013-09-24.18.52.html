[08:21:29] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Which the others do NOT know about.</span><br />
[08:22:01] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...How's da new body treating ya? Made it myself.</span><br />
[08:25:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a8a87e">[CFF]</span>  waits for his response. --</span><br />
[08:27:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Decent. Bit cramped, but not a cramped as a pair of shades.</span></span><br />

[08:28:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I believe you brought me back for a reason.</span></span><br />
[08:28:43] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: So uh... do you know why things happened the way they did?</span><br />
[08:28:58] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: And the Reason is simple- you think. you are alive.</span><br />
[08:29:04] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...couldn't let ya die.</span><br />
[08:29:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I assume that Athena had a hand in it?</span></span><br />
[08:29:35] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Uh... No? I did it on my own.</span><br />

[08:29:45] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...I don't think so.</span><br />
[08:30:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">That seems a bit to... major of a reaction for just blowing up a denizen.</span></span><br />
[08:30:19] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Also, a friend of mine, who will not reveal ya existance and loves robot and AI's wishes to talk to ya,</span><br />
[08:30:37] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: And uh... you kind of Used anitmatter. suddenly.</span><br />
[08:30:41] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Without warning.</span><br />
[08:30:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...I might have over reacted.</span></span><br />
[08:30:56] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: For Reasons we don't really understand.</span><br />
[08:31:08] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...Yeah, no shit sherlock.</span><br />
[08:31:46] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: That kind of scared alot of people.</span><br />
[08:32:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">And by might, I mean there was quite a few reasons, most of which I cannot disclose due to your existance as a player.</span></span><br />
[08:32:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Sorry.</span></span><br />
[08:32:27] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...and what do you mean by that?</span><br />
[08:32:57] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Also, asking yaagain, someone wishes to speak to ya. Do you want to speak to her?</span><br />
[08:33:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I shall speak to this mystery person, but I have an idea that it may be sarah, due to the female pronoun you just used.</span></span><br />
[08:34:15] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[08:34:27] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Nope.</span><br />

[08:35:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I shall speak.</span></span><br />
[08:36:21] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Thank you... Also, sorry bout the body- Would try yto make it humanioud, but it would ahve been stupidly big, or really tiny.</span><br />

[08:38:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  appears out of motherfucking nowhere right by FF, actually looking genuinely concerned for once. Upon spotting the rover, she almost immediately gives him a hug. --</span><br />

[08:38:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...Hmm.</span></span><br />
[08:39:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">So, if everyone assumes I am dead, is FL doing a funeral?</span></span><br />
[08:39:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Or have I lost that right?</span></span><br />
[08:40:02] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: I... dont' know. I told FL what I was doing but...</span><br />
[08:40:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I suggested it earlier.</span><br />
[08:40:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He mentioned some reason he could not.</span><br />
[08:40:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I now see why.</span><br />
[08:40:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...Ah.</span></span><br />
[08:40:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Would you be fine with being called Alan?</span><br />
[08:40:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I still have a few files in my m-</span></span><br />

[08:41:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I believe the best thing to call me right now would be Joshua.</span></span><br />
[08:42:01] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ..Hmm... nice name.</span><br />
[08:42:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Of course, perhaps that is in bad taste.</span></span><br />
[08:42:19] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...?</span><br />
[08:42:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I thought Alan for the Turing Test I originally planned to give you.</span><br />
[08:42:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  laughs, then. --</span><br />
[08:42:44] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...the what test?</span><br />
[08:42:58] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Turing Test. To measure a machine's intelligence and/or possible self-awareness.</span><br />
[08:43:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Alan Turing created it.</span><br />
[08:43:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Joshua, however… Heheheh.</span><br />
[08:43:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">The Turing test is a test to determine if an AI can be advanced to the point where it cannot be told apart from a human being.</span></span><br />
[08:44:14] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Ah thank you, Joshua and Gambit.</span><br />
[08:45:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Excuse me as I check if any of my extra files made it over in the transfer.</span></span><br />
[08:45:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Good, there they are.</span></span><br />
[08:45:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">And I managed to keep minesweeper this time.</span></span><br />
[08:46:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  … just hugs him more. --</span><br />
[08:47:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( is FF getting the hug, or is it DT? ))</span><br />
[08:47:20] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ((DT, FL.))</span><br />
[08:48:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is totally hugging the robot. --</span><br />
[08:48:11] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  does this. --</span><br />
[08:48:17] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Heh...</span><br />
[08:48:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...It is unfortunate that I do not have touch receptors, or something other than a cold metal exterior.</span></span><br />
[08:48:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Other wise I would hug you back.</span></span><br />
[08:48:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm glad you're alive. Hm… do you want a more humanoid body?</span><br />
[08:49:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can easily have Zen bring one of the models he controls directly over here… there really wouldn't be much of a mind to override.</span><br />
[08:49:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">This machine is fine.</span></span><br />
[08:49:42] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...You Sure?</span><br />
[08:49:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay.</span><br />
[08:49:54] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Also... Joshua, what is it that ya want?</span><br />
[08:50:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I am currently in the progress in rewriting the control firmware, so it better be.</span></span><br />
[08:50:59] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey, all I'm saying is I can get you a more humanoid or humanoid-reptilian one.</span><br />
[08:51:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … you're still huggable though. Don't worry.</span><br />
[08:51:32] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Okay...?</span><br />
[08:51:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">It might be best if the fellow AI's are told of my survival... at least the ones who are in ca/hoots/</span></span><br />
[08:52:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">As well as other, non player entities.</span></span><br />
[08:52:30] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't have any idea what you're talking about. *says this quite firmly*</span><br />
[08:52:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit's <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG'S]</span>  glassestop, however, pings. --</span><br />
[08:53:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...In laymans terms, may I please speak to Lyra or Sarah in private?</span></span><br />
[08:53:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sarah?</span><br />
[08:54:05] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Uh... I have no idea who Sarah or Lyra is.  Sorry.</span><br />
[08:54:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">sorry, Alice</span></span><br />
[08:54:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Joshua. I don't know what game you're playing. But let me make it very clear that I am /not/ involved, and you will stop even hinting at it, or what you're playing at all.</span><br />
[08:54:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">There was a quick file bug.</span></span><br />
[08:54:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...understood.</span></span><br />
[08:54:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Incidentally, Alice happens to be able to hear anything and everything I can, and see as well. And I'm pretty sure she happens to have access to my pesterChum account as well.</span><br />
[08:55:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But I'm not accountable for her and don't know a damn thing she's doing, sooo...</span><br />
[08:55:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I completely understand.</span></span><br />
[08:55:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm glad you do.</span><br />
[08:55:37] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...ah. okay?</span><br />
[08:55:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I will say, on the record, that using antimatter was a bit much of a card to play.</span></span><br />
[08:56:03] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...again, no shit sherlock.</span><br />
[08:56:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No clue.</span><br />
[08:56:51] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...AG, He Blew up a fake denizen with anitmatter.</span><br />
[08:57:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">It might be best if I lay low for awhile.</span></span><br />
[08:57:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: My thoughts exactly, Joshua.</span><br />
[08:57:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Incidentally, would you be able to make a back-up copy of yourself?</span><br />
[08:58:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Any such backup would be affected by changed in my other systems, unless I were to destroy them.</span></span><br />
[08:58:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">A bit of a side effect from being quantum in nature.</span></span><br />
[08:59:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Could you make one to be kept dormant somewhere that's entirely cut off from the outside world as far as communications or data goes?</span><br />
[09:01:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Possibly.</span></span><br />
[09:01:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">However, is that not what I am right now?</span></span><br />
[09:01:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Cut off from the outside world?</span></span><br />
[09:02:01] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...currently, yes.</span><br />
[09:02:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Another one, so that if someone learned of your existence and acted to destroy you, they would be met with… quite a bit of resistance.</span><br />
[09:02:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *shrugs* Merely a thought.</span><br />
[09:02:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Right now, such a measure would create a branch off from me.</span></span><br />
[09:03:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">It would be like a brain scan of a brain scan like me.</span></span><br />
