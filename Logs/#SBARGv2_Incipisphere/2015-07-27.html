<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: hey, there's still ways to get out of it ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: for some reason gramps said we had to get the fuck out of the meteor a few weeks ago and go back home</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: we have forever to get it done, so we likewise put it off forever</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((RN has just naturally become so jaded and edgy, like, it's one of those "you have no control anymore" situations))</span><br />
