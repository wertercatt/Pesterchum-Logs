[11:17:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...that seems a bit more major than just trying to doom the timeline.</span><br />

[11:20:02] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That was because of something that /you/ did</span><br />

[11:20:15] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How did you... How did you even /start/ to go Grimdark?</span><br />

[11:20:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, grimdarkness would be contact with others, even indirect, right?</span><br />

[11:24:54] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: what?</span><br />
[11:24:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because since I don't have magical means to pull it off... it /must/ have been technological somehow.</span><br />
[11:25:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which would imply use of the implant.</span><br />
[11:25:23] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Meaning...?</span><br />

[11:32:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I've tried to break it in the past, but it always comes back.</span><br />
