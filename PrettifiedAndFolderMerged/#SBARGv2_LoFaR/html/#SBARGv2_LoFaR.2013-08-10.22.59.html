<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#538d79">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: â€¦ Why suggest it to /everyone/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: You /know/ what you said about Chronos lurkering and knowing stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I know, but we have to tell enough people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#538d79">CAG: And, seriously, Ash and SV...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So, plan rundown one more time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We can use Ash and SV maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now, plan rundown.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Open with grinding, open with finishing up your denizen quests and god tiering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then we end with a session wide team up to get our shit together, literally, and go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We either distract Chronos and kick his ass where Time and Space are meaningless, or we bait him into losing himself and come back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We head to an empty Inicipisphere, we finish this fight, or we come back and finish it here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or this plan is so totally ridiculous we bait Chronos into playing on /our/ terms.</span><br />
