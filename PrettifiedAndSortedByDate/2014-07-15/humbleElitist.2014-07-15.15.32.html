[15:33:07] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: I haven't even tried logging back on, incase its considered "ban evasion" for what might just have been a kick</span><br />
[15:33:22] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: except it was chanserv that did it and now I'm confused</span><br />
[15:33:39] <span style="color:#a1a1a1">HE: /* it said EA at the end of the message */</span><br />
