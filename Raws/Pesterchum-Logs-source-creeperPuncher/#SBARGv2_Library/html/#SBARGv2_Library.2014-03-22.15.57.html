[03:57] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  rises up to the ceiling, shaking out the sun-shaped hood, causing the environment around to shift and change. Looks like they're in a massive cave. --</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  Yaldabaoth switches position to the middle of this massive cave, NV and CP still position just where the terminal vanished, and off to the side. Off to the right of them, what Yaldabaoth is facing in all his fury is a door, and through that door comes walking.. --</span><br />

[04:00] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  this girl again. This time she has broken glasses, and looks worn and torn and distraught to her bones, limping to the lair wearing nothing but a pullover and jeans torn into shorts. Not a pretty sight in the least. Her breath is haggard and she looks absolutely terrified. Also, I gotta brb. --</span><br />
[04:17] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  Yaldabaoth looks down on this little girl who just walked all up in his turf, leaning down to look her in the eyes. --</span><br />
[04:17] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">So this....this is the new champion..</span></span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  yelps, screams, and falls back down, cutting her hand on the sharp walls of the lair as she gets knocked on her behind. --</span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: W-What?</span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">Hm...you don't even know why you're here....I would have assumed your guides to tell you..</span></span><br />
[04:19] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: (Think we can buffer forwards or backwards?)</span><br />
[04:20] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I know why I'm here, I'm here to uh....d...defeat you!</span><br />

[04:21] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  is carefully considering the situation. --</span><br />
[04:21] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: I assume she can't hear me.</span><br />
[04:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it's still just a hologram.</span><br />
[04:22] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  pulls herself to her feet, putting on a brave face...before it fails completely. She sniffles a few more times and takes a limping step forwards, actually looking like she'd try and fight this thing. And fail, obviously. --</span><br />
[04:23] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  Yaldabaoth laughs, a deep and hearty laugh that shakes the walls, coiling up and leaning in to get inches from DT's face. --</span><br />
[04:23] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">Defeat me..? Yes, maybe...but you are here to accept my Choice, do you understand?</span></span><br />
[04:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I dunno, I think I might just spectate this time. I have a day's worth of stuff to catch up on...))</span><br />
[04:24] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  shakes, sniffling and letting a few tears out before she throws the most half assed punch imaginable at Yaldabaoth's snout. --</span><br />
[04:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  doesn't really react. is a behemoth of a snake. --</span><br />
[04:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  continues throwing punch after punch at Yaldabaoth, they just bounce off his snout until her knuckles are bloody and she feels half blind from the brightnes. --</span><br />
[04:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  +s* --</span><br />
[04:26] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">Child, your session is dead, killing me now will do you no good.</span></span><br />
[04:26] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">Not that this pathetic display is nearly powerful enough..</span></span><br />
[04:27] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: D...Dead? W-What?</span><br />
[04:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Dead?</span><br />
[04:28] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: Just watch the show, kiddo. Dead session. Happens all the time, from what I've seen.</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm older than you unless you're more of a twat than I imagined, and dead sessions don't happen like /this/.</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  gestures to the scene like "check dis shit" --</span><br />
[04:30] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">Your session is dead, Hilen, and no amount of injury to yourself will bring it back. Your universe will never create another one, nor will it ever breed a successful session. I am simply here...to offer you alternatives, however extreme they may be for a mistake such as this.. </span></span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: W-What? Why?!</span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">It is just the nature of the game when one joins alone.</span></span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I didn't join alone, there were 6 of us! We were all together! </span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: We didn't make any mistakes we just started up the game for fun!</span><br />
[04:33] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">Maybe...but you joined from one place, deployed your materials in one place, and it's been dictated...that this session is Dead, regardless of what may have happened..</span></span><br />
[04:34] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">So now I have taken up residence in your planet, and I shall not be leaving until you make your Choice...this planet is mine now, you are just an unwelcome guest.</span></span><br />
[04:35] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: wow, kind of a blunt way to put that.</span><br />
[04:35] <span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: This is my planet, o...our planet! Get off it, this is mine! Mine, can you hear me? I don't care if it's dead or alive you can't have Earth!</span><br />
[04:36] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dissimulateTempest <span style="color:#00bcbc">[CDT]</span>  throws another few punches at Yaldabaoth's nose, knuckles bloody and blinded by tears..and well, sun-tier light from the thing's head. --</span><br />
[04:37] <span style="color:#000000">CDW:  <span style="color:#ebca0e">I will take that as a willingness to accept either Choice, as I don't wish to speak to a crying child..</span></span><br />
[04:38] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  ...TO BE CONTINUED --</span><br />
