<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: I thought there was a particular reason you linked a jawdrop pic</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because I am just so confused at how are we even getting this many new players THREE MONTHS into the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: it is rather perplexing isn't it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: the sudden influx</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Maybe it's the glitch or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: :?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: AC, was telling me about a how you thought it was a glitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: he explained how fucked up a lot of the session was</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it might have to do with that weird message in the main tag after bakagami was revealed</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Weird message?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me dig it up</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, autoplay warning</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe it was ripped off of a strange server in the furthest ring</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: My land is full of all this spice</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: all kinds of spice</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is it old spice?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (hehehehehehehehehe)</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: What you need to do is season any meats you have.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: that kind of new.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: AC didn't tell me about the memo until a little while ago</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Have you found your role yet, as a doom player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Not yet, I'm new too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Correct. My land is nothing more than a giant ball of snow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: With some static storms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I may as well do an intro too. I'm Kimura, resident "that does not go in an alchemiter" expert of the Land of Snow and Crystal. also a Light Player and half-wolf.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: nice to meet you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Heh. My land is entirely burnt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: One of my friends is a light player</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Sometimes you'll find party instruments.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMO</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: he said he would visit the memo later</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Formal introduction, on my behalf. I'm Hank Peterson, Leader-in-function of the players of this session, host of the headquarters on LoIaR. And a Sylph of Doom.</span><br />

<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh. and to think I was getting used to being the only Light Player in this corner of paradox space :P well, it should be interesting to meet them. *woof*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: He's from the land of Dust and Fire</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I wonder why paradox space has chosen to give us a inlet of such a copious amount of new players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm Niki, second-in comand of team spectrum (whatever teams bounderies even mean at this point) and sort of a tagalong in most important happenings. I'm also a Time player, but that's sorta moot until i find my time leg again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alright. I'm Robert, less-oft known as Raz. All-purpose mechanic to the gang, resident smith and expert in all crafting matters, and self-appointed second-in-command. Planet's the Land of Spells and Echoes, Aspect's Heart, and joking class is Craftknight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Perhaps the glitch being worked away and paradox space finally doing it's job correctly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: maybe you'll need them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Pleasure to meetcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ooh, and Leader to Team Exseize, can't forget that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk. it's like a large chunk of our session has been time-offset from entry, like that slow-teleport throwaway line in half-life 2</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Also know as the most hardcore band of asskickers that don't actually do anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: I got a lot of the lecture about the session from AC</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: A couple of us only wandered into the memo after losing our own teams to Voldemort's gate explosion thing, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oha yeah, we should probably mention, we don't really call the bad guy by his name around here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, it's a bit of a trigger to one or two players</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so we just call him either Voldemort, or Bakagami</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or more formally, the Douche of Space and Time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: how'd he get two aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: I want two aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ....no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: motherbarking cross-Scratch shenanigans is how, apparently</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You really don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and seriously, NO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: it was a joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I thinught it was because of that thing we had to do with aspect codes earlier</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Throwin' around one force of reality is hard enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I'm sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Introduce two, and... Your body can't even handle that, chances are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: twas a joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If you say so.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: try not to breathe fire from the hot sauce</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We don't mean to judge you like that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, but it might be important</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: I'm worried it might be a boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, just remember that you get to choose your own pace at these sorts of things.</span><br />
