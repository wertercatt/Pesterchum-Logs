<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ITS NOT A VISUAL NOVEL YOU IGNORANT GAIJIN</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: AAAAAAA</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: "weeb shit" isn't a joke, by virtue of not being funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's actually an RPG with an interesting/slightly annyoing battle system. So, natch.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: at least i do genres instead of specific ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I love how you don't get a fucking weapon until the end of this flash game</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey, AC.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: hm?</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its just funny to see you get sent into a nerd rage</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's not nerd rage it's more, nerd annoyance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I have a thing about things that're patently wrong, especially about things that I like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: look i get the core concept of fsn and its kind of cool ill even acknowledge</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but it also has a cast of anime girls that look like theyre 12 and you even fuck some of them in the vn so its kind of an easy target</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: plus you get so flustered about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Look another patently wrong thing. There are a lot of things you can knock it for but there's exactly one chick who looks like she's 12 and that's because story reasons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (Shirou don't fuck her either she's kind of his step-sister. And older then him. So /ew/)</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: THEY'RE JUST EXPRESSIONS OF WESTERN IMPERIALISM YOU IGNORANT GAIJIN</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't know why it'd be an issue unless you plan on butchering those for the sake of unfunny jokes too, and I think that'd be a lot harder without moe art dredged from the depths of Danbooru.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (actually i'd be impressed and a little scared if you found some of that for a military movie)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: challenge accepted</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...does crossover fanart count?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (Fanart's not bad it's just a bad basis to build an assumption about a series around)</span><br />
