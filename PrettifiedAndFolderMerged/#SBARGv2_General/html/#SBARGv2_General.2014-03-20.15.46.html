[16:05:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (much fun very yes)</span><br />
[16:06:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, on another topic, does anyone know of a bukkit mods that could impliment a respawn timer?</span><br />
[16:08:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kinda thinking of having a respawn timer that respawns everyone when it runs out, and when someone dies, it adds 30 seconds to the timer.</span><br />
[16:10:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So if two people die at the same time, they have to wait a full minute before they both respawn.</span><br />
