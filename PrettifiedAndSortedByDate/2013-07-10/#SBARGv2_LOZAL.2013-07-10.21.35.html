<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  should have never zoned out while those pancakes were being made --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  zoning out is totally an excuse for ooc not paying attention to anthing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  should really stop being so freaking moody --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  It's a grey, flat land with a green, cloudy sky --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  small buildings are scattered across the land, the tallest structure being the dwelling Spire I just walked out of, wearing a bucket hat --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  lands already --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Yo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hey!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: There's this hill I like to go on. We can get a good view from there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  points to the only hill with grass in the whole land, albeit orange grass --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  captchalogues her broomstick and sees the dwelling spire in the distance --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  begins walkng towards it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Alrighty, sweet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows the others --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  saunters toward it, smiling slightly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: So, guys, what's been going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I haven't been around much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is halfway to the spire --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  we're going to the hill, aren't we? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... we got mega-trolled by Bakagami earlier. both in the memo, and a VISIT X2 COMBO at the HQ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Trolled? How?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is almost not lost, still separated from the group --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Those who needed oxygen had difficulties at the second visit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Oh. Glad I wasn't there. He would have killed me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mostly psychological warfare, with a bit of the Spacey Thing toward the end :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Well, the old me would have died.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SB, for some reason I was only partially affected by the "revocation of breathing privileges", as someone put it earlier... not sure if because sprite powers or just wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Now I probably would have just sat there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: huh... thats odd, I suppose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AB had a much harder time with it though, even though I had brush-portaled her to the basement...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I heard about that... EQ was talking about it to me before she went into mopemode. :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Sounds like he was just playing with you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Thats bakagami's thing, i guess. He is really immature...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  finally spots the group --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey guys!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  runs towards them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup again</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Oh, Hello SJ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Yo</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, it's been a while since I've seen you, Mike</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: was almost a bit worrie</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *worried</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Really? Why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Indeed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, you were off sorta out of contact, and only popping up occasionally to mention heroBrine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I had get myself together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I reinvented myself-</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Though, I guess I'm a bit more boring now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Eh, whatever you say...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, you said something about a meteor shower really soon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Yeah, in a few minutes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  finally gets to the hill and sits, sighing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Been a while since I left the Spire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Feels good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks over at PO, a strong hint of worry upon her face --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sits down nearby --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  sky starts to light up from the meteors, the clouds opening --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Hey, It's starting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also sits down, looking up at the meteors --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sogBot <span style="color:#955311">[CSB]</span>  glances at PO, after that one comment, and takes a seat, just in time. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks up --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  they fall at great speed, some speeding right by  them. A light smile crosses his face as he turns his head to watch --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Wow, look at them. They're everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is clearly kinda freake out by the closer ones --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *freaked</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, this is cool. but, uh, you sure we're safe up here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Relax. Everything is fine. Those look like meteors, but they'll disintergrate into grist the second they touch anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah, so it is a special effect. I kinda figured as much...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  nervously looks up at the FALLING DEATH STARS OF DOOM that actually aren't even deudly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Ah, thats nice...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Yup. I guess It's unique to my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  leans back, relaxing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: You know, It's nice to be among friends again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  attempts to calm down and act rational --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  isn't doing very well at calming down [diceroll 3/8] --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  (relaxing touch dice roll 5/7) touches Niki's shoulder. "It's okay." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just disregards the Metaphor Dice and continues watching --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  one meteor crashes right behind us, leaving glowing orange grist --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Wow. Look at that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks over at PO, mood improved mostly, but still a little jumpy  --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sogBot <span style="color:#955311">[CSB]</span>  is startled by the sudden grist-meteor crash, and jumps slight a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Anybody want the grist? I have no use for it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what kinda stuff does orange star bit grist make?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Good question...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs and walks over to collect it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Future type stuff. Get some of that and iron, and you can make Star Wars esque stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ooh, nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Lightsabers, laser guns, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ooh, that sounds cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I don't use weapons much anymore, so take as much as you like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: you don't... use weapons? How do you defend yourself then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I haven't left the Spire, so there was no need.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's more thanone way to get through a confrontation</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Besides, I still have my shield and pistol. I just don't use them much lately.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well, yes granted...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it might be a little hard to do a pacifist run in this game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I'm...taking a break.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: A long one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Ah?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  returns after collecting a lot of the grist --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Um...yeah. </span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Why so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  seems kinda concerned --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I just want to be more help to the other players, and what I was doing before...got in the way. Besides, I can't really fight anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: So I'm just gonna stay back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well, I suppose thats fair (if you think that of yourself), but still I don't understand why you can't fight anymore...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: My spirit is gone. My fighting spirit fueled everything I do. It also got in the way of things, and almost got me killed almost every step of the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...did something happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: After weeks of meditation, I got rid of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Well, nothing bigger than usual, but I just had time to think recently, and....yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((wrong chat))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((was loking at that burger pic CP posted))</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: ((Lol okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((pfffffffft))</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I... can't say that I think any of this is good or wise... but if you honestly think thats what you need to do, I can't stop you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Until I find a true reason to fight again, I'm just gonna stay gone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... all I can say is, make sure that when you /have to/ fight again, that you /can/ fight again. in other words, at least do a bit of practice once in a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I just hope that you don't stay cooped up alone. That sorta thing isn't exactly the best for mental health.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: yes, please...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Oh, don't worry, Brucebatsprite is training me hardcore. </span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and also what Niki said. this is not a game for, ahem, lone-wolfing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: He decided to train me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (oh dear frogs why can I not stay away from that one specific pun)</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm, good then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Well, with as many people Done Tiering, I thought that was new.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: ((I mean, normal))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Sorry...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I thought we were starting to get into a routine as a session... do stuff at the cafe, go explore a dungeon on someone's land, return and talk about it, do it again the next day...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Ah well....</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: True enough, CP...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but what happened earlier today with Bakagami's double visit... it reminded me that ultimately, we do have an end goal to deal with, one that's coming up frighteningly fast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Yeah, I feel it too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Good luck, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Yeah... I do wish you players all the best luck with it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: So, CP, what are you gonna do with that grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure... you said it's good for future-tech, so I might experiment with the codes I got from The Grid the other day...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or I might just release it into the session's Grist Gutter and see if anyone else can make stuff with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Cool. I could tinker around, if you need it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: That's one thing I'm still good at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  the meteors sprial around the horizon, creating a sort of dome around the planet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  everything becomes bright --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm... how pretty...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ooh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Wow. This is cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: But they're all about to come crashing down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Grist will be /everywhere/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stares up at the bright  --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  "so, I made this." He holds out a magnet with a button. "It's a Grist Magnet." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ah, nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  "try it, SB." He hands it to Sogwa. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sogBot <span style="color:#955311">[CSB]</span>  takes the grist magnet, interested. She has no idea how to use the thing, but she holds anyways. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Press the button.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT sogBot <span style="color:#955311">[CSB]</span>  presses the button on the device --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  grist from before quickly zooms to her, adding to her grist --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: See?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ah, indeed I do! Nice!</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: That'll make dungeons much easier! I made a few more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: You guys want one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sure</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: 'course!</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Everyone here is insufferable at times. That's just how it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but at least you know what you're doing, unlike some of the folks I've gotten to meet over the past few days...</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Huh /indeed/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  grumbles something about AB --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh. some of these newbies... seriously.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Well, I guess if you put it that way...</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe481a">[CPO]</span>  an orange and blue sprite appears out of my necklace. "WAAA what are you thinking!? WAAAA your training is incomplete! WAAAAA You must stay. Waaa." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Ah, hello sprite!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of stares at the sprite --</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: "Waaa</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: ?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: When it comes to the training... Why not have other players spar with PO? Everyone has a diffrent fighting style, and a varity is good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: That way, PO can also travel to other lands, and still has a lot of new training oppertunites, imps and such aside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's true, actually. the more experiences he has, the better a fighter he can become.</span><br />
