[07:39:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think 1v1 would be more fun, but maybe thats me</span><br />
[07:39:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So make team battles /another/ event.</span><br />
[07:39:58] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We need the practise -.-</span><br />

[07:44:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just do everyone in 1v1s.</span><br />
[07:44:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And anyone who /wants/ to build teamwork skills can do 2v2s! :DDD</span><br />

[07:45:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll do both!</span><br />
[07:45:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but lets just focus on 1v1 for now</span><br />
[07:46:09] <span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Why not arrange them both at the same time? If you are already compiling a list of interested blokes, it would be simpler to add names to two lists instead of going back and asking later.</span><br />
