[08:38:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay</span><br />
[08:39:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: fair enough.</span><br />
[08:39:14] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'll give you a detached version. save you any of my rage and what have you.</span><br />
[08:39:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Alrighty...</span><br />
[08:39:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FL was doing his thing. Kinda being a twit at same points, but he does that and we know it.</span><br />
[08:39:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No big deal.</span><br />
[08:39:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed</span><br />
[08:39:49] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It happens.</span><br />
[08:39:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Whatever.</span><br />
[08:39:50] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: mhm..</span><br />
[08:40:11] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FA began to wrap her head around the idea that he had somehow adopted her "Old personality".</span><br />
[08:40:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Despite him being a Rogue and not a Thief.</span><br />
[08:40:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So already we are in the territory of illogical thinking.</span><br />
[08:40:48] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I see.</span><br />
[08:40:48] <span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: what's the difference?</span><br />
[08:40:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, she has be becoming more like me... before the sprite incident.</span><br />
[08:41:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The version of me before that.</span><br />
[08:41:16] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: IA continued to point out, and try to reason with her, that FA was acting like the aforementioned "Old personality."</span><br />
[08:41:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FA continued to be extremely short with her and proceeded to yell at her time and time again.</span><br />
[08:41:51] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Despite IA being rather civil, not raising her voice, not swearing, or being rude.</span><br />
[08:41:57] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FA eventually exploded.</span><br />
[08:42:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Boiled over.</span><br />
[08:42:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And left.</span><br />
[08:42:06] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: When she returned.</span><br />
[08:42:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah...</span><br />
[08:42:46] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: She began to parade around claiming no one cared for her and manipulated FL into feeling sorry for her, as we can see now, despite her being completely unreasonable.</span><br />
[08:42:52] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: When, once again, IA pointed this out.</span><br />
[08:43:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: She exploded again for the final time.</span><br />
[08:43:11] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And left after yelling in everyones faces.</span><br />
[08:43:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:43:20] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah.</span><br />
[08:43:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  dumps more salt on the text. --</span><br />
[08:43:33] <span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: i should have just...left her alone...</span><br />
[08:43:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: If you wanted, I could show you the entire log and you can come to your own conclusions [which would honestly be best] or you can take me at my word for it.</span><br />
[08:44:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: IA, you were trying to help, c'mon.</span><br />
[08:44:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You didn't know she'd react like that.</span><br />
[08:44:25] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If it's not much trouble, can you please show me? If it is, then never mind.</span><br />
[08:44:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: None at all.</span><br />
[08:44:41] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Thank you.</span><br />
[08:44:52] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'd rather people come to their own rather than have people like FA parade around manipulating the situation.</span><br />
[08:44:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Hell.</span><br />
[08:45:02] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: My exposition even can change it's appearance.</span><br />
[08:45:08] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No better in that respect.</span><br />
[08:45:52] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what's that one thing everyone uses?</span><br />
[08:45:55] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: tinypad?</span><br />
