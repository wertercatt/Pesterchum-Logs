<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oi, you ignorant little shit, that is /enough/. You are /not/ threatening him. I will fucking end you if you so much as /try/. He's speaking sense, a.k.a. that your fucking moronic ideas are liable to wreck shit and get people killed, so stopping you from enacting them is generally considered a /good/ thing. You've got all the brains the dead old god gave boiled lima beans and /way/ more</span><br />
confidence in yourself than that intelligence score warrants.<br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: You keep thinking that asshoile</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Frankly /you/ and your petulant insistence on getting your way and acting how you desire, when those ideas are /dumb as shit/, are probably a bigger threat, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: *asshole</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Please calm down all of you!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Especially if you're all talking shit and acting like an unstable PKer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You, however, do /not/ get to threaten my moirail.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: incase you were too stupid to figure it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: it was an empty fucking trheat</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: *trheat</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: *threat</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: ((god dman))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: ((FUCK)))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh really. Well the part where I said I'd end you if you so much as tried to hurt him? /Wasn't/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Leave him alone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TV. That wasn't the point. Drop it. AG. It's done. Move past it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sir, yes, /sir/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So what's this all up in about? You guys can't throw out opinions on how to proceed with butting your heads together like a group of knuckledraggers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Get it together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: FS has been doing this for two days</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: maybe if he weren't such an asshole and would STOP</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: there wouldn't be an issue</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: i've clearly said multiple times that it bothers me, asshole</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: so fuck off</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: I'm simply trying to prevent AC/TV from startin<span style="color:#730e8f">g brand new issues in the session</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FS? You take on the situation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: FS, I SAID FUCK OFF</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TV cut the chatter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: because now that th<span style="color:#730e8f">ey're all finally done with</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: we certainly do <span style="color:#730e8f">not need more</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: We already do</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Both of you lock it down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: according to AG my suspicion was correct</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: What's this all about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm not asking why you can't get along, I'm asking what you're arguing over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: FS let AG explain it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: AG, would you care to explain</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The current issue appears to be that you were planning retaliation against either EQ or myself for "doing something crazy/stupid"-- as you'd mentioned both in the past, I'm not sure which it is anymore-- and FS stepped in to tell you not to do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Alright,</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Now TV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I was planning a retaliation on EQ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I want you to explain why you wanted to retaliate against EQ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: because i'm very much suspicious she's not mentally capable</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and as i've said NUMEROUS TIMES</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Mentally capable of what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: it was in the event that AG's plan failed</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: (mad)</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and she and Athena tried to do something really really dangeorus, stupid, vile, idotic... I think you get my point</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: You may not have noticed, but this is the first time I've talked to you. Let alone met you. So please, understand I know absolutely nothing of what you've said before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No I don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: uuugh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: What are you suspiscious of her not being mentally capable of?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Her denizen is fucking with her</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm aware.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and she may or may not be mad with power...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /Thank you/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Now. What is it that makes you believe you should retaliate against AG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: AG says they have some kind of plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: but they won't tell em</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: *me</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: so i'm not completely sure how good the plan is</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So your plan to convince her to include you, is to attack her?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: in the case that she fails, i've prepared a number of plans to retaliate against her and her denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: (or she, I don't actually no AG's gender and for some reason i feel like its classified :P)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Who is TV by the way. and Gambits gender is yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (it's not so much classified as it is /not constant/...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and usually, you can assume Gambit's a girl)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (/usually/)</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: It's AC, this is basically just a weird bot thing that i'm using to send messages because I don't have hands free to use the computer</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: not constant...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: okay then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: meh</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: anyway, its just a back up in case AG fails</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TV. Would you allow me a moment to explain to you as to why you should remove yourself from the situation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: SE I forgot to mention something</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: she mind fucked with her powers...</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Now, will you allow me a moment to explain to you why you should remove yourself from the situation?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: And no one bothered to tell me about this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: With you now insistently throwing yourself into it all you have placed us in a position of uncertainty and unease.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TV, I asked for a moment to explain. I hoped that it was implied that it would go uninterrupted.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Because the nature of dealing with EQ and their respective denizen was to remain subtle and not to draw to much outsider attention, it remained unspoken and kept amongst trusted individuals who were either involved or needed to aid.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *maid? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus there is the problem that aging is the deteration of cells... a slow "death" to say the least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So... if you are god tier, you won't exactly age much...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, not past a certain point at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: well... I age mentally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, you do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and since apperently you guys like to discredit me for age</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if you are asleep that entire time, you won't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: mental aging only works if you're experiencing things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: well what if I made a time room thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not trying to discredit you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean like that one from DBZ? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes, actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FL, you might not be</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: in 100 years, we won't be complaining about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but some of the players try and discredit what I say because of age</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's not just age, it's maturity level ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so maybe a stay in a time room would prove something</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Well if I matured in the time room</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, we just discredit you because you act like a stubborn child.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: made it some kind of virtual reality</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And maturing alone would just drive you insane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: was forced to live there for a few years...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: come out in like 15 minutes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, have you ever seen castaway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: No?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I recommend you watch that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think i'll do it</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, I'm willing to bet you just waited some and posted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ((also, the entry message isn't coming up, does someone need to re-register))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously, /watch it/</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and don't come back for an hour.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You don't seem any different.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: what, I can't tell a joke?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, how was it there? boring? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: It was weird...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yes and can the next break between our meetings be even longer a wait?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "for realsies" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: for realsies?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Oooh! </span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Anyway, it took me about a day or so to rig up the thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so I was in and out almost instantly</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I programmed the reality thingy to basically be an AU of Sbargv2</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .\</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so shit gets real, then stops getting real, then gets more real, then gets so fucking real that craft mayo isn't even that real, then it just ends</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and i'm here!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you spend all your time on LoCaL or something? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Which planet is that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Land of Copper and Lasers</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh, no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it... kinda poofed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I basically just wondered around...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: watched teammates get killed</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: watched them ascend</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: then get killed again...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: it was kind of depressing, to be quite honest :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how much did I die</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but also fun :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: You died like... once</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and then ascended</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and now I'm creeped out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <a href='http://mastermoridin.tumblr.com/post/69435793768/somepretty-things-vvidget-chocolate-food'>http://mastermoridin.tumblr.com/post/69435793768/somepretty-things-vvidget-chocolate-food</a> ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: why are you creeped out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, looks like it departed from reality...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, because you really died way more times than that? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1: Dreamself death 2: Ascention 3: CHAOS DUNK</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: There was like... a completely different set of circumstances</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: no Chronos or the blue hole...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, you forgot that one picnic with AG. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Weirdest thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh right</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FL ended up being the calmest person ever</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and never needed to get laid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: not even once</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right, I think your reality was busted</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Well it wasn't meant to reflect perfectly</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: most people were different</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: except strangily CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: CP was exactly the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what do you mean by that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps it was trying to reflect a realistic session, but all it had was your memories?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yeah, maybe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: anyway, I think I know what SE meant now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What did I prototype in this... "AU"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: a cat and your dead grandmother, I think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: You were calling it grandcatsprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so either grandma or grandpa</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I don't have a cat, so this was vastly different.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: The Black King was insane though, because someone I guess somehow had access to the first guardian who wasn't ornis</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, if I was acting exactly the same, then I still self-protoed with a plush Ammy toy and stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and someone else had access to the fucking horror terrors</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also wait shit what</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: 'CP: universal c<span style="color:#730e8f">onstant?' o_0</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH FUCK</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, was it the desu guardian? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes, CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: everything was exactly the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: desu guardian?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FS: he said AU!me was identical to regular!me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: SJ was like... 10</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: old headcanon about the (fake) guardian. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: shit was trippy, I think it mixed my memories with a scenario I wouldn't be ready for</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: it's an amusin<span style="color:#730e8f">g idea though</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I don't think so then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I really didn't put that much thought into the AU at the time</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: TBH I could have gone braindead</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did anyone use antimatter in the AU?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Ye</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since apparently I was calm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and surprisingly</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: It actually worked</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who used it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: who used it though? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and EQ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait a minute... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: wha</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I knew about the SCP event.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it knew*</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Yes, SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...nothing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think EQ was much older...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: late 20s</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: When have I ever shown any signs of wanting to use antimatter though? ... other universes are Odd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes EQ. yes they are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I think like... 3 people were genderswapped</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: It was all over the placed</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: *place</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: good old gender-swaps... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FS turned out to be evil</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: then saved the day at the end for some reason :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: We also had to fight Hearts Boxcars who prototyped</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: it... wasn't hard</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Boxcars went Ringwraith?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: and with our heavy prototyping</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: h<span style="color:#730e8f">uh</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00e100">CAC: he was pretty much too much of a hideous clusterfuck to even move</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe i can actually get to know you fuckers on the other side</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I have no intention of leaving someone to be alone for an obvious reason</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it's still boarding at the station? :P))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: not just SL. Anyone feels like staying, i'm staying as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I wouldn't reccomend that option for yourself, personally. You still have a job to do in the new universe, and this session will start to get "old and bland."</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Plus, add on the troubles I am certian some lands are going to face in the future...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, think about it: A small snowy land, with some consorts. Right now, it wouldnt be that big a deal. But later more consorts will come along, and that means that more food will be needed, which could be difficult to farm on the land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Think of that as example a.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: EQ, you must understand though that that is a part of advancement</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: it can't be helped</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, I do see your point... even taking into account Fahr Pizzaria's apparently alchemiter-powered infinite pizza ovens, it wouldn't last forever...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats a reason i should stay, then</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: SL, you would be effected by said troubles as well, you know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: someone needs to help</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It's simple darwinism: if they can't learn and adapt to the contstantly changing situation known as /life,/ then they die. This applies to all creatures.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm sure lands will band together to help out one another along the way, but even then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i cant let that happen though</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: SL, it isnt a matter of letting that happen. It /will/ happen. It'll take a long time, sure, but that sort of thing just happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: don't defy the natural order of things</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: When I mean a long time, I mean a long time. Could take a few generations to a couple thousand years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and i will do what i can to hold it off</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its what amy would have wanted me to do</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: SL you can stay but don't take that upon yourself</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Can you create things en mass with no cost whatsoever? That would be the only way to do much of anything permanent. That, or have every creature be 100% focused on cooperation, farming, and survival. Which can't really happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: as i've told EQ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: strife and advancement go hand in hand</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i can do what i can</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I still do not agree with that statment, by the way. </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I know you don't, but its true</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: wwII is a perfect example of this</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Let's not get into this argument once again, if you would please.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: this is mainly for SL, EQ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what are you even trying to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: think about it... if they need to find a way they'll be forced to</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that i should beat the shit out of consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">. . . . . . . .</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well cross that bridge when we get to it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Okay let me explain SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no i know the concept</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: in WWII we were forced to find ways to advance</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: the jeap is a- oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: anyway, let them do as they need to</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i've basically advanced my planet to the modern age by these means</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so SJ, what's up with this lore you were talking about</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still typing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so no copy paste then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm focused on multiple things at once gosh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: nah, I was just under the impression it was saved as a document that could be copy pasted</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm typing this from memory. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we should find a hub planet if we all end up going to the new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: where we can all meet up and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">that's kinda the plan. to find a planet where we can all live on.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: See, SL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what kind of planet were we thinking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we're fucking immortal gods so we could really live anywhere, I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">obviously an earthlike planet would probably be what everyone looks for, but yeah, technically anywhere that supports life</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i might find an ice planet to hang out</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: or should i say...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so are we just going to build houses all over the place or have a little community?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 5/5 SL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I kind of was hoping they'd have school where we go, technically I need to finish school</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: hopefully a system at least similar to Earth...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: All depends if a species has already evolved to that point on some planet in the universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: Earth had a vast array<span style="color:#730e8f"> of education systems</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It bothers me that I have better chances with aliens than I do with humans...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hopefully it would be like sweden's, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">well, Sollux did say that the universe's timeline is independent of the host incipisphere, so there's a good chance the game will /deliberately/ drop us at a point where sentient life already exists... and hopefully near one of said planets, as well.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: anyone just want to travel around from planet to planet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hmph. It'll be interesting convincing the creatures there about how you are basically their god, but then again: just blending in might be a goal of some peoples.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I wonder if we'll find a group of people physiologically like humans</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">oh yeah, that reminds me: we need to remember that, Space Players and tech aside, interplanetary travel will take a LOT longer because the planets will be realistically sized and spaced.</span></span><br />
