<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  stumbles outside into the open air. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  stretches and looks around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: whew.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  uncaptchas hot chocolate and drinks it while standing out in the brisk air --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads outside --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is following CP, a few blankets in hand. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  stares at the stars in the sky. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I haven't looked into the sky since we got here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I forgot how pretty it was...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks up... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Really now...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  sleepilly looks up at the night sky. Stars are nice... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  is seeing basically this <a href='http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3318/3495695552_c6eed45aa4_o.jpg'>http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3318/3495695552_c6eed45aa4_o.jpg</a> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess we all need a reminder that we didn't just make one planet, we made an entire universe and we need to explore it at some point...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  nods a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I wonder what is taking that so long, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  shrugs. "I guess prep just got screwed up..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I mean... Didn't DS say that everything was set up?... hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...although I also feel slightly responsible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Why...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Well, during the days we were supposed to be prepping, I was in the middle of a break down and coma...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh... and naah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah, don't think it was your fault.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  shrugs and sips the hot chocolate --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: they have had more than enough time after that... to make up for any lost time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the day we did the test run, something weird happened and we all 'portalized back, but DS took his sweet time returning...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I just remember oogling the science tech for the entire time, then suddenly being in the forest...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  mumbles something about wanting to see what the tech did --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, it'll happen sooner or later...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Remind me to nag DS about it later...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  yaaaaaaawn --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  uncaptchas a couple blankets and pillows on the stone patio. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  lays down on them and stares up at the sky --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'Wonder what sort of trouble we are gonna get into, out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nothing we can't handle ;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  smiles a bit and digs through her pockets and finds the little figurine. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  holds it up and looks at it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is tempted to howl at the moon for ironic purposes... but the moon isn't visible --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Tch. True enough. Eitherr way, lots of yelling and chaos will be involved.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Addmittably, I kinda missed that, here. Not as many stupid and dangerous situations to get into.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: eheh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And its stupid for me to even slightly miss that, I know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  glances at the tiny figurine IB has. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Watcha got there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, after nine months of shenanigans, a sudden lack of shenanigans just feels /wrong/. like, insanity is our mental baseline or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  is holding a small featureless Seer figurine with a Doom themed tassle tied to it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...a gift</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Ah. I see. From who, if you don't mind me asking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Figurine from...  Silas. The tassle was from Ash.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Aaaah, okay. Noted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...You said you wanted to talk to me about this EQ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -That I did. You are right. However, its honestly kinda late now, and I doubt you want to be nagged at a time like this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: It's fine...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I can take it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Besides, I am faaaaar too sleepy at the moment...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  yaaaaawn --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yaaaaaaaawn... maybe that's our other problem... nothing much happens around here, so we've fallen into a /routine/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I think a lot of people wanted to talk to me about it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Gasp, how shocking CP! It must be fixed at once-</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... and yeah, maybe. I think so, honestly. If anything, I'd like to discuss about how to go about that, but eeeh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is tempted to just fall blanket first onto whatever snow may be left, really. Sleep... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Hannah-chaaaannn jooin meee</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Meeeeh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  confused look --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs at CP --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  just, looks up from the blanket on the floor --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and I just realized all three of us are witches okay. That is my cue to return to blanket narnia for sleep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: witch partyyy</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Wooooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But yeah... tell the stars goodnight for me, and I shall see them all soon... Niiiight...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: niiiight</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  wobble-floats back inside. Prime objective from here on out: Sleep. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  captchas the figure. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...did you want to hear about the Seer of Doom thing...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I'm kinda curious about it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm guessing it was one of your teammates or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Short version? She was someone I loved. She wasn't a teammate no, but she agreed to play the game with me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: After entry, we had talked and wanted to meet up as soon as we could...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...but that time never came.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Like my team, she no longer responded.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I assumed the worst.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: But never got confirmation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so you don't know for sure if she died, or if something else happened... but at this point, the chance of her surviving is basically nonexistent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  nods. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dang...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I think the reason... that I wanted to stand out so much during the final battles and events...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: was to get her attention... to make her know I was there, and make me easier to find...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...but that didn't get me results either...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: which is why I assumed the worst happened...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ah, I see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  sighs a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I know there's no evidence of an afterlife being a thing in our session... but I still like to think the people we've lost, both on earth and in the game, are out there /somewhere/ in paradox space, watching us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  nods. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I... really hope she is doing well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: but at the same time....... i feel obligated to wait for her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: but if I wait all my life... and she is dead.............what have I waited for...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: It's... so hard to let go...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: but letting go feels like I'm giving up....</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, if she's still in the game... the End Door will never despawn, so she'll still be able to get to the Starter Planet and contact us from there...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and as for "giving up", do you think she'd want to see you just wasting your life waiting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...aint it romantic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  says bitterly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........I dunno what to say... I guess, do what /you/ feel you should do, and keep hoping but not to the point that it's the only thing you ever think about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...honestly, I'm just lost...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, we're all here for you if you need us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  looks at the sky with a thought filled face. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CEQ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads back inside --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  gets up and captchalogues the things before heading back in --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CIB</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
