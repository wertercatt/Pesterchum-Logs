<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so i just got done with my japanese final</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how'd it go? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i am decently confident i passed</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (i did /horribly/ on the oral portion though)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (she asked where the library was and i told her where the bookstore was)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (/incorrectly/)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (ouch)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh man, giving directions is always a pain. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i told her it was under the main building because i forgot what to the left of was</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so its some sort of moleman library i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I remember the oral portion of my finals... fortunately, the way Masako-sensei set it up was that, she gave a list of questions and we wrote and had her check the answers over /in advance/, then the oral itself was that she'd ask randomly chosen questions and we'd have to answer from memory.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well she at least let us answer in english and get most of the credit but</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm guessing yours was entirely on-the-fly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and yeah it was</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  glances at his wanikani review pile that's been fermenting for a while... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: in other news either of you guys ever seen akira?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...think I saw part of it once, but it was a long time ago</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2d8a18">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you probably should soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i have some character plans id like everyone to properly appreciate</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ugh. notepad, why you fuck up newline copypasta when wordwrap is enabled &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well SL, I finally wrote the thing I will probably regret linking as soon as I hit enter. <a href='http://pastebin.com/5VEu4NTr'>http://pastebin.com/5VEu4NTr</a> (technically nsfw)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yey</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ok you do realize that eridan and sollux are both male right</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so tavrissprite is the only troll sprite that applies</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I know. what I said was, gender /doesn't matter/ in troll reproduction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah but then you didnt mention fefeta</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: either way this is acceptable</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but it still leaves the question of doggy dick up in the air</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically, I gave a canon example for all four possibilities of matched/unmatched gender and species, is what that part was about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i know</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so yeah lets /never bring this up again/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably a good idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so i feel the need to randomly ask if ive achieved this life goal</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: has anyone actually played super ghouls n ghosts because of my influence?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure about outhers. I haven't played it yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *others ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well its on both wii and wii u virtual console according to wikipedia</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: which also has a beautifully spergy gameplay section</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I haven't either, mostly because I'm too lazy to get it (and not sure if I even have points left on the wii shop)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and theres always emulation</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (which has like a split-second of lag thats unbearable to me because im used to the real thing, but wouldnt be a problem if you were introduced to the game with it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if I ever get the chanc I'll probably pick it up, considering how many (non-transferrable! &gt;_&gt;) wii points I still have. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also i understand that wii u vc has rudimentary save states?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if so do not use them for sgng trust me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (yeah, that's probably how I was gonna do it, emulator-ways... heck, I might even use it as a test stream when I finally have enough free time to do that)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: accept that you will never complete it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and if you have voice capability when you do i might give you a skype call and coach you</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah to get maximum enjoyment from sgng you need to accept that you will never complete it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so just have fun with it, try out different weapons</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (seriously get the knife was good advice in the original gng but if you only use the knife in sgng youre ruining the experience)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so it's kinda like FTL and NetHack then? play it for the experience, not for completion</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ive never played ftl but yes to nethack definitely</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though it isnt as randomized</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i havent even beaten the first loop and its still my all-time favorite game</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (i assume the fact that you have to beat the game twice is common knowledge?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (I never even knew that) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (yeah, I think it was mentioned in the AVGN video?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (yeah its because of the series's arcade roots)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (you beat the last level and youre told you need a more powerful weapon to beat the final boss)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (then youre sent back to stage 1 on an even higher difficulty and the new weapon starts to spawn)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i should really make a gng series weapon demonstration</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just for reference</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: all the weapons in gng on both arcade and nes (the nes game is a super-inaccurate port and a lot of the weapons are different), all the weapons and spells in gng for genesis, and the weapons, upgraded weapons, and spells in sgng</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and then i guess all the weapons and spells in ugng for psp even though they arent connected and also that game is terrible</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because im sick of digging through longplays for reference</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: especially in gng for genesis, which ive barely played</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so imma brb</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: am i the only person in v2 who actually unironically likes cheesy glam rock vocals</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its like the one thing im not ironic about</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like i dont even quite know why</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i guess its that you can really feel the passion behind them?</span><br />
