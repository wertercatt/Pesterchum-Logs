<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: dude, hurry up and eat the life shroom already. it'll at least stop your hp loss</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the life shroom comes in contact and presumably a nice healing light washes over him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  or does it have to be eaten --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is totally and completely unconcious --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  nah, just touching works --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: I have the burn salves and the organic bandages.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  immediately steps into action, tearing off RS's jacket with a STRONG!pull, and uncaptchaloguing a wooden crate full of vials, salves, bandages, and kits. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Okay nurse, I need some help.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  whips out a knife and hands it to CP handle first, tapping his chin for a few seconds before hastily and quickly bringing out 3 different salves and 2 kinds of bandages, tearing the shirt even worse. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Remove or roll up the right pant leg.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  rolls it up, considering it's the less-violent option --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  begins applying 3 different salves to the burns, then bandaging them up to the best of his ability, screw delicacy and tact lol. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  while waiting for NV to ask for a thing, uses Lv5 Sweet Feast to give all three of them a small HP boost --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  applies the salve to the leg, and holds out his hand for the bottle, sitting indian style looking more focused than at all usual. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  hands NV all the bottles that look like that... you really oughta color-code these things better --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  frowns and looks between them, taking the yellow one and sprinkling the golden liquid on his leg bfore bandaging. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Camel piss, heals it all faster.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  makes a note to alchemize less-gross things for NV later --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  and also makes a note to chew his past self out for being a dumbass and NEVER THINKING TO CAPTCHAROID THE MEDIGUN FROM TF2 FOR JUST THIS SORT OF SITCH --</span><br />

<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Kidding it's a thing called Djinn's Draught, it'll heal and set crippled limbs, but nothing but limbs. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  the salves would sting slightly, and the Draught would be feel like you're suddenly swimming in warm and fluffy jello --</span><br />
