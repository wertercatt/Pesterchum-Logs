<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Sorry about the quiet... I can assure you, its almost never this quiet,  especially here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#00aefe">[CAH]</span>  points to CP. "That's kimura. Due to shenanigans, 'e is part amaterasu. Expect a lot of those... shenanigans, I mean." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Not Kimuras... Unless there is a bit of a cloning thingy in the future, then I don't really know what to say.</span><br />

<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: ...............</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, its too late for me to suggest running away from all this... So, welcome to the closest thing to "insanity incarnate." Have fun, and try not to die. People in the memos will help if needed, and yadayadayada...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT geekyDoughnut <span style="color:#4ec6b4">[CGD]</span>  is easily scared, and just looks at AH in shock for a minute --</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: what......</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: did i walk into?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: The rest of your life, or at least until you die or get the ultimate reward. Again: Have fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: 0-0</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Players, consorts, denizens, underlings, and death abound ~â™«</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's okay, you'll get used to things soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Your life now, player. I wish you luck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#00aefe">[CAH]</span>  snerks at CP basically just saying that you will get used to the insanity and death... mostly because its true, and dang that is seriously the norm now... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: (( also, orei is a girl ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: So orei... may I ask about your land? Who's the denizen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: you mean what my land is or whatever?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yes, and hoo the denizen of the said land is. You must know by now, right? </span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: .....</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#00aefe">[CAH]</span>  mumbles "'nother player not knowing their denizen...  me mean so much though... gotta know which friends are where... ugh, just..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hey kimura: is it against the bacafe rules if I turn into a giant snake thing whilst I  properly explain what exactly a denizen is to the new-kid?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no idea. you'd have to ask Kat...'</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Because thats what most denizens are normally like, sooo... but wait. Ceiling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, size constraints...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ugh... I'll try it another day in the bacafe... ANYWAYS!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: .........</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Orei. New kid. Don't know what a denizen is, right? Well, you happen to be asking the perfect person!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I happen to /be/ a denizen. Not of this land, but it still counts! Athena's the name, nice to meetcha!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: ..........................................................................................</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: um</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ssso. Denizens. Often big-snake creatures. Some have humanoid forms, like myself, however.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: They control the underlings- ah, yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... You are awfuly quiet, and I am going to aranea-levels of rambling, huh? hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, to summerize: Denizens are big boss-like creatures that control the lands underlings. Many, if not all, are named and based off of some figure in mythology, often greek. Many denizens offer choices, but those normally suck, and most denizens as a general are unlikable, in my opinion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT geekyDoughnut <span style="color:#4ec6b4">[CGD]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Every land has one, meaning your land has one as well... and yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#00aefe">[CAH]</span>  yawns --</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Have fun meeting your denizen... I do hope its not one of the jerkier ones... more "friends" to deal with.</span><br />
