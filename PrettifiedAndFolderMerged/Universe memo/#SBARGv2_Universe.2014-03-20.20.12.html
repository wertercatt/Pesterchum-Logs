<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: But I think you're thinking players are actually like, good at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would it be unfair to blame the uncohesive maturity level of most of the players on tghe fact that the session happened to have been glitched partway through? Like, considering the game is "supposed" to have a sorta coming-of-age theme, what if all the code screw-ups had something to do with that too? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: If this is what you guys call "coming of age" I'd hate to see you before it started.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Much is possible. There were many glitches.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And another, smaller book to translate that one!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: You seem to be 'covering your bases'</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((there's a chance I probably won't be able to show up due to obligitory job hunting and/or parents trying to keep me offline with chores -_-;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My bases are covered like the most skilled baseball team!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I'm about to hit a home run!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { :c that sucks }</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This sounds likes a positive metaphor</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course it is, I'm so positive it's unpleasant!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: How does positive lead to negative?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because you can't be positive unless you've been negative!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, granted, not in the world of electronics, but more in the realm of emotions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or the catharsis involved.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I assume that I must take your word for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But this is definitely the one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I still have yet to figure out why a battery's "output" end is considered the negative end...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Because whatever is using the energy is taking the positive energy</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because the positive side tastes the best, obviously.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I do not understand</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The positive side of a battery has a nub, and you can check the charge by putting your tongue on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: N_V ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Your tongue tingles if there's still a charge, so the positive side "tastes" the best.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This is strange logic</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's a rule of thumb, not really actual logic</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: If I had a tongue i might have tested it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll lick some batteries for you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some more "rules of thumb but not actual logic", this building smells like evil.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I do not understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You ever smell something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How is that even possible?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I have no lungs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I can assure you that sprites can smell</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'm not literally smelling anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((XD this is so confusing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((nix anything that was not correct then. replace with silence v.v))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { whoops sorry }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { I mean sprites can bleed so they definitely do have some measure of bodily function }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Rather I'm taking a bunch of observations and various sights and my intuition tells me bad things. So, I smell it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((i thought that maybe since it was never protod with anything living it might not have blood v.v;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { At the very least, Jadesprite cries, logically you need some kinda bodily function to cry }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { and she was a stuffed person }</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((still living at some point. can we stop talking about it? &gt;.&lt;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { sure, i was just throwin out random things anyhoo }</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((sprites tend to take on the qualities of the concepts behind the prototyped items rather than jst the literal qualities))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((take that how you will, I'm definately not an expert))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well here's something. Ammysprite was also prototyped with a plush toy, and was a living, breathing sprite BEFORE Kim self-protoed.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Deerscope sprite had a telescope for a head. }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { ....I don't know if it could breath. }</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so there is in fact precedent for the idea of something being more important than literal aspects))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((even though i asked for it to be DROPPED. fine. whatever))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { We're just throwin around sprite stories m8 }</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((no...you're throwing around sprite theories based on the conversation I asked to be dropped and discarded))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { riiiight okay }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe this yellow stuff is toxic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ..Nothin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also it's late, I'm out, peace.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((...I appear to have missed everything and caused somebody to get angry))</span><br />
