<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should I be watching the abridged version?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that's Despairstuck!Kimura only, and blame Monokuma.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, So I know an AU we could do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It wouldn't give any advantages for later AU's though, but it might help out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, he made a joke at a camera, Monokuma came out and dumped fries in his pants, the bear now ships Kim&lt;3Fries OTP, and Kim himself just wants to get out of that cargo ship))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uplink.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that's true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hopefully near the end, and with as many people as possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since we won't get any advantages, nor will we be able to use any.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I assume with us on the "stopping Revelation" side...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, unless we do a successful Battle Network or Digimon AU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we... probably shouldn't touch either. considering that merged AU you got locked in last time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about a Minecraft AU?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I'm so sure about the ending point, but it could give us an advantage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And it would give me an excuse to run a survival server with a mission. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( :O ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I'll be sneaking some written books in. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, I could actually pull off a merged AU and get it done faster...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I forget, what's the point of finishing AUs again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In order for us to locate where the viral entity is within the AU Machine so we may take it out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, didn't know it was a legit virus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: --in which case, I wonder about a Code Lyoko AU...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: assuming the virus is an AI and actively partitipating in sims, it'd be forced into the role of X.A.N.A....</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then we just go explore Replikas and download its code directly from the Towers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, unless it runs revelation on Lyoko.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, Uplink probably /would/ be safer. even if no matter what AU we do, we're never at risk of real-world bodily harm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, should we try to pull off a merged AU?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: merging which things again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Homestuck and Minecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...yeah, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Alright, now I have a map to load at least. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Should I bring up the server now or wait for more people? ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Haha!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know how I said that an AU would be unsuccessful if all players were to die when in the AU?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, due to the way Minecraft works, I've managed to hack together a "respawn" setting. As long as we don't all die at once, We should be able to continue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There /might/ be some delay before you respawn...</span><br />
