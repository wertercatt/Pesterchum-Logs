[08:55:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And FL has his code too, but is lying about it</span><br />
[08:55:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: As he fears what his class will be</span><br />
[08:56:11] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: Aww, what a shaame.</span><br />
[08:56:59] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: :3 what is it?</span><br />
[08:57:00] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: :DD</span><br />
[08:57:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: let me check</span><br />
[08:57:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: infiltrate.html...</span><br />
[08:59:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: any idea what that is?</span><br />
[09:01:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...rogue of heart</span><br />
[09:01:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Oh gog seth wasn't lying</span><br />
[09:01:15] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: Aww yiss</span><br />
[09:01:16] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: perfect</span><br />
[09:02:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But FL hasn't stolen anything in the session other than Seth's grist! and has been running a legit business selling honey to his consorts at decent prices!</span><br />
[09:04:09] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: :3</span><br />
[09:04:16] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: It would still make sense though.</span><br />
[09:04:27] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: Because rogues steal for their friends.</span><br />
[09:05:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Yet FL would avoid god tier and rung 612 regardless, even if he was something like heir. Because he is afraid of being labeled a thief or destroyer.</span><br />
[09:06:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Aka 1/3rd of all the classes</span><br />
[09:06:12] <span style="color:#ff8b00">SV: :D He'll probably have to die eventually.</span><br />
[09:06:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: eventually... plus that crypt is in his sylladex, waiting for him.</span><br />
