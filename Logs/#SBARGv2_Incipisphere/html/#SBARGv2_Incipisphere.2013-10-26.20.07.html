[08:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: explain what a lusii is, Rob.</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's a simple request. probably only needs a short sentence long answer</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically animal monster guardians.</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A fantasy animal that serves as part-parental figure, part thing-to-be-taken-care-of.</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: A lusii is a guardian of a weird bug alien that doesn't exist</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh oh.</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, like a grandmother who had two strokes.</span><br />

[08:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anywho.</span><br />
[08:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: alright Rob.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: now, i'm certain it's safe to say that we all know what a lusii is then.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and in the current given setting, us all being people having grown up on earth, that we know what a cat is</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd rather not entertain the drop-dead stupidity of referring to "parents/guardians" as lusii</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: PK even happens to have a word for cat in their name,.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how quaint.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's like "holy shit guys my life is nothing more than homestuck"</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: as such.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm certain we can all alude that they know what a cat is.</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /so/</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What the fuck is this conversation.</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: since we all know a cat isn't a fantasy animal</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: augh</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i guess that means PK was referring to the latter part of what you said</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ....</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it is a part parental figure part thing that needs to be taken care of.</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: now.</span><br />
[08:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh, hang on, do you hear that?</span><br />
[08:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: most people can generally dissect the meaning of what PK said.</span><br />
[08:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i understand if you're a little slow, what with all that self you are so full of.</span><br />
[08:35] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: now are you going to finally cut it with the holier then thou act you put on whenever you hear someone reference homestuck?</span><br />
[08:35] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause i'm certain no one jumps down your throat when you make an anime reference.</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: "Cats think they're lusii" no cats don't know what a Lusus is and no matter how much you try and make it into him making a comparison that's not what he said.</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#aaaa00">CPK: ...</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how about this.</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: PK.</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's a difference between an anime reference and "I don't get out much"</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I can't</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what did you mean by your statement of "CPK: so cats think they are our lusi?"</span><br />
[08:36] <span style="color:#aaaa00">CPK: I meant like how they think they need to care of us is like lusii taking care of trolls</span><br />
[08:37] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Objection.</span><br />
[08:37] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Leading the witness.</span><br />
[08:37] <span style="color:#aaaa00">CPK: objection</span><br />

[08:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Overruled.</span><br />
[08:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Overruled, the both of you.</span><br />
[08:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Continue.</span><br />
[08:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Objection, none of us are judges.</span><br />
[08:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Overruled, logic is inate here.</span><br />
[08:38] <span style="color:#aaaa00">CPK: as lusii are believe to hunt things to feed their trolls, cats bringing in freshkill to feed us is like that</span><br />
[08:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sustained.</span><br />
[08:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Right.</span><br />
