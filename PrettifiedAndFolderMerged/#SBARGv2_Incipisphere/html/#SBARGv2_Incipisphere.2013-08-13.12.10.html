[10:07:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: how useless</span><br />
[10:08:19] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: ... That goes back to my original question: /why would you keep anti-matter on hand. You know what that stuff does./</span><br />
[10:08:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but matter is also destroyed upon contact with /antimatter/</span><br />
[10:09:01] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but you literally have to uncaptcha it next to the thing or it will disappear before you can even use it</span><br />

[10:09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: destroyed in a /massive explosion/</span><br />
[10:09:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats not how antimatter works at all</span><br />
[10:09:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: one gram? three hiroshimas.</span><br />
[10:10:29] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Considering that one could consider dust, or even gaseous stuff (LIKE OXYGEN) to be matter...</span><br />

[10:11:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: just as soon as you expose that stuff to matter everything around it just stops</span><br />
[10:11:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right now I have 1 kilogram of it.</span><br />
[10:11:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />

[10:12:50] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: actually try that im kind of curious now</span><br />
[10:12:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A massive ammount of uranium.</span><br />

[10:13:07] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: huh</span><br />
[10:13:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: id expect it to be like the one thing that costs artifact but ok</span><br />
[10:13:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: uranium grist is like the cost for nearly all exotic matter and radioactive stuff.</span><br />
[10:13:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no man.</span><br />
[10:14:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Stuff that actually costs artifact is like the big rigs truck.</span><br />
[10:14:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...can you make the big rigs truck</span><br />
[10:14:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I did, once.</span><br />
[10:14:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because that would actually be insanely useful</span><br />
[10:14:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It made it out of the session.</span><br />
[10:15:03] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you can pass through shit and go up walls a-</span><br />
[10:15:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And crashed into a meteor.</span><br />
[10:15:06] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: pffffhahaha</span><br />
[10:15:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... I remember that. ➜</span><br />
[10:15:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on its way back in</span><br />
[10:15:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: it didnt go through it?</span><br />
[10:15:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, a meteor is ground.</span><br />
[10:15:22] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: do you still have the code</span><br />
[10:15:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i might actually want to use it</span><br />
[10:15:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Captcharoid it yourself.</span><br />
[10:15:45] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe combine it with the lunar whale and see what happens</span><br />
[10:15:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, didn't the meteor wind up going backwards in time due to the acceleration or something? ➜</span><br />
[10:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No that was the truck going through the furthest ring.</span><br />
[10:16:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: was the truck going in reverse</span><br />
[10:16:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I vaguely remember some sort of time shenanigans ➜</span><br />
[10:16:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was going faster than light still.</span><br />
[10:16:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and not going backwards through time.</span><br />
[10:16:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so do you think the truck is going to show up in someone elses session now</span><br />
[10:16:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, somehow it was breaking the light speed limit.</span><br />
[10:16:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It did</span><br />
[10:17:03] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: really</span><br />
[10:17:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It came back into ours.</span><br />
[10:17:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: amazing</span><br />
[10:17:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And crashed into the meteor.</span><br />
[10:17:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: LIKE I JUST TOLD YOU</span><br />
[10:17:35] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i need to make one of these</span><br />
[10:17:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: no one man should have all that power</span><br />
[10:18:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I told you, use a captcharoid.</span><br />
[10:18:28] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but is it worth it</span><br />
[10:18:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: does this thing have the potential to destroy everything</span><br />
[10:19:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. I remember that stupid truck now...</span><br />
[10:20:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, it ignores the speed of light...</span><br />
[10:20:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so maybe?</span><br />
[10:20:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doesn't have infinite energy though.</span><br />
[10:20:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: could i doom the session by making this truck and combining it with my ship</span><br />
[10:20:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think it got to a max speed.</span><br />
[10:20:49] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: I would not try it, if I were you.</span><br />
[10:20:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe thats what creates the blue hole.</span><br />
[10:21:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: everyone making big rigs trucks</span><br />
[10:21:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ill make a copy and keep my original ship</span><br />
[10:24:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah, I think that thing follows γmc instead of γmc^2</span><br />
[10:25:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or something like that</span><br />
[10:25:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where it just keeps going faster instead of taking progressively more energy to get closer to lightspeed</span><br />
[10:27:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: almost got it...</span><br />
[10:27:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THERE</span><br />

[10:28:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
[10:29:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Takes a ton of time to fill it up...</span><br />
[10:29:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe I might be able to do captcha bricks ( 11111110 ) to fill it up in groups of 8.</span><br />
