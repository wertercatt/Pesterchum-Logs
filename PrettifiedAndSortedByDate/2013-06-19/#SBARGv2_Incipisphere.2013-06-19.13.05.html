<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((you don't have to NN, NN's not here))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: IA, if you start doing those math problems where Susy can only take two guys to prom... I give up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((it was thematically apppropriate considering I IC wanted to rip her head off for similar reasons))</span><br />

<span style="color:#6c000b">CIA: No way to find a solution without getting the problem first</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or just apply enough illogic 'til you go through nonsense and pass out into Wonderland.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then it doesn't matter anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: why was i hushed for stating a fact its not much of a stretch</span><br />
<span style="color:#55557f">CUD: Can Those Corrupted Forge A Clearer Path Than Even They Can See?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ooh, and Leader to Team Exseize, can't forget that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk. it's like a large chunk of our session has been time-offset from entry, like that slow-teleport throwaway line in half-life 2</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oha yeah, we should probably mention, we don't really call the bad guy by his name around here.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so we just call him either Voldemort, or Bakagami</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or more formally, the Douche of Space and Time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0055ff">CRM: how'd he get two aspects</span><br />
