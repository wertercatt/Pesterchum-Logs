<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Ars Magica and Thaumcraft are the main magic mods, which involve a large degree of research.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All of Chickenbones mods make it alot easier to run things away from the base (might add portal gun, but nether portals might be enough)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tinkers Construct allows for making awesome tools, while Factorization and Applied Energistics allows for massive amounts of storage and... MISC stuff.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think DS said the test-run target planet was ~5LY away, so that's a good search radius...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: SL's ship, though? Isn't that still around?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, but it doesn't have a warp drive</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Nakdrive</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: we will fly with the power of Nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Bleh. So, we either just sit around, somehow aquire a warp/nak drive, or go out into space and have it take a TON of time to find DS.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: was that the "launch with nukes" thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More like /propel/ with nukes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all we could build it in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or carry it into space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With our sylladex.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And flight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ......</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ who needs muclear propulsion when we can fly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PE, we can't fly /fast/ enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: PE, do you know how long it takes to fly a zillion miles into space? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ well, it would take some time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ for me to calculate</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ but its a big number</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, too long to be worth it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: PE, lemme put it this way. try to imagine going from one end of a MC world to another, with only creative mode flight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, we wouldn't have to worry about time dialation if we had you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ that's not too bd</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ bad*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats.. basically that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ minecraft worlds are only 8cks the size of earth</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ 8 times</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah, but with /creative mode/ flight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but you do see my point though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ im just wasting time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ or</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ i could be slowing you down for evil purposes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ :p</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, we could use time travel to arrive in time, but for us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ who knows</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I know a spell τhaτ speeds up my flying speed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either method, we would still need SJ else its gonna take 3 years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ what if she flew there starting now</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ then traveled back in time by 3 years</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ tada</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ im a fucking genius</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 Years as a /top speed/ without space warping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you know how boring 3 years of flying in a single direction would be? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: chances are it would be much, /much/ longer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE:  ~   ~  <img src='smilies/apple.png' alt=':apple:' title=':apple:' /> </span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm pretty sure it was Prometheus messing with my clock.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all he /did/ have it before we fought him by the heart of my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, true. but still, the point is Chaos Dunks are bad juju</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So basically Aranea/Slick level clock manipulation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Leaning more torwards slick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Chaos Dunk is a horrible idea, and my name is Charles.</span><br />
