<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: "Unfortunately, the scale also has a loading on neuroticism, which correlates with the introverted end."</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Last time I checked, the test doesn't even test for neuroticism. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> meant that the other way around</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span> has:</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">1</span>: no test-retest reliability, you get different results the same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: i know, i'm asking what about MBTI is being talked about EP</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">2</span>: the different scales are correlated, and not as independent as claimed</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: SA, NN's saying it's all bullshit :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">3</span>: it doesn't handle for psychopathological attributes</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Unless you're building characters :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">4</span>: about a third of published material on it is about how sucky it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">4a</span>: and the published material on it that's about how good it is has its /own/ material about how that study wasn't following the scientific method correctly</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And how would you go about handling for psychopathological attributes? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span>'s a fallacy</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: "let's see you do better"</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span>'m not a psychologist, I can't do better</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> I can still tell you that that's bullcrap</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">like</span> how I'm not a doctor</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> I can tell you eating weeds isn't going to fix your cold</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Again, though, maybe it helps some people.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">yes</span>, it would be accurate that if a psychologist said it was accurate (and showed their work)</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Even if it's not some solution you're looking for :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">then</span> it'd take precedence over me</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: "Although we do not conclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI developers’ theory-based assumption of categorical “types” of personality is invalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in IRT-based MBTI scores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was previously available to “type” advocates to cite in defense of their positio</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">aka</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: ow</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: "According to us we think that there might not even /be/ types, because of how these statistics work"</span><br />
