<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay SL just get the parenting subplot on with it doesn't need to end with blackmail and excessive villainy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but any suggestions for where to take it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......what is the subplot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like what would Quinn do and what would Amy realistically do</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......i dont understand it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It seems like a total cop-out subplot</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: RS' plot is kind of</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what do you mean nv</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......i was about to start up a little sub plot thing for PE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......a dungoen thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Which is ridic because it lasted some 4-5 dungeons spaced out a number of weeks but, yeah, he's pretty mcuh finished.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#78120b">CURRENT dubiousSwain [CDS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: i would like to make Chris a proper Mage Of Blood</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think we need less donjon-centric subplots</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: but im not very good at it, so i cant</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Here's a subplot</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Rob</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: protoman showdown</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: so i dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: look in your heart you know it to be true</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we need to make the memo something other than an awful pit of shipping and nonsense</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......SHIPPING.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......ugh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......that sounds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: my schedule is weird and i cant go to many donjons</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......tedious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2b0057">CURRENT wayfaringEnder [CWE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b0057">CWE: I've got some plots with WE but I need permission from the other people plannin' it to talk about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......ask PW about some.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so the rp has been /awful/ lately</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't think CP ever had a "plot thread", other than the Fahr Caverns dungeon series... and even then it's contained to his land...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: from my perspective</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: yeah thats pretty much DS's only char development</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: shipping</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......maybe if we developed teams again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......or something along those lines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: There /is/ one minor thread I'm working on though, I've mentioned the festival on LoSaE</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: momentum is a thing, but ash is still working on its next event</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b0057">CWE: The problem is that there is no real main plot drivin' us right now and people are runnin' out of ideas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Probably hold a mini-event , a casual thing leading into a kidn of bonus dungeon to concisely wrap up RS' land and some more development for him</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: is DS still in momentum?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah, in all seriousness where should i take the amy thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b0057">CWE: That and people are shyin' away from player conflict</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......, why cant we have more chronos events?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You should let her grow up and go to college</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's the subplot</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also im doing the hopefully-nightmarish halloween donjon so if anybody has any ideas for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: the challenges of your daughter growing up</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but college isnt really a thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......that sounds boring though NV and who wants drama?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......its like high school .</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: &gt;its like high school</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: &gt;college</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......high school drama?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SL, no idea halloween-donjon-wise, but as soon as powerdirector stops being a MOTHERBARKING PAIN IN THE ASS and I can start uploading simthemepark halloween episodes, you could look for something there maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......its just so catty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: alrighty</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe she has to figure out what her trade is going to be? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b0057">CWE: I'm just waitin' on FL's enevitable meltdown where he goes full crazy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also request schedule-wise: I know it won't be on halloween itself for irl things, but could it also NOT be on the 25th? got a halloween party then too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ooh, that could work sj</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......i did like the villian idea though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......a group of them would be better .</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also noted cp, i want as many people in on it as possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......players who are fed up with the bs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nightmares for everyone!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: in all seriousness, im doing by-room trigger warnings for people to go on autopilot if needed</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: note the casual horror i keep making happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like my giger parasite gun</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......can we decide on an idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: or everything with that one battleship donjon</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im going to /try/</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......like, make a suggestion list for everyone to look at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: seriously though sj, thats what im going to do once this whole puberty thing is resolved</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, if there's a suggestion pad, people can also say on there which things they're triggered by so you know /in advance/ who to triggerwarn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: good idea yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......triggered by?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also do half-triggers that scare you but dont like send you into a panic attack</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: things that yuo/your char is really really really afraid of ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so ill know what to /try to do/</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well those should be separate</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: "things my character is afraid of that you should target" and "things /i/ am afraid of that you should warn"</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......im afraid of shark bears with chainsaw arms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm afraid of shitty dungeons</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i already have stuff made for fear of thunderstorms, needles, bees...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I'm afraid of obvious gross-out horror that isn't really</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......is it just me, or do you guy swant more people to just start dying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you know... I honestly can't think of any irl triggers I have...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......like in dungeons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's just you</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......okay fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (the thunderstorm one is /awesome/ and i cant wait for it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: same here cp</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......spider... for real.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......bugs in general.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i have some triggers for when i encounter them irl but not when its in text</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b0057">CWE: should have somethin' on WE's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: alright pw, ill tag those</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also: get ready to miss half the donjon</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: :p</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......what?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i have a lot of bug stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......greeeaaat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0000c1">CURRENT matrixAssassin [CMA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: iirc his consorts are spiders.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: whoops</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......we.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: basically if you want to know what my atmosphere is look up hieronymous bosch</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the halloween donjon is gonna be in one of his paintings basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......on a side note, i wish we could have someone who would draw scenes from some of the dungeons we do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I can </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: sort of sprite pretty well and COOOULD use the practice with the tablet but</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: take that chance</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah im also running toh part 2 saturday</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: unless something else comes up</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: any other subplot pitches?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Protoman showdown</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's a mostly joking subplot with fighting involved.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we need good memo subplots</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And it's not joking at all it's actually pretty serious</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like i say, i dont do donjons most</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: *much</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......i was gonna have a dungeon where someone dies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00006c">CPW: ......and it was gonna be multiple ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so i would like a memo-focused subplot that doesnt /suck/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: NV goes villainy tier because everybody in the memo is an awful person, kind of already working the angle as a possibility</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: for example not breeding the genesis frog because none of the people left of the human race deserve a second chance</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i can see that</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ash has the frogs though right</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: or am i misreading that</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Has the /any space player is capable of breeding a genesis frog frog</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: amy can easily become an anti-villain for a subplot, keep in mind</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: grow out of it</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Growing out of it is fine</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno, seems like you're playing her fine to me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, can I at least get a list of all the canon-breaking screw-ups I've ran into? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't really think you've done any kind of canon screw ups you've actually been a really good Time player, I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: only</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: As a /Prince/ that seems wrong, just from my viewpoint.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CP, on the other hand, I've probably actually been playing him (and Kutone) /too human/ actually... CP is half-wolf and Kutone's full-doge, they should be acting more doge-like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Truthfully ICly and OOCly I'm kind of against the idea of Time as a shackle of things that /must/ be done, alternate timelines and such, when my interpretation is more having the timeline naturally attuned to your actions and such.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's not been bad having all the predestination but it feels kinda off compared to, say, Dave, who had a ton of timeloops that just fit naturally with exactly what he wanted to do. I don't know if you've seen the Ultimate Riddle as explained by BKEW but, basically that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. if I remember the explanation for Dave correctly, as he went along his instincts became more aligned with the alpha timeline, so it wasn't that he HAD to do things, it was that what came naturally to him was what was supposed to happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And getting away from that being a Prince means a total departure for norms I think. I mentioned my interpretation of Prince of Time as, possibly, one who destroys inevitability, so if anything I felt like someone with that title should be about /breaking/ inevitability more then anything, looking at something that supposedly has to go a certain way and being able to go "No. Fuck that."</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: &gt; Chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Of course that's horribly OP but then, so are God Tiers. And its just my own personal take so not going that route works perfectly</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: &gt; paradox armor</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: &gt; fuck him</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah /pretty/ much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. that's true actually. SJ's been destroying /with/ inevitability, when she's equally capable of destroying inevitability itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: wait paradox armor that still never stopped being stupid like. FI having it because he was past him I can buy but /him/ having it doesn't really make sense, at least to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And that works too Kim</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and on a side note, I think the "blank timenote warps in when a retcon happens" is a pretty funny gag)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: God tiers and titles are a lot more overpowered and full of ability than a lot of people give them credit for.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if you guys want to know about the blank note thing, it's supposed to be a recipt that something was changed in a doomed timeline to allow the alpha to continue, though because they're doomed, they mostly happen behind the scenes and almost always off-screen. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ being a Prince is fun~ Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: huh... neat!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: CA shoosh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: NV was supposed to be a Prince of Space so I ended up doing all of his character development like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 's neat SJ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: then when Witch came around I was like "well that fits i guess"</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Being an Heir is fun~</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably the biggest thing I need to figure out is, what does "manipulation of luck/knowledge" /actually barking mean/ beyond "literal manipulation of physical Light, and subconsciously being OP at Mario Party"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  [Standing intensifies] --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the one with the furby fur attatched was the one where CC accidentally mistook an area memo for a memo-style memo, so the furbies between the wall were released ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I like Voiding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like Spacing because I realized today there is so much you can do with it outside of teleporting and changing sizes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft is that where the furby one came from? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like I never even imagined how OP that aspect is until today</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wherein NV unconciously achieves the Munchkin tiers</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: FL welcomes him with a scotch and crumpets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The JoJo tiers have been reached</span><br />
 <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Oh dear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like Munchkin tiers would be doing all this without realizing how ridiculously OP it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Hah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh man maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: JoJo tiers are embracing that shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Embracing it and stepping to the next level</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: But yeah, all the apsects are crazy in what they can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ kinda wish I had been a Prince of Space instead of a Prince of Mind Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ which funny enough I got legit Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ instead of just rolling with what I had done previously XD Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also something I've been thinking about lately: due to Brush Abilities (both Okami-canon and v2-custom), CP is fucking around with aspects he has no business touching technically. Galestorm (Breath), Veil of Mist (Time, though it's more of a mental-only effect), Brush Portals (Space teleportation)... and with items, he also pokes Void (Boo's Sheet)...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so he's basically almost the same Munchkin Tier as FL is, except a /lot/ saner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Artifacts are totally game I'd say, I mean Gamzee can used the timeboxes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, having a potion for nearly any occasion ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: use* whoops</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which I don't really like personally, since it cheapens a lot of things ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And I'm still mulling over making it canon that RS alchemized the Flame Regalia with a piece of MP's sword so that psuedo time stuff isn't so psuedo anymore</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: hahahahahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, that I just justify with off-camera alchemy experimentation :P and OOCly, it boils down to "health potions with oddly specific names".</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I thought head GM said you couldn't use out-of-Aspect artifacts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then those rewards from jovin's dungeon are out the window</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean those ball things? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and for the things I listed there, it's not like they're /explicitly/ tapping those aspects, they're just doing things similar to the respective Aspecty Things...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, forgot those ball things were even a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: since I joined so late because I went to the slumberparty instead (which ended up flopping iirc)</span><br />
