<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So /technically/ there is one Muses of Space and Time. But if the session is say, super invalid, then you could have some things going wary.</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: carry on :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: There shouldn't be a Lord or Muse in a session of these scales because people seriously fuck up what they are capable of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Like. We don't know what a good quarter or third of the normal classes properly do and we know even less of Lords and Muses.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE:  <a href='@_'>@_</a>@</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe its like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Lord commands his aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And a Muse inspires her aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: That's the super short version.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Muse asks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And what generally is taken out of interpretation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A lord basically says "do it or I'm gonna rip you a new one."</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ^u^</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: A muse is more like an extrapolating force, observing and disecting their aspect for the good of others [thats the big thing]. And a Lord takes their aspect and bends it for the sole purpose of furthering their own goals. Like when Caliborn was faced with the question of dying for everyone elses sake or continuing on for his own power he chose power cause thats the nature of a Lord.</span><br />
