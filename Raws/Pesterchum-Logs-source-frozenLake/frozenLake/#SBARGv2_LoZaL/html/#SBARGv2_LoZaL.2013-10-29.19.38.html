[08:19:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  turns to face PO. --</span><br />
[08:19:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How is "Spiral Power" a valid source of energy?</span><br />
[08:19:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What do you want?</span><br />
[08:19:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AG, basically Rule of Cool can violate the laws of physics.</span><br />
[08:19:37] <span style="color:#c86420">CPO: Gambit, talk to me later.</span><br />
[08:19:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I have lost all faith in this session.</span><br />
[08:19:51] <span style="color:#c86420">CPO: What do I want?</span><br />
[08:20:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: â€¦ *very wide eyes and confused face, but definitely trying to figure out how to get in the Batwing, because holy shit this looks cool what does it look like inside*</span><br />

[08:21:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT perfectionistOriginator <span style="color:#c86420">[CPO]</span>  the batwing has a pilot and passenger seat, as well as a variety of buttons on the dash, there are various seats with cupholders and other nifty things in the back. --</span><br />
[08:21:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:22:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What floor is the exit.</span><br />
[08:22:15] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When I wanted to get it started... I focused on about the most tangible thing I could. That way I get when I'm in a fight, and losing means dying, plain and simple. That sense that this could be my last...But no, I won't let it be.</span><br />
[08:22:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *slips into the pilot seat and looks for a key!*</span><br />
[08:22:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The will to carry on, and from there, whatever I need to make it.</span><br />
[08:22:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would like to know before you two create a giant drill that /tears the fabric of the universe apart/</span><br />

[08:23:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I guess what I'm trying to get at is...Well you can bandy around this stuff about Spiral Energy and willpower but at the end of the day what's that really /mean/?</span><br />
[08:24:18] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For me it's knowing what I want and knowing I'll do whatever it takes to achieve it.</span><br />
[08:24:25] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's why I ask, what do you want Mike?</span><br />
[08:24:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...dammit I wanna go home.</span><br />
[08:24:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I don't fall asleep in /another/ basement.</span><br />
[08:24:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like on the grand scale of things, or heck, little scale works too. </span><br />
