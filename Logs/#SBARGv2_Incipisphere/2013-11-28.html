[01:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh right, one of the lands, can't remember which one, has Electric Eel Consorts... then again, I doubt they are immune to electricity.</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: Are we auctually having a serious conversation here about what Daleks would do in the Incipisphere</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "EXTERMINATE"</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: Because I could just pop into the timeline where I did do it and find out</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "ELEVATE"</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PK no</span><br />
[01:18] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If it has blood, it can be electricuted.</span><br />

[01:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am upset that Normal Moves are not super effective against /anything/.</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, thats the thing about normal types</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#d5d500">CAE: Isn't thAt impliEd by thE word 'normAl'?</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... they're Normal-type, it's in the name.</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Lots of moves that range, but are not super effective against anything</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, some normal type moves are incredibly powerful.</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like Extreme Speed or Hyper Beam.</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or Explosion.</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or even Judgemen- oh wait thats a multitype move</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#d5d500">CAE: ExtrEmE SpEEd wAs onE of my fAvoritE fucking movEs.</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#d5d500">CAE: I dunno why.</span><br />
[01:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Extreme Speed fucking sucked when your team was built around crazy fast Glass Cannons.</span><br />
[01:24] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: aww</span><br />
[01:24] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: I was kinda enjoying the Dalek talk</span><br />

[01:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right that's what it was</span><br />
[01:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets do a match or something</span><br />
[01:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think I could do a quick one...</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...crap. it won't let me initiate the battle because of my team config. FL, you have to initiate the challenge.</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me make a team...</span><br />
[01:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or just play Custom Game.</span><br />
[01:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh, didn't realize you didn't have one yet. well, I have to leave in 15 so... idk))</span><br />
[01:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You can init or accept anyfin with that setting.</span><br />
[01:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's... not on the list for battle format...</span><br />
[01:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … yes it is? When you personally challenge another trainer?</span><br />
[01:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: where's that button again? the UI keeps getting messed with</span><br />
[01:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((er, actually, we're leaving shortly, too late for me to start a battle now))</span><br />
[01:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( have fun yo. EAT PIE ))</span><br />
[01:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One pokemon down, 5 to go...</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is it possible to mega evolve my pokemon in this?</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or do I have to select the Mega Form manually?</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and I found out why it won't let me look for a battle. all the pokemon on my team are from earlier gens, and you can't uptrade to XY yet apparently))</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause I have the mega stone equiped.</span><br />
[01:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Just set format to none. ))</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((there /is/ no "none" format option on here))</span><br />
[01:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Is in the team creation. ))</span><br />
[01:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((the team IS set to "Format: (none)"))</span><br />
[01:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'm talking about the format thing above "look for a battle", /that's/ what's rejecting my team))</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( Pokebank OU ))</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( You want that setting. ))</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah it's pawssible to mega evolve, I think it happens in-battle.</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: Yeah it does</span><br />
[01:51] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: Guys</span><br />

[01:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...hm?</span><br />
[01:52] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: what if we used a Megaevolution stone on something thats not a pokemon</span><br />
[01:52] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: would it still turn into an advanced form</span><br />
[01:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably the same result as a non-pokemon eating a Rare Candy: projectile vomiting missingnos</span><br />
[01:53] <span style="color:#380054">CPK: hahahahaha</span><br />

[01:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if we alchemized Mega Stones for pokemon?</span><br />
[01:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, a custom megastone for... nevermind</span><br />
[01:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we shouldn't make pokemon period</span><br />
[01:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why did we even start talking about that.</span><br />

[02:20] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...what the heck would that even look like?</span><br />
[02:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With an ability that negates all super effective (and not every effective) moves against it, having all attacks to it deal normal damage.</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, true neutrality.</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that makes Judgement super effective against everything.</span><br />
[02:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause megaforms should be /even more OP/</span><br />
