<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey guys ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2d8a18">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hi...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If they have a sort of technology, then they should know how it works and how to make more/improve on it- Heya SJ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so lets just</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: send out radio waves with the blue prints for the alchemiter</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: are you really gonna do this</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: can we not just leave sentient life alone</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just really don't know how to handle it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: then stop acting like you do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: while some stuff has advantages, they also have so many ways it could go wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: heres what we do with the ability of alchemy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we put it in a box</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we lock the box</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we hide the box</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we do not mention the box to any new life that may develop</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; Consorts talk about the box behind our backs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; It becomes a legend thats passed down through the generations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: let it pass into myth</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: as long as we do not reveal the box</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; Some asshole breaks the box open</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: how about this then</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we make our own legends about the box</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: tell them that it contains a great demon that cannot be controlled</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: greed</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...credit where its due</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: actually, I think a better approch would be to make it sound really lame and not worth opening. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that really works</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course, then someone snaps and opens it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because they want to destroy everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CEQ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yet also make it a bad thing that is lame</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like that one "two bears forever" fake chain letter</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We say Sonic 06 is inside of the box.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they don't know what sonic 06 is. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait no, because then /I/ would open it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: "IF YOU DO NOT COPY THIS TEXT TO 8 &amp; 1/2 PEOPLE THERE WILL BE 2 BEARS EVERY TIME U OPEN A DOOR FOREVER!!!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: something like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if you open the box you will be cursed to a life of mild inconvenience</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 8 and 1/2 a person?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: alternately</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shit, let me appearify my legs again</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ceca54">CURRENT fortuitousSleuth [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: that sound<span style="color:#730e8f">s disgusting</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And Naaah that sort of stuff never works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we destroy the fucking alchemiter</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: can you do that fl</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: can you take the ring to mordor</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: "Don't do this thing" equates to "I should totally do this thing."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, you make it sound like there is only one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: how many are there</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is there a mordor on this planet? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and that I have keep track of all of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: alright everybody surrender your alchemiters</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont have any because im not a fucking madman</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: didn't even bring one. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Alchemiters are a cool and useful technology, I don't care what you say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyone know who sent that spaceship into deepspace?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ????? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but are they worth the danger</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It kinda looked like a big rig to be honest</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well /fuck/</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: imagine what happens if the new cavemen get ahold of alchemiters</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...how about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we all take one last alchemy binge</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: use up whatever grist we have left</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: then we destroy the alchemiters forever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt; whatever grist we have left</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Artifact items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you can keep your shitty grist</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a80000">CURRENT fromAshes [CFA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Guyys how about yyou make something useful with all that grist /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ like medicen and food /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...thats a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CBB</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Until we can find a stable source of the stuff on the main planet /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But the technology- ... Well, at least let me figure out how that stuff actually works! Being able to alchemise something is not just a liberty I wish to destory forever- That's a good idea actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: actually can i ask what i think the central question is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT BRINGING ALCHEMITERS THROUGH THE DOOR WAS A GOOD IDEA</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Someone who wanted a reminder of Sburb /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Too bad theres no Grist anyywhere /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why would you ever want that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gold grist and Artifact grist can be made from nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Because its a cool sort of technology!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: due to paint and jpeg items</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: jesus christ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: alright how about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we find a barren moon and put the alchemy stuff there</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: by the time anyone develops space travel theyd probably be ready for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think a major problem is that noone wants to give up alchemy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i never said that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets just keep it to this star system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we put it somewhere uninhabited and inhospitable to life</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm fine with that. That was basically my plan already: Keep the tech usable, but away from the life-forms. They'll figure it out eventually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and we go there with our immortality and use it when we need it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#b5b500">CURRENT atomicEagle [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: I like how we're setting up an entire fucking universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: I never thought we'd actually do it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets just put it in the deepest ocean</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: space &gt; oceans for keeping things out of reach</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as back on earth, humans had gone to space before exploring all of earths oceans</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but not to /deep/ space</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not with anything alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we put it somewhere far away from here see</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not to mention, people will ask less questions when they see their gods going into the sky and coming back with new shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: then going into the ocean</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: since flight is a power that we have and they do not</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: while theyll probably be able to swim, even if not as well as we do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but can they take the pressure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if we go into the sky</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: they will assume it is some other world or something out of their reach</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if we go into the sea</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: they will try to follow</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: do you understand</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, lets make a space station away from any stars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: now were talking</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats actually better than my idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, people notice spacestations if they are near planets</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and explorers would want to go to planets</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not the middle of nowhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: see now youre thinking</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can use Phoenix Transfer to warp to any person or place that I have spent a long amount of time with/at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and the lunar whale can autopilot to known coordinates</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: relative coordinates, even</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: keep in mind that it was originally designed to get from the world of ff4 to either of its two moons at any time, all of which are in motion</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: does anyone else have a problem with this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, does anyone even know what's even happening over there? I can't even tell really. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: over where</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... good question really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm just hugging an alot and im not sure about the rest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are going to make a space station in the middle of nowhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, pick 3 stars</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: any 3 stars</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and we will put in spack dab in the middle</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((can our consort characters take our v2 characters on as patrons or whatever?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((ooh, that might be cool.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Um, there is no way we could do that with the overseer system... but they could play a role like the trolls in homestuck, as advisors. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((I like the sound of it.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I'll do a Gecko Consort. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((oh, I thought you meant like, they have astrological signs based off of our v2 characters for RP lore purposes))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( actually, I could do a Bee Consort ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((Hm... are owl consorts allowed? I remember RI had them, when she was still a part of this.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((like my spider consort is a follower of The Father, who breathed life into the world and lived among his creations))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, for the longest time, some dude on my land was siphoning my time powers or something like that. Eventually though, he kicked the timebox thing into high-gear and timewarped me to that guy's current time, which was pretty close to the beginning of the session. Of course, because he was using all my time powers for his things, I had to hang back for a while, which actually was kinda useful because there were a bunch of sidequests I forgot about on LoHaN before I had to defeat my denizen seemingly too early. So after doing a ton of sidequests while simultaniously hiding from my past-self, I finally found that guy's hideout, which you guys helped me bust through.  ➜</span><br />
