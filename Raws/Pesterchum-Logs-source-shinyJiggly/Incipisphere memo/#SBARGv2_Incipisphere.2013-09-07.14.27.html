<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: It's just me asking a few questions. Nothing much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I am sorry .-.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What for? It's a meeting. We had 'em the past... well, two weeks before last, last had that other matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But meetings are fuuun and Raz needs to hold his weekly one /staaares/ at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But hey don't be sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah, this is it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: idk I'm enthusiastic about everything in general right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Alright then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: and goody.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm actually vaguely proud that it caught on and you're going without my direct prompting. Or at least hoping that's what's happening here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Kinda</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I thought it being on Saturday was because you couldn't hold it earlier 'cause we're fucking insane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: That was basically it, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … eh. It's still the most exciting thing to have happened /all week/.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: They are supposed to be deciding if they want option A or B, but I'm betting they are just faffing about right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … but this is how we decide things!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: First, we fuck around doing nothing and being snarkily incompetent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh wait. I forgot we never actually manage to decide things 'cause we don't get past that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Neeever mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Hey, we decide a lot of stuff!</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Option A would mean you helping us against /anyfin/, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I'm not afraid of making enemies... so basically, yes. Almost anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Almost?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I refuse to attack consorts, and no loophole with "dur dur dur help us with finding out your secrets, Athena!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The question was more directed along the lines of "dualtiered final boss".</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That loophole would simply be /dumb/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ... heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well... considering how much trouble that thing is, and that he also spells danger for me and my land...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I wouldnt be fully against helping, in whatever way I can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: But thats only if you choose option A, mind you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What you talking bout?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FF, get your ass to the Bacafe and I'll fill you in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I am...uninformed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I gave you players a choice. I do reccomend heading to the HQ to get caught up fully.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh yeah you too I guess BB.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And /don't/ bring your Denizens.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't bring it anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hmph. Dae and Hel showing up were... unexpected, to say the least.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I got nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>I think thats afirst for you, Gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hell no. I got nothing /all/ the time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It is aaall miiine &gt;:333</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: :-) </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Athena, have you heard about the tale of Pandora's Box?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, of course. 'Tis a classic legend.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It sure says alot about human curiosity, doesn't it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The gods give this woman a box, and tell her not to look inside</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, /of course/ she is going to look inside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … FL I think we all know how the story goes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, this is also related to the event of Prometheus stealing fire, knowledge, in this case, from the gods, and giving it to humanity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed. The classic old plot point of "'Don't do the thing' 'Well now I have to do the thing.'" </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Interesting how you would /also/ pose that as option a.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: It's not rare for people to put their personal favored option ahead of the other, player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yet, it is also rather interesting that Hannah goes missing /right before/ this meeting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would you agree with me on that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hm... Indeed. Good eye, there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To be fair, I'm not sure if I can trust you. However, that is not my decision to make.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It seems that the majority has been leaning torward option a.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Its a group decision, kid. You all are supposed to choose between one or the other, together. That being said, I know you all are just doing something stupid instead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like what, AH?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: What do you mean, "Like what?" I have heard on multiple occassions that stupidity is something I can expect often here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>Sadly True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And as I feel any further questions may be leading into option b, I will have to sadly avoid further contact with you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: oh my, what interesting things have i missed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: 'Depends on the question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: i'm quite curious as to these options that were apparently presented in my absense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: *absence</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: It can be narrowed down to A: I will help but leave me alone. or B: Bother me all you want, but I wont be friendly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, but see, how would I know what question would be the wrong one? After all, our beliefs might be as simple as a difference in usage between operating systems, either closed or open source.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can respect the wishes of the rest of this session, but It shall be a challenge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Don't worry about questions, player. I don't attack a person because they asked a simple question; that would go against most of my beleifs. I just won't answer a question I deem unfit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I like her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Understood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: this seems like the perfect time to get some popcorn and sit back to watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: 'tell me about it. I don't  have much to do, besides mess with my players stuff, at the moment. I'm just waiting to be called down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Shall we have closed information, but a guide, or an open source platform that has /no support what so ever/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Uh… FL, we're discussing it in the Bacafe sometimes, stop being a pretentious fucktard in-memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I had to go in the library since you are undressing Kat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We're not. Apparently her clothes aren't plants so Raz says not to go anime-tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have nooo idea what's going on here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Um.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yes Athena, "um" is a proper reaction to this insanity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, we are all mad, aren't we? Even if just a little?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: so I can resume the connection to over there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yeaaah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If you don't stop being a pretentious fucktard, I'm going to stab you in the face.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And perhaps this insanity is what drives us to seek what we should not find.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a sudden urge to hide in a corner somewhere.</span><br />
