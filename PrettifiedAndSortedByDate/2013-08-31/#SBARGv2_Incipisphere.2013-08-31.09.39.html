<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm a Page of Time now, but yeah, I've always at least partially acknowledged the aliens' existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because hey, puppies are very convincing, and both Crux and Kutone hear them fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: I was unaware they could even hear them, to be honest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … oh my god I can't hear the aliens anymore.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((ono))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ SCODE was essentially the same as this. Only everything didn't take forever to happen. GM influence was... Weak. And we made up a ton of shit. But it was just a much more timely version of SBARGv2. ]]</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((Indeed...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: [[ Kinda? But I mean. FA was causing shit. You were causing shit. You both died. Shit died down? So it kinda was a good and proper solution. ]]</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( No, make it a bar... and the bar is off the Bar. ))</span><br />
