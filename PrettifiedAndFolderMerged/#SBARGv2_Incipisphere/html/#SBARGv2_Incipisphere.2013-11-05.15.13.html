[09:03:15] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Okay...</span><br />
[09:03:22] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Anyone know what that fight was about?</span><br />
[09:04:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was supposed to be like, some sorta business meeting regarding the heart of the land ➜</span><br />
[09:04:30] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Wasn't that dying?</span><br />
[09:04:56] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I mean, it would make sense that might be causing the quakes, but I don't know.</span><br />
[09:05:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, and FL was trying to get it back and put it back where it belonged. He succeeded, but at the cost of hundreds of consort's jobs. ➜</span><br />
[09:05:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: massive unemployment ➜</span><br />
[09:06:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: DJ, LoSaCrossroads is dying /now/ because FL permadied. the land was dying earlier from the heart being gone.</span><br />
[09:06:11] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Alright...</span><br />
[09:06:37] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: FL had been going on about the fight being "too easy".</span><br />
[09:07:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that makes sense, considering how few hits it took. ➜</span><br />
[09:07:24] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: What did the heart look like?</span><br />
[09:07:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, Kim, do you remember? ➜</span><br />
[09:08:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...nope.</span><br />

[09:10:00] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Like, small flame, or miniature sun?</span><br />

[09:11:26] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Alright...</span><br />
[09:11:34] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think that's like, his favorite move or something ➜</span><br />

[09:13:09] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: alright...</span><br />
[09:13:28] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm sorta thinking that it might not be FL's lands heart at the center of his land right now.</span><br />
[09:13:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ????? ➜</span><br />
[09:14:03] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ProtoTech weapons, the consort said something about the lands heart promising land...</span><br />

[09:15:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you saying that the denizen's heart instead? ➜</span><br />
[09:15:23] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Yes, /exactly/.</span><br />
[09:15:47] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Prometheus made his death easy so he could take over the land with his soul.</span><br />

[09:16:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that figures.</span><br />

[09:16:59] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We don't need to do anything.</span><br />
[09:17:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's a dead and dying Land.</span><br />

[09:23:00] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I only played Dream Drop Distance.</span><br />

[09:24:41] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Chances are that those players aren't even godtier.</span><br />

[09:25:21] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm willing to bet this is more of a Seer at Chimera Point plan.</span><br />
[09:25:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I thought his name /was/ Xehanort, and he anagrammed "Ansem".</span><br />

[09:25:38] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
[09:25:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Xehanort's plan was to corrupt/possess/fragment himself such that 13 itterations of him were eventually running around</span><br />

[09:26:23] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Unless he has more than just one backup plan.</span><br />
[09:26:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Raz, can you fuck up a Land's heart?</span><br />
[09:27:27] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How so, exactly?</span><br />
[09:27:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably</span><br />
[09:28:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I dunno, but if the Denizen's heart got somehow shoved into the Land, if you could fuck it up that'd be one less thing to worry about.</span><br />
[09:28:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh yeah I could probably get rid of that</span><br />
[09:28:40] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah that'd be cool</span><br />
[09:29:06] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: There still lies the matter of /getting/ to it.</span><br />
[09:29:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How hard could that be</span><br />

[09:30:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: anyway yeah how hard can it be</span><br />
[09:30:21] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'm betting there is a large barrier of plotineum.</span><br />
[09:30:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: plotineum? ➜</span><br />
[09:31:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plotshitium you mean?</span><br />
[09:31:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait a minute, wasn't there like, a hole blown to get there a while back? ➜</span><br />
[09:31:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the crater DT made?</span><br />
[09:32:06] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: what crater?</span><br />
[09:32:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that one place that's pretty much a nice park or whatever now ➜</span><br />
[09:32:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: LoSaCrossroads has a pretty big crater near the south pole. it's actually a pretty decent picnic spot.</span><br />
[09:32:55] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Oh... I don't see a hole there.</span><br />
[09:33:03] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I think it might have gotten patched up.</span><br />
[09:33:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: time player waving like a noodle in the background ➜</span><br />
[09:33:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it got grassed over when he restored the land's heart... or /thought/ he did, anyway.</span><br />
[09:33:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: so there's nothing we can do about this</span><br />
[09:33:58] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: But the fact of the matter, is if we are to destroy it, we need to get someone who can't exactly phase through walls down there.</span><br />
[09:34:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay. So we /go down there/.</span><br />
[09:34:16] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Well, the consorts are bringing the bodies /somewhere/, right?</span><br />
[09:34:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Raz, are you a Captchaloguable entity?</span><br />

[09:36:36] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: yeah, and what happens if your void powers give out while under a kilometer of solid rock?</span><br />
[09:37:13] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: We aren't going to be losing /another/ player, thats for sure!</span><br />
[09:39:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … they don't have a tendency to do that, now that I've tiered, and anti-Aspect fields theoretically exist but I also tend to have a split second to back away before I phase in if intangible... but I haven't actually heard any better solutions from you, so.</span><br />
[09:39:43] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: augh</span><br />
[09:39:55] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: We use FL's corpse as bait and tail the consorts</span><br />
[09:40:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... have you encountered stuff that is solid to you /even when Voided out/?</span><br />
[09:40:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Only aforementioned anti-Aspect stuff.</span><br />

[09:41:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … btw why do we care?</span><br />

[09:42:51] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Depends on how close he follows the rules of the game.</span><br />
[09:43:37] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: If everyone had /good/ little denizens, they would only speak to their players and never leave their lairs.</span><br />
[09:43:51] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: However, It seems that isn't exactly the case.</span><br />
[09:44:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: w/e</span><br />
[09:44:41] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Does a denizen stop existing after the player passes?</span><br />
[09:44:44] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: No, it does not.</span><br />
[09:45:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: no but the deadland Denizens have been keeping to themselves and not bothering us</span><br />
[09:45:25] <span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: After all, mine didn't exactly slow down with his matrix ripoff.</span><br />
