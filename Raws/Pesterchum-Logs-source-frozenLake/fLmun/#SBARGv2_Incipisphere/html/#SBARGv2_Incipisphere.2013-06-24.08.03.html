<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe that the point stuff is because after warp 9, it enters Log scale.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (though, even though I haven't watched Star Trek in a while... wouldn't it just make more sense for the warp scale to be 2^x, where X is the warp number with a start point of Warp 1 = exactly light speed?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: NO</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Warp one is not light spee</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: no ists not</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: w is the amount of warp engines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and x is the warp factor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, no matter HOW MANY warp engines you have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If x is 1, It will always be at the speed of light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I do realize this means war.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: in a nexgen episode I forget the neme wasly is aslked the question how long a ship would take to get some where travaling at  exactly the speed of light it was a trick question</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: star ships canot travle exactly the speed of light thats imposible</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, an equivelent to the speed of light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: because one warp one is faster</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, it isn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and 2 the ship is moving space around it</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: the ship is standing still</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: as it warps space around it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, it still "moves" at the speed of light.</span><br />
