[11:07:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Better than stunting my own personal growth.</span><br />

[11:08:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know, look at some other people we know.</span><br />

[11:09:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's not /growth/. You say you "accept responsibility" but guess what? You don't /learn/ anything from it, you just /whine/.</span><br />

[11:10:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fine then.</span><br />
[11:10:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Always complaining about how you're not a hero, how you're weak, what the fuck /ever/ it all runs together after a while and I never gave a fuck in the first place anyway. Why don't you grow?</span><br />

[11:12:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right there I didn't care about protecting anyone...</span><br />
[11:12:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right then, I just wanted to strike him /down/.</span><br />
[11:12:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wanted him to /suffer/</span><br />

[11:18:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't know how it works, but hey.</span><br />
[11:18:55] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Aspects are funny things sometimes.</span><br />
[11:20:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You /are/ afraid of that, aren't you. And you believe that "absolute power corrupts absolutely" spiel.</span><br />
[11:21:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Just look at Chronos.</span><br />

[11:22:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No...</span><br />
[11:22:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I fear that if anyone could become like him... its me.</span><br />

[11:23:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: A monster, I mean.</span><br />
[11:23:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You have remorse, you have guilt, you have what appears to be a crippling inferiority complex. But also-- and /fuck/ if I know why-- you have friends.</span><br />
[11:23:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Chronos never had those things.</span><br />

[11:25:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Did I say that, you suicidal fucktard?</span><br />
[11:25:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why do you think I told Seth that he won that long time ago?</span><br />
[11:25:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I dunno. Wasn't paying attention to you. Generally don't.</span><br />
[11:27:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Feel free to enlighten me.</span><br />
[11:27:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I want to give everyone a chance.</span><br />

[11:28:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And he made you… so he won.</span><br />
[11:28:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No/</span><br />
[11:29:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I thought maybe if I said I lost that battle... he might take it as me being nice to him.</span><br />
[11:30:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But it just added to his belief that he was all powerul.</span><br />
[11:30:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: powerful*</span><br />
[11:31:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, uh, feeding megalovaniacs' egos either gets them to treat you better or reinforces their delusions.</span><br />
[11:31:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … y'know, fyi.</span><br />
[11:31:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DT says you can't be nice to everyone...</span><br />
[11:31:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: DT is right.</span><br />
[11:31:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, one has to eventually take sides, and that makes enemies.</span><br />
[11:32:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: One has to take sides, yeah, but… *her grin is slight and sharp*</span><br />
[11:32:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's possible to play /all/ sides-- and play them against each other-- for a very, very long time.</span><br />
[11:33:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I am not a manipulator...</span><br />
[11:33:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And if you do it right, even when you strike one down, it'll still think it's got you in its pocket. Up until the moment it's destroyed-- oh yeah okay.</span><br />
[11:33:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: See, I just found your problem.</span><br />
[11:33:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I couldn't get you to help on that puzzle, and I just pissed you off.</span><br />
[11:33:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You've gotta have hella good ranks in manipulation to do shit like that, otherwise you make enemies fast.</span><br />
[11:33:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … yeah, uh.</span><br />
[11:34:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm no Witch.</span><br />
[11:34:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You're a /really/ shitty manipulator and I recommend that if we ever take the diplomacy route to anything, you don't get to talk.</span><br />
[11:35:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT is a better manipulator than me.</span><br />
[11:35:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, he knew that I would panic about him making Revelation 4.13 and him taking it into the jamming field...</span><br />
[11:36:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He knew that I would have to come in person...</span><br />
[11:36:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I question if I really wanted to kill him... what he would have done to me.</span><br />
[11:37:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He was able to make my body move with sound...</span><br />
[11:38:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT is, I suppose, my shadow.</span><br />
[11:39:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

[11:40:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[11:41:55] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You're not gonna be a monster, Kan.</span><br />
[11:42:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: stop calling me that</span><br />
[11:42:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Stop acting like it's what you're going to be and I will.</span><br />
[11:42:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Stop telling me that's who you might be, and I'll stop calling you that.</span><br />
[11:44:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:46:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've been called a sociopathic fuck and worse. And even still, people believe in me. Someone told me it's the choices you make going forward that determine who you are… no matter who you have been, what… what you've done in the past. People are willing to hug me even after I've quite literally stabbed them through the back.</span><br />
[11:46:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … And I don't want to disappoint them.</span><br />
[11:46:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:46:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Those few people who don't believe I'm a monster… I don't want them to be disappointed in me for becoming one.</span><br />
[11:46:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this is why we NEED a session wide feelings jam!</span><br />
[11:47:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nah.</span><br />
[11:47:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That wouldn't help in the least.</span><br />
[11:47:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Some things you'll say one on one that you'd never say around people.</span><br />
[11:47:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Some people you hate. Some people you don't trust in the /least/.</span><br />
[11:47:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Some people would take those secrets said and use them against you.</span><br />
[11:49:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah.</span><br />
[11:49:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: All a Session-wide feelings jam would do is make everything worse-- trust me.</span><br />
[11:49:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Maybe everyone needs someone they /can/ talk to, though.</span><br />
[11:50:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:50:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seth never had anyone... you were right about that.</span><br />

[11:50:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sometimes just having /one/ person who believes in you is the difference between shooting someone in the face with a scythe and putting that scythe back in your Sylladex and walking away.</span><br />

[11:58:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's different for everyone.</span><br />
[11:59:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Was it when he killed my dreamself?</span><br />
[11:59:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … He made his choice before that.</span><br />

[12:08:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 'Sup.</span><br />
[12:08:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: His other choice was death... but to be the savior of the session.</span><br />
[12:08:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah.</span><br />
[12:08:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Putting the others before himself.</span><br />

[12:09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, Mr. Brown... he ran away from his session.</span><br />
[12:09:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He left the others to die when living himself...</span><br />
