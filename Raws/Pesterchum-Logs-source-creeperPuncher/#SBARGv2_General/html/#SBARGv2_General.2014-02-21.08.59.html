<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because the chip companys send thugs to stop the open source battle chips, but they can't do anything /legally/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus due to the nature, you can't get rid of one set, becuase then two more copies of the source would go up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course the open source chips arent as good as the ones you buy... but then there are people that edit the source then keep some of the mods to themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ending up in having to face navis as a group that spam /program advances/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hey Kim</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like if you get the chips early on, they will end up being shitty codes with shitty damage.  So like... An ElectricSword chip with a Y code that deals 40 damage.  then there is efforts to adjust the code so its a better chip code, so it ends up as a "*" chip. While at the same time the damage is being increased. opnsrde1. of course the max damage ends up being 160 with a * chip or something. opnsrdeg * in </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">this example. (alphanumeric to symbolize the damage it does.)  (and the e is the element, electric in this case)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I hate crossposting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, leaving in half an hour probably</span><br />
