[07:12:11] <span style="color:#c6b608">NL: annoying is more of my strong suit. but yeah: who forced you off the wrong side of the bed today? crows as a species?</span><br />
[07:17:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: getting mauled and pecked by animals doesn't help a day start out.</span><br />
[07:17:54] <span style="color:#c6b608">NL: oh hey you finally speak</span><br />
[07:18:17] <span style="color:#c6b608">NL: and dude i should think you know not to take your bitchyness out on other people</span><br />
[07:18:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It was all part of my plan.</span><br />
[07:18:52] <span style="color:#c6b608">NL: you literally had no reason to do any of that- wait what</span><br />
[07:19:10] <span style="color:#c6b608">NL: how does pissing off your resident space player count as a plan</span><br />
