[07:10:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh, oh, I know!</span><br />
[07:11:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lord English VS Gurren Lagann.</span><br />

[07:12:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I swear the fight needs to upscale to the point that Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann gets involved.</span><br />
[07:12:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, seriously.</span><br />
[07:13:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: First the battle gets to the point where the earth gets destroyed and the Arc Gurren manages to escape.</span><br />
[07:13:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then, after English tries to go after that, Gurren Lagann combines with that.</span><br />
[07:14:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then more explosions.</span><br />
[07:14:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THEN GURREN COMBINES WITH THE MOON</span><br />
[07:15:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the battle just continues to upscale from there.</span><br />
[07:15:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it keeps going on from there.</span><br />
[07:15:54] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...what?...</span><br />
[07:16:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to picture a fight between Lord English and Gurren Lagann.</span><br />
[07:16:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it is AMAZING.</span><br />
[07:17:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then the climax takes place in orbit around the <span style="color:#00ed4f">Green Mother Barking Sun</span> and the loser falls into it Mario Galaxy style, right?</span><br />
[07:18:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
[07:18:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: English throws the sun at Tengen Toppa and it converts it into spiral energy.</span><br />
[07:19:09] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Just trying to think of the consequences of that makes my head hurt...</span><br />
[07:20:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 52.8 BILLION Lightyears tall.</span><br />

[07:21:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it'd make the dreambubblesplosion cracks look like grains of sand on a beach, with all the damage the resulting blast would do...</span><br />

[07:22:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still, it looks like it would be the greatest death battle.</span><br />
[07:23:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then the multiverse gets destroyed.</span><br />
[07:23:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it gets remade.</span><br />
[07:23:50] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...No, that sounds more like Stairway...</span><br />
[07:24:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, after STTGL pulls out the giga drill... its length is multiplied by 10.</span><br />
[07:24:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember the quote?</span><br />
[07:24:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT CREATES THE HEAVENS!"</span><br />
[07:26:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but it has to end with lagann impact.</span><br />
[07:26:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously.</span><br />
