<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait he had nature in oracle of seasons.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: yeah, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...pffft</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: LTTP Link is Light...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Oracle games Link is Life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, no, Skyward Sword Link should be Light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: LTTP Link must alone face Ganon, so he could be doom...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And TP could be Void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: What about MM, or do we count that as the same as OOT?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I don't know how we could really do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we counted them as four.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: LTTP was in the oracle games, so he is life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But however, orignal link from the NES games was in Links Awakening...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And he ended the world in that.</span><br />
