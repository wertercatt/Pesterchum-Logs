<span style="color:#969619">CEU: how much weight does one give to actions and outcomes where</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: the outcome is largely beneficial, but the methods for doing so are suspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: more of what is the weigh of ones actions on others. sometimes in the stories the hero isn't even making things better for the majority they are doing what they believe is best\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: When one slashes and burns down sections of the Amazon to power their growing economy, and uses metatemporal physics and dark matter to grow them back in a matter of weeks...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: does one castigate them for their recklessness and enviromental disdain?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Or reward them for bringing in more income through trade of oil and lumber?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: does one do WHAT to WHO now?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00defe">CMG: I lost my quirk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "castigate"</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Uh..ah...sorry about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Tried to find a suitable example from the lore I had up, that was the first example that came to mind as a question of "actions versus outcomes" ethics</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And you know...castigate</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: also there is the point of the power that is being produced by those actions. more power mean cheaper energy and cheaper energy means more money for the common people. so the common people whould support actions that produce more usable energy that would fuel the job market\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: indeed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But, eh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Okay from a different angle as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: but if hero was to strike down this person in charge he would be seem as a tyrant to the people who supported the actions of the other man in charge\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I've got this own base running script going for my own actions and interactions during SBARGv2</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's like planning a game RPG session</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: alright\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I have a rough list of stuff my character would be likely to do if he existed in a void</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and then I work off all the RP stuff that happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and adjust from there on the fly</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Changing the list as things change and shit happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: alright\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But yeah, questions of morality and ethics on a group-based level are always fun, especially when it comes to ideologies</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I must admit, I've always wanted to see a game where part of the gameplay is sliding through different schizo-tech versions of the same setting/city and having adventures and stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Like there'd be a steampunk version of the city in the late 19th century/early beginnings, then switching to a dieselpunk version mid-WW2, then an atompunk one in the early 70s and a cyberpunk version in the far future of the late 90s</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: that could be interesting\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I would read it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And seeing how the city and people and attitudes and visuals shift and evolve/devolve over time</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yeah though i don't think I could write it i seem to be drawn to magic\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: What kind of magic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: alsorts. I've had elementals spirits, mana based techno aypcolise where magic was caused be genetic experiments, and now the one I'm working on currently where magic is fueled by emotion\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ah, good to see. A good assortment</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yeah but the future one also had the main character whose grandfather was a exiperimental soldier who in battle became beast like\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I might go back to it some day\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I've trended towards eldritch/occult magic in a kind of 'power means sacrifice' way in the past for the most part, as well as widespread reality manipulation in the "you face off against reality and insist yours is the true one, and for the time being it doesn't call your bluff" kind of way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Had one fun set of notes and ideas based on twisting the usual 'life magic' stuff though</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: cool i haven't really tried that yet though the current story has a power cuppurts sort of fell to it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Currupts\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: interesting\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: though I think the best defining moment of having a power is when you see the character not use it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it's not just what you do with the power you have it's also what you won't or can't do\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Eu what do you think?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Aside from the usual defintions and trimming of what it does, that is part dependent also on character personality themself. Figuring out what they would(n't) or could(n't) do in the situations you find themselves in, and how other characters interactions affects their own, and then how the specific power works and affect those interactions in it's own right</span><br />
