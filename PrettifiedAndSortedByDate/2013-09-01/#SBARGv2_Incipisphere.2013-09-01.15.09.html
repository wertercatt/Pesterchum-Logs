<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm. I would have thought that creatures farther from humans would have been harder to communicate... the more you know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think speaking animal-language is partially having the right kind of vocal cords to pull off the sounds, partially putting yourself in that species' mindset, and mostly thinking of it as equivalent to speaking a foreign language.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what is this</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dialects I'm not sure about, but I get the feeling it's intrinsic knowledge for Animal Tiers in general to be able to speak the language of what animal they are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Awwww yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: You probably talk to spiders, SL.</span><br />
