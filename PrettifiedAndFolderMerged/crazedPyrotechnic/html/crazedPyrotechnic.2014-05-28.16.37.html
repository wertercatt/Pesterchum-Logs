[16:46:52] <span style="color:#225604">CP: let me guess, it has to do with that dumb game title you were given</span><br />

[16:54:40] <span style="color:#225604">CP: Or are you going to be like the rest of your game-playing peers, and succumb to your supposed 'fate'?</span><br />
[16:54:47] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Isaac, have you ever been to a universe where a book detailing it listed as fiction existed in yet another universe?</span><br />
[16:55:08] <span style="color:#225604">CP: see, look, now you're gettin' it</span><br />
[17:03:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: ...Could you answer the question?</span><br />
[17:05:08] <span style="color:#225604">CP: absolutely</span><br />
[17:05:57] <span style="color:#225604">CP: I've been in places considered fictional by some. Hell, you're probably considered the same by some.</span><br />

[17:06:16] <span style="color:#225604">CP: The same, I believe, is true of every-- oh alright.</span><br />
[17:06:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Now, imagine you yourself wrote the fiction of the world you visited</span><br />

[17:09:13] <span style="color:#225604">CP: What was it, you mean?</span><br />
[17:13:10] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: I mean, imagine going to a universe you wrote as fiction without any of the knowledge you have now about the multiverse</span><br />
[17:13:48] <span style="color:#225604">CP: so what you're saying is you made me or some shit?</span><br />

[17:14:23] <span style="color:#225604">CP: is it worse</span><br />
[17:15:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Its more like... well, it wasn't conventional fiction, it was a roleplay done over the internet... I had my own character, but you were the character of another person...</span><br />
[17:15:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Well actually I had multiple characters</span><br />

[17:23:56] <span style="color:#225604">CP: god, I hated oasis</span><br />
[17:24:14] <span style="color:#225604">CP: i should have just let dad slaughter those jerks. but nooo, i had to succumb to the little bit of humanity left in me</span><br />
