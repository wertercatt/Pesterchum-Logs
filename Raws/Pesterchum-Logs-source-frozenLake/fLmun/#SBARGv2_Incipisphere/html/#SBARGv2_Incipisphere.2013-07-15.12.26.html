[04:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus I think even repeats would work on Bakagami.</span><br />
[04:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I just HOPE this memo doesn't MIND me taking up all this SPACE with all of these BLOODy puns that are making me waste my BREATH.</span><br />

[04:54] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: and I have τo geτ a replacemenτ</span><br />

[05:00] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hey, calm down Kat...</span><br />
[05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Sad thing is...</span><br />
[05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is no plan you could make.</span><br />
[05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other than run like hell</span><br />
[05:01] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah, there isn't much in the way of planning whenever /he's/ involved...</span><br />
[05:01] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...You just have to...be ready...</span><br />
[05:01] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I guess...</span><br />
[05:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Grab sprite. Run like hell.</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Escape into the Magicant</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The… Magicant?</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its actually part of this session.</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's that?</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...The what?...</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its basically a warp zone.</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right, thanks for remining me. FL, later on you need to show me where one of the Magicant entrances is.</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Wait. Is it the one where all the hidden rooms are?</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know the place, but its dangerous.</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah Gambit</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /I love that place/!</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You might be best at finding them</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I will proτecτ Elsey wiτh my life +___+</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … finding 'em? The entrances are super obvious.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I know where a couple are, anyway.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that the walls turn shadows completely black.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I can't portal directly into it since Brush Portals, like Space Abilities, depend on session coordinates that the Magicant lacks. but I can warp to the entrance and get in from there.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#000000">CBC: ☐If you guys don't mind, I'll say no to that tea party.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Huh. They're so obviously not walls.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only entrance I know about really is in the tunnel leading to my denizen.</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'll help you, TT...</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And then the maze sort of thing inside… yeah, I love it there.</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been wanting to find an entrance to the magicant for a while</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Are they super rare or something?</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: you don'τ have τo, I mean τhis could τurn dangerous</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I'm not surprised you can see them AG. the article about them says Void Players and Space Players are great at sensing entrances...</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: TT, I'm coming, if you'll let me anyway :3 Tea partyyy.</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, yes. In this session, HELL NO.</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Oh, really?</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Huh.</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...It'll be less dangerous if there are others to help in case things go sour...</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Plus. /Tea party/.</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say you find an entrance on LoIaR.</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we have Ash help teleport to it if things go wrong.</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You need to show her where it is though.</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I know there's one on LOGAE...</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And there's actually one /in space/.</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is one in the tunnel leading to my denizen...</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I know I'm coming. because activating the Brush Pad is basically a mental timestop, my portal-drawing ability is basically the closest-to-instantanious warp command anyone has...</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I cannot resist tea parties...</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: only question is whether or not I react fast enough when it comes to that... and I'm not saying "if" it comes to, I'm saying WHEN.</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...da, na na na, na na na katamari damacy...</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh shit that was a consort</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...It'd help if I can get a handle of my Aspect beforehand...</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...better help the guy out.</span><br />
[05:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WAIT WHAT ARE YOU DOING</span><br />
[05:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has lost connection --</span><br />
