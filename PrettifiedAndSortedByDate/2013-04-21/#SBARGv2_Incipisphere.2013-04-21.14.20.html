<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its twice as strong as one of my first swords right now... so upgrading it should double it again?</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah basically it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Dark Souls one is easy just repeatedly find a hill about 2 feet tall and jump on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: wow. first time I've seen an item with a fluctuating grist cost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: gold dust, or at least the kind compatible with okami-originated weapons, costs however much gold grist is worth 10,000 boondollars at the time of creation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Interesting</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What could I possibly have to add to the conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I literally just walked around smacking imps with a telescope for like 4 hours </span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Yeah that's what I thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And these guys are making katanas out of gold</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Replace "smacking imps with a piece of crap" with "gathering a bunch of seals" and you have my day</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: yeah i uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: last time i check gold is an /awful/ thing to make weapons out of</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: but okay game</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One Septillion Zillium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ONE SEPTILION ZILLIUM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yikes!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What the fuck sburb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: at least it's not a Zillion Zillium like the zilly-class weapons...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, those only take one zillium... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the infamous Trickster Suckers are -1 Zillium; Warhammer of Zillyhoo and the others are each a Zillion</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, Zillion is not a real number.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: then again, numbers that HIGH are prone to good old Integer Overflow, so for all I know they're effectively one zillium each</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still, the amount of Zillium to make a Mega Radd Sword...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like the game knows.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why are you gathering seals?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How much of a game breaker that would be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I gathered frogs and tied them together to make frog armour but it didn't do anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: holy shit you sadistic bastard</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Or are you just stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Both?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Little bit from column A, little bit from column B</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Living kittens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It was actually really comfortable</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: NV: that's actually more like alchemizing a shirt that says "DERSE AGENTS: STAB HERE"</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Pffft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Derse agents, that's cute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If we ever need to jump off a cliff I know what I'm wearing</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, I doubt gamebreakingness is a factor in cost. the celestial katana has a built-in timestop power when I activate Brush mode, and it only cost about 50 kilogrist iirc...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Celestial...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Okami stuff, huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You have never read kid radd, have you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: nope.avi</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, in Kid Radds orignal game, the mega radd can charge up to 255, the largest word size on the 8-bit console.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: nuhuh.mp4</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's pretty gppd</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, due to the way its coded, it doesn't max at 255 specifically... it maxes at the highest word size.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, on a 16bit console, it would be 65535.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And on a 24bit console, it would be 16777215.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, what do you think the bittage of paradox space is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: 413-bit lol :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Pffffthahahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so that would be (2^413)-1 as a max damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let that run though your heads for a little bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ran through my head and right out</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Basically, shoddy programing and the fragile state of reality = ATTACK DO BIG BOOM</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((FUCK, I just heard thunder))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Great, did the future of this session manage to spawn a doomed timeline that wipes out EVERYUNIVERSE because someone charged too long? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Also, Many Worlds. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So yeah. A fuckton of damage.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((ok, so I'm trying to think of something else art-ways for my v2journalog... what's the main difference design-ways between a normal character sprite and a talksprite? besides having arms))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Level of detail }</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Less colors. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { The fact that a talksprite is a drawing of a person while a sprite is a minimalist stylized representation }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Like the difference between a Mario sprite and a Mario render for like SSBB }</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((man, the rain pile doesn't keep from falling more... I hope I don't lose power))</span><br />
