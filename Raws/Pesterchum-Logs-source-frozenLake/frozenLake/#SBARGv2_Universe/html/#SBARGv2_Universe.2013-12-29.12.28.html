[10:35:53] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, they /don't/ have one for antimatter? ➜</span><br />

[10:36:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm kinda shocked they dont have one for antimatter huh</span><br />
[10:36:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, they do have one for kinetic weaponry.</span><br />

[10:39:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically big boom.</span><br />
[10:40:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, don't impulse engines travel at 0.5c</span><br />
[10:40:25] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: they can go faster but theres safe gards</span><br />
[10:40:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay...</span><br />
[10:40:34] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: to prevent relitivity</span><br />
[10:40:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats actually wise.</span><br />
[10:40:56] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: and I beleve full impulse is around .5 c yes</span><br />
[10:41:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And how much force can the shields take?</span><br />
[10:41:42] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: I dont beleve that was actualy mentioned in the show</span><br />
[10:41:55] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: define force?</span><br />
[10:41:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, how much power is used in maintaining the shields.</span><br />
[10:42:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as the energy of a shield would be constantly used going outwards... it is likely the shields would drop during warp.</span><br />
[10:42:44] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: If warp power is down they arent as strong.</span><br />
[10:42:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, there we go.</span><br />
[10:43:04] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: but they can be up at warp.</span><br />
[10:43:41] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: I cant describe how it works because scince hasnt caught up yet.</span><br />
[10:43:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The shields are hooked into the power supply of the ship, and when the warp engine is going on, that energy is lessened, causing shields not to be as strong.</span><br />
[10:43:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, science /has/ caught up!</span><br />
[10:44:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember those plasma orbs in your house?</span><br />
[10:44:37] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: no If warp power is down shield power is redused because Axuilury Generators cant produse near as mutch power.</span><br />
[10:44:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the ones that react to your touch?</span><br />
[10:44:46] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: yes</span><br />
[10:45:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats prove that energy shielding is possible</span><br />
[10:45:28] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: The matter antimater reaction produses engergy far in ecsess of what is neaded for warp power</span><br />
[10:45:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except the energy required to shield something has to be equal to or greater than the energy released against the shield, and has to maintain that at a constant output. </span><br />
[10:46:03] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: which is why it can oly take so mutch before the generators overload.</span><br />
[10:46:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except it could also be short bursts if the computer can calculate the energy required to block /every object/</span><br />
[10:46:34] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: its not</span><br />
[10:46:51] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Its a bubble or else a transporter could penitrate</span><br />
[10:47:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[10:47:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But see, short bursts would enable more effective shielding if you could get it to work.</span><br />
[10:47:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and lower power would be enough to block a transporter.</span><br />
[10:48:00] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: true</span><br />
[10:48:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But right now, it would take swapping out the onboard systems with quantum computers in order to get the processing speed required.</span><br />
[10:48:44] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: but energy wepans tuned to the correct frequency can go righ through</span><br />
[10:48:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so it just isn't /effective/</span><br />
[10:48:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, true.</span><br />
[10:49:32] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Charlie the ships Duitronic computer systems are top of the line</span><br />
[10:49:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why you constantly change the frequency of the shields when not being shot against.</span><br />
[10:50:02] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: yes but thats not always plausible</span><br />
[10:51:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is alot of things to think about.</span><br />
[10:51:45] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: and that is what the shake down is for</span><br />
[10:51:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: night guys</span><br />
[10:51:55] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: 'nighτ.</span><br />
[10:51:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right, night.</span><br />
