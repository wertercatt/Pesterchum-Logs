<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where did that come from</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just tell me why</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to go through the possible explanations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so basically: space is too scary? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though i can guarantee if you went through with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay I guess maybe since both you and I thought that was it, thats gotta be the case for the theoretical version of me that was planning it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you werent coming along once we rebuilt</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but if I was planning it, it would have been so that I wouldn't have been caught</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fair enough yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, its dark enough already that Unova (which is based on newyork) is host to Victini, the /victory pokemon/.</span><br />
