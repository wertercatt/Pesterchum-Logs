[13:34:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: that's what I figured you were talking about. and go ahead, it's your dreamself, and your land.</span><br />
[13:35:05] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: And my laptop</span><br />
[13:35:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: come to think of it, the Grid is probably harder to Spacey Thing or Timey Thing to/from than the Magicant, so it seems like a good idea.</span><br />
[13:35:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: just make sure you password-protect the FUCK out of the thing.</span><br />
[13:36:03] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: Yeah, but I really dont want to reveal it</span><br />
[13:37:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: I know. just saying if FI stumbles upon your laptop and finds a file called powerkitten_dreamself.user, one rm command and you're boned.</span><br />
[13:38:14] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: Yeah thats why Im going to do something stupid after bringing my dreamself in there</span><br />

[13:38:26] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: Im going to leave my laptop with my dreamself</span><br />
[13:38:33] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: Put it in itself</span><br />
[13:39:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: well... as long as the portal stays open (or better yet, be smarter than Flynn and have it be openable from the inside!!!!!!!!)...</span><br />
[13:39:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: anyway, whatever you want to try to keep Dream You safe, go ahead.</span><br />

[13:40:03] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: Its hard fucking work</span><br />
[13:40:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: yeah, I can imagine...</span><br />
[13:40:43] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: Yep, and the constant virus attacks from in the grid arnt helping either</span><br />
[13:40:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: bluh...</span><br />
[13:41:21] <span style="color:#bc7d00">PK: We should mount another expodition into it</span><br />
