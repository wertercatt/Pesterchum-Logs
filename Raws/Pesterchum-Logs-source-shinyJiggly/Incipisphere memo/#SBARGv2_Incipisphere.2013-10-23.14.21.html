<span style="color:#00027c">CSR: You have three choices. One: go after this crux. Two: fix this spat. Three: whine fo eternity, and get nothing done. Pick one and go do it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You have the Sprite pendant. You have it in your power to call him, and, lets say, apologize for lying. Tell him why you did it. Try and catch up, I mean he's your bud right? Or so you'd have us believe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That won't take more then a few minutes, an hour maybe. Definitely not two days.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: RS, pendants can't force-summon player-prototyped sprites. they can call them to your location I think, but only if the playersprite /wants/ to come.</span><br />
