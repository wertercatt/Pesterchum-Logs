[18:54:43] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi there ➜</span><br />
[18:54:44] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: noooooo</span><br />
[18:54:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: can't be</span><br />
[18:54:58] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: heyo</span><br />
[18:55:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I hope you heard we beat the session</span><br />
[18:55:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, not sure if you were there for that</span><br />
[18:55:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yep. some... couple months ago?</span><br />
[18:55:35] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nah. i had work that night</span><br />
[18:55:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, uh, on the recaps</span><br />
[18:56:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1. Everyone is in the new universe, with no way back to the session. SBURB Game Constucts, such as alchemiters, no longer function.</span><br />
[18:57:00] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably just easier to link to the new infopage ➜</span><br />
[18:57:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2. There is a multitude of threats, ranging from a player from another session called "Cal" that can absorb aspect powers, to the fellow players (mostly FL)</span><br />
[18:57:49] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so i've heard</span><br />
[18:57:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3. The combination of void players and replicators have managed to replace alchemy.</span><br />
[18:58:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since replicators can replicate most things that don't involve magic.</span><br />
[18:59:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or super hitech stuff that basically /is/ magic.</span><br />
[19:00:22] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So. Wait. They /can/ replicate things that to an untrained eye would deem magic or they /can't/?</span><br />
[19:00:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: can't ➜</span><br />
[19:00:42] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kay</span><br />
[19:01:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it rules out golden power nodes and stuff like that, but you can replicate all the sporks you want.</span><br />
[19:02:43] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm out of the loop. Golden power node?</span><br />
[19:03:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also FL has an AU Machine that has a virus, so when people get through a few AUs (my excuse to get SBARGv2 players to play videogames), more fun can be had I guess</span><br />
[19:03:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: those are just fancy plug-in thingies ➜</span><br />
[19:03:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They run on a wormhole to a pocket universe instead of uranium.</span><br />
[19:03:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <a href='http://angersexual.tumblr.com/post/80491643461/roachpatrol-khrispkream-boy-we-weak-as-hell'>http://angersexual.tumblr.com/post/80491643461/roachpatrol-khrispkream-boy-we-weak-as-hell</a> flaming soccer ➜</span><br />
[19:04:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, to recap what happened today to SJ</span><br />
[19:04:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SJ: that's cool FL: that's cool too</span><br />
[19:05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL gave the password to fly the QP to Kimura, and he is now just... getting lost in the woods.</span><br />
[19:05:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />
[19:05:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This was sorta sparked by NV and RS, though FL is being stupid and doing the wrong thing</span><br />
[19:08:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah the AU Machine is my excuse to get the v2 community to play more games</span><br />
[19:08:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and so far it's not really doing much. ➜</span><br />
[19:08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hell, the new overseer session is part of that project, though I'll mix it into the plot too.</span><br />
[19:08:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Somehow.</span><br />
[19:08:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess it can "retroactively" happen</span><br />
[19:09:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With some entities created in the AU to explain Kat and such</span><br />
[19:12:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, unless we bring her back. Maybe with a Green Mushroom or something.</span><br />
[19:12:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (1up)</span><br />
[19:12:27] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: What</span><br />
[19:12:31] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, no ➜</span><br />
[19:12:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah I'm not gonna do it</span><br />
[19:13:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might only restore from KO.</span><br />
[19:13:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if we /did/ get our hands on one.</span><br />
[19:14:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and really all this is doing is giving FL more reason to build soulbots</span><br />
