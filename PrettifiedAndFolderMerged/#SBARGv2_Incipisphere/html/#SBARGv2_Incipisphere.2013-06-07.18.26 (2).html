<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Corrupting our FG he used 'em as a gateway into our universe and our game, triggering a double-title and losing his physical form in exchange for the power to bend both Space and Time to his whims.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: He got in contact with my sessions first guardian, and lead him to the code, having him start a session before the reckoning. Unfortunally for the first guardian, he could not see past our session, and could not tell of what chronos was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Oh, I guess you do understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah, basically what we both went through just now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: His plan was aparently to prototype himself with the power of the green sun.</span><br />
