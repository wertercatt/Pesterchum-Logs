[20:06:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so if you used someone elses computer as an alchemical base, it would be yours when alchemized</span><br />
[20:07:17] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: yes, and their data would be carryed over</span><br />
[20:07:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, the data for /that/ computer would not be carried over</span><br />
[20:07:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the data for /your computers/ would though.</span><br />
[20:07:53] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: What?</span><br />
[20:07:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its kinda complicated</span><br />
[20:08:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and confusing</span><br />
[20:08:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, okay</span><br />
[20:08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: say your friend makes this awesome computer</span><br />
[20:08:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and is like "here have the code"</span><br />
[20:08:43] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: The only way that would work at all would be if as soon as you entered, everything you have on your computers and downloaded onto them later is stored on YOU instead of the computers</span><br />
[20:08:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so you make it, and it-</span><br />
[20:08:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: linked cloud</span><br />
[20:08:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats /exactly/ how it works</span><br />
[20:09:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meaning, the metadata generated for the computer is a playerID/cloudID and nothing more.</span><br />
[20:09:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes</span><br />
[20:10:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Life is very, very fun right now.</span><br />
[20:10:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[20:10:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: metadata can also carry for, say as an example, someone's text color</span><br />
[20:10:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or current modus in usage</span><br />
[20:11:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so, when you alchemize plain cruxite (pointless to do) it takes the color of your text</span><br />
[20:11:27] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: But that doesnt explain why when I use other computers that I havent set up for my quirk dont have it</span><br />
[20:12:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and when you alchemize a captcharoid camera, it carries over the colors of your current fetch modus</span><br />
[20:12:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know how to explain that</span><br />
[20:13:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: try rebooting your computer if you have that issue, and if it keeps it, then its a bug.</span><br />
[20:14:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or someone broke your alchemiter</span><br />
[20:15:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know for a /fact/ that items made with the pocket alchemiters have a forced metadata value of zero</span><br />
[20:15:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so you get stuff like black cruxite, and computers that don't have anything on them other than an OS</span><br />
