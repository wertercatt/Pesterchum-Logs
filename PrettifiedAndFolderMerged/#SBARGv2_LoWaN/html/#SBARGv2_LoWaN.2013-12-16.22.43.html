<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  tries to find the right words. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  leans on the wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (getting kinda weirded out by everything, but fine otherwise)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  nods, downing the shot. "Indeed there is, but whatever's after this will be filled with, /her/, and fuck, she's already screwed me over enough. I don't need to be living out the rest of eternity on her leash." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Her?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: AshEs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: What is between you and Ash?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (Yeah... so am I, to be honest.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "A very short history of her fucking me over in every way possible and not caring enough to stop me from becoming what I have." He pours another shot and downs it. "Of course, she's not my only reason for it, but she's probably what tipped the iceburg." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Would you like to give an example...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (So...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "Lying to me, making me feel like I was worth /something/, then forcing me to watch as she went off with another guy." He sighs, leaning his back against the wall. "Oh, and if you haven't already noticed, I'm pretty much a little bitch about everything. What point is there to life when your emotions make every move made by everyone ever seem ten times worse? Not to say Ash is innocent." He wipes his mouth. "I think even --</span><br />
from a normal point of view, cheating on her boyfriend with me, telling me she'd leave him, then dragging me along until I had the guts to walk away." He laughs. "That's some pretty bad shit."<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  nods slowly and looks to the floor for a moment. "I really have nothing to say to that but... hmm..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: You can't let one person ruin your life. Personally I haven't had any kind of intimate relationship but I've always watched other's from the sidelines...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I've seen some pretty bad stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "I can't die, so it's not like I'm actually going to. Plus with me missing the final boss a heroic death is pretty much impossible. I'll just live out my time alone and hope she never calls." He downs another shot. "That's a shame, I'm sure you're a catch, in a good way." He wipes his mouth again. "I wish I agreed with you, but while I'm sat here with no motivation to get out of that chair and stop wasting ammo on my own head, --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: One of these days you might stop thinking like that... heroic death or just death aside, when death comes to your door, you may not think the same way. Personally I'm terrified of death!</span><br />
