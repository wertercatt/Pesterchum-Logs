[03:45] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 STARTERPLANET.</span><br />
[03:48] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#438d15">CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:48] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  slams the rod down through some of the outlying rocky ground. He has all he needs. --</span><br />
[03:49] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0078f0">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  just continues to sit on the mountain, unaware of what is going on. --</span><br />
[03:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The ground rumbles violently. --</span><br />
[03:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  floats up slightly, wondering what the eff is going on. --</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The lava in the ground coalesces into a single stream, rocketing through (and presumably starting to flood) Charles' mountain base. The energy being fed through the dormant volcano suddenly causes it to spurt out the top, ash everywhere. --</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  mutters something quietly. --</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  looks at the stream... and spots green!CP with the staff. --</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Shark.</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  looks back at the stream. --</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  rips his walking stick out of the rocky ground, walking casually back to the bar, not caring for the destruction he's causing. --</span><br />
[03:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  pauses a little way away from the volcano, turning back and looking up. --</span><br />
[03:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  points menacingly at Charles, making a throat-slitting motion. --</span><br />
[03:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  flies up into the air... and shoots down torwards the base of the mountain. --</span><br />
[03:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  Towards where Greenfield is? --</span><br />
[03:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  starts slashing through the rock... attempting to... cut the mountain off of the ground? --</span><br />
[03:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals into the village having come through the door from Augataur, what the /fuck/ is going on? --</span><br />
[03:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  starts zipping around the mountain, cutting faster and faster. --</span><br />
[03:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  Unbreathable, practically toxic ash is in the surrounding area's air. --</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  seems pretty unfazed, despite his surroundings. --</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  equips fishbowl helmet and flies in the direction of the shenans --</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is ignited ablaze from the heat around him as well as the fires of his own soul. --</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  that's a thing, apparently? --</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  takes a deep breath, sighing. --</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  screams in mental, physical, and emotional pain. --</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also, I missed everything before "-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer [CCP] slams the rod down through some of the outlying rocky ground. He has all he needs. --" because I was playing newleaf and missed the memo (literally), what context am I missing?))</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Damage'll at least last for a few years.</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  pulls out another sword, accelerating even further --</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: (( <a href='http://pastebin.com/icdi2geY'>http://pastebin.com/icdi2geY</a> ))</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((k))</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  sits down, casually meditating in midst of the chaos, the rod perched on his knees. He really could care less, couldn't he? --</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  flies away from the mountain, and slams himself into the side of it. --</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is attempting to... /push/ the mountain. --</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  switches his item loadout from the speed base that he was using to something with a bit more power. --</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  spots FL and flies down --</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: need some help?</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // The mountain is beginning to move... and FL's stats are dropping, except for his mangrit, which is increasing. --</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: GET A SPACE PLAYER!</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Copland transforms into a rocket-powered boxing glove kinda thing, and he starts pushing the mountain with it --</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there haven't been any around here in weeks!</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  mutters something in his trance. --</span><br />
[04:04] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is pushing in the same direction FL is, obviously --</span><br />
[04:04] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Stupid kids and their flashy, useless powers. . .</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...Kimura, run.</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dammit, why couldn't Adeelah have been an Earthbender? I /really/ could've used that about n-- what?</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And if I saved him... take care of Crux.</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is building up energy. --</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh frogs.</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  deploys a LakituCam, attaches the Medigun to it pointed at FL in full-blast Ubercharge mode, and flies out of there himself --</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //your choice as to which type of uber, invuln or crits --</span><br />
[04:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  plows into the mountain, shoving it the rest of the way... before it slows to a stop, far from where the lava was pouring out. --</span><br />
[04:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  ... Good job, numbnuts. There's still lava pouring out of the ground where the volcano was. --</span><br />
[04:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is tumbling down the side of the mountain. --</span><br />
[04:09] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  It coalesces, turning, churning, pumping out at an increasingly fast rate. --</span><br />
[04:09] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  flies back, floating a short distance from the lava --</span><br />
[04:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I take back what I said earlier, Firebending probably /is/ what's needed right now.</span><br />
[04:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  comes to a stop on a flattened tree... alive. --</span><br />
[04:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shifts to human form because the motions kinda require hands, and starts trying to bend the lava away from the village... not even redirect in a specific way, just "you no go toward village" --</span><br />
[04:12] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The lava's presently collecting into some sort of spherical shape, above the ground-- but something seems to tug back at Kimura's attempts. --</span><br />
[04:13] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  supplements the bending with some brush use --</span><br />
[04:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  It's absolutely clear now, that someone with a serious amount of discipline and experience is actively working against Kimura. --</span><br />
[04:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what the fuck is going on here?</span><br />
[04:17] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  is still seen calmly meditating amongst the ashy air. --</span><br />
[04:17] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  goes "fuck magic" and has Copland put up a forcefield between the lava and the village... but still keeps trying the magic thing anyway --</span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((afk gotta check the mail))</span><br />
[04:20] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is too tired to wiggle his left foot, let alone do anything to help the situation --</span><br />
[04:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((back))</span><br />
[04:24] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  ((supposes he's going to have to borrow art for this)) --</span><br />
[04:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  keeps doing the thing, while the lakitucam keeps focusing the medigun on FL --</span><br />
[04:25] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( <a href='http://unofficialmspafans.bandcamp.com/track/john-do-the-windy-thing'>http://unofficialmspafans.bandcamp.com/track/john-do-the-windy-thing</a> ))</span><br />
[04:26] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //listens to that for exactly 4.13 seconds, closes the tab, and puts the Re-Tail jingle on because nope --</span><br />
[04:27] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  is certainly doing something with this mass of magma, isn't he? <a href='http://music.jwmusic.org/track/pour-some-lava-on-me'>http://music.jwmusic.org/track/pour-some-lava-on-me</a> --</span><br />
[04:28] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: ((BRB))</span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The gathered sphere of lava slowly rises into the air. --</span><br />
[04:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is beginning to strain holding the lava back, even with the forcefield doing most of the work --</span><br />
[04:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  wait so it's just kind of surrounding it? --</span><br />
[04:33] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT hopstheFrog [CHF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT hopstheFrog <span style="color:#000000">[CHF]</span>  hops along, a seemingly ordinary frog --</span><br />
[04:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  i thought there was like a wall between the area and the village --</span><br />
[04:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  it's kind of a curved wall thing, sort of /half/-enclosing it on the village side --</span><br />
[04:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  well, i mean, it's more like 4 feet in diameter, at best, so --</span><br />
[04:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ...oh. okay, I was /way/ overestimating the lava blob then --</span><br />
[04:35] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( could you speed this up? I gotta go ))</span><br />
[04:36] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  in that case, the forcefield extends around the entire lava blob :P --</span><br />
[04:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  quietly muses to himself. --</span><br />
[04:37] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: It's not the amount you have, really, it's the force and drive you channel through it, that allow it to become powerful.</span><br />
[04:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...hm?</span><br />
[04:38] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#aa00ff">CURRENT awesomeSwordfish [CAS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:38] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CAS: (lurking))</span><br />
[04:38] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The lava seems to flare out, in a gaseous sense of the word, straining, and possibly disabling-- maybe even outright engulfing the forcefield. --</span><br />
[04:39] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unless the lava can noclip, not happening. the field is airtight --</span><br />
[04:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  The walking stick glows, pumping even yet more energy into the little ball, attempting to surpass the limits of the barrier. --</span><br />
[04:42] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  realizes this isn't gonna work forever, and draws a brushportal to orbit to drop the lava into --</span><br />
[04:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  *orbit on the /other side of Starter, over an ocean/, to clarify --</span><br />
[04:44] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: More weight.</span><br />
[04:45] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  drops the lava ball into the portal --</span><br />
[04:45] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  A sudden and surprising outside force seems to assist the warlock, redoubling the efforts. --</span><br />
[04:46] <span style="color:#aa00ff">CAS: ((what is with all the cp's?))</span><br />
[04:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  looks a bit taken by surprise by this, seeming to recognize the signature, but hopes the shock will break the barrier nonetheless. --</span><br />
[04:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the barrier breaks... on the other side of the portal, dropping the lava into the ocean on the other side of Starter --</span><br />
[04:46] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also the portal closes --</span><br />

[04:48] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  turns to look at gCP --</span><br />
[04:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what was the point of the volcano, anyway?</span><br />
[04:48] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  slowly gets up, leaning on the walking stick, unprotected from the ash. --</span><br />
[04:49] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Ask your cowardly friend. He's to blame.</span><br />
[04:49] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks for FL --</span><br />

[04:51] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Ash will cover the lands for a few months. Your ecosystem, ravaged.</span><br />
[04:51] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: All because you folk decided to bully one of our own.</span><br />
[04:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh great, FL taunted Isaac again didn't he.</span><br />
[04:52] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Truly, I didn't even need to create an elemental to do that. The damage is already done, see?</span><br />
