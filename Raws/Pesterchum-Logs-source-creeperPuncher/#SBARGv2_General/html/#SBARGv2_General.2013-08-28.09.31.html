There is no "life" here.<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: welp anyways, this is the ooc memo for sbargv2, a mostly self insert/fankid RP/slowly updating arg with puzzles and plenty of tumblr shenanigans. This memo is usually a lot different from the IC memos in tone.</span><br />
Sorry.<br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: This memo is iN_NsaN_Nity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: I like it that way. Four NNNNs.</span><br />
the best kind<br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The IC memo is a DRAAAAAAAMA LLAAAAAAMAAAAAA!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It needs to be spayed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: depending on who's in that one and how many of them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then it'll quit having baby llamas.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Some/when/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Yeah, more like that. Your bed bursts into flames one night, there's a small amount of poison in your breakfast, just enough to make the day suck really badly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I live in /afk time/, IM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Killing someone outright wastes their usefulness!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ah, see, I like making it artful. But sometimes toys are just /too/ broken to put back together, and as such, killing them can make them even more useful-- a message, perhaps, or something else entirely-- than they were alive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Yeah, I can see your point. It really comes down to the situatioN! There's no catch-all for violent conducT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Exactly! ^-^</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Are you guys talking about murder? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: If you will, can you please murder peacefully? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Not outright murdeR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Of coursE! Unless a messy, painful, loud death is requireD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Then I'm sorry no, the point is for it to be non-peacefuL. :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: However, murder is /great/ at reducing violence!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Corpses are /remarkably/ nonviolent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, while NN is online, her parents have spyware that monitors everything in the memo because they don't like some of the things she talks about for some dumb reason. But she won't be appearing online until tomorrow probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Yes, very true, but you have to make sure no one cares if the corpse is not a corpse or noT....</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: and we have an NSFW memo. I'm currently op in it actually. so it's lowercase.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Because then they get violent, then the corpses start stacking uP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, well, see, then you just have /more/ peaceful people, wot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Very truE! But what happens when you've pacified everyonE? Then there's nothing to play witH!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Necromancy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: WuuuuuuurD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Either that, or keeping just a /few/ people alive as toys~</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also: Rock Tunnel can eat Zubat poop and die in a fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm telling you, murder is /totally/ a bonding experience.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: and I'll tell it you said so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: A family that murders together stays together, that's what I've always been told.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: We weren't really family, but we liked to think so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#502e94">FIM: why are you acting like you're serial killers</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Then I'm disappointed :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Because why murder the weak? :&gt;</span><br />
