[16:43:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: stupid best friends that you revive then they go crazy, blow up the top of your mountain, then try to MURDER YOU for dark gods which I know is a bullshit excuse</span><br />
[16:44:55] <span style="color:#225604">CP: Is this a bad time?</span><br />
[16:45:05] <span style="color:#225604">CP: I mean. I can gloat maniacally later if this is a bad time.</span><br />
[16:45:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: I haven't drank my booze yet today, alright?</span><br />
[16:46:04] <span style="color:#225604">CP: so THAT'S how you stay so chipper</span><br />

[16:46:38] <span style="color:#225604">CP: i don't get it</span><br />
[16:46:52] <span style="color:#225604">CP: let me guess, it has to do with that dumb game title you were given</span><br />
[16:47:04] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Well, not /mine/... but yeah</span><br />
[16:51:27] <span style="color:#225604">CP: well golly gee whiz are you just going to sit there and mope for the last few trillion years of your life</span><br />
[16:51:42] <span style="color:#225604">CP: like i mean gloating's no fun if you're already in the dumps</span><br />
[16:51:58] <span style="color:#225604">CP: i mean, look, buddy</span><br />
[16:52:56] <span style="color:#225604">CP: a few years back life shit on me pretty hard. i took it out on people around me. from what I gather, you somehow saw that.</span><br />
[16:53:10] <span style="color:#225604">CP: I got knocked down. But I got up again.</span><br />
[16:54:05] <span style="color:#225604">CP: Now, lemme ask you buddy, are you tough enough to do that yourself?</span><br />
[16:54:40] <span style="color:#225604">CP: Or are you going to be like the rest of your game-playing peers, and succumb to your supposed 'fate'?</span><br />
[16:54:47] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Isaac, have you ever been to a universe where a book detailing it listed as fiction existed in yet another universe?</span><br />
[16:55:08] <span style="color:#225604">CP: see, look, now you're gettin' it</span><br />
[17:03:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: ...Could you answer the question?</span><br />
[17:05:08] <span style="color:#225604">CP: absolutely</span><br />
[17:05:57] <span style="color:#225604">CP: I've been in places considered fictional by some. Hell, you're probably considered the same by some.</span><br />
[17:06:08] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Alright, alright.</span><br />
[17:06:16] <span style="color:#225604">CP: The same, I believe, is true of every-- oh alright.</span><br />
[17:06:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Now, imagine you yourself wrote the fiction of the world you visited</span><br />
[17:06:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: how would you react to them being real?</span><br />
[17:07:50] <span style="color:#225604">CP: Not surprised at all, really.</span><br />
[17:08:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Alright, as the /first/ universe you visit</span><br />
[17:09:13] <span style="color:#225604">CP: What was it, you mean?</span><br />
[17:13:10] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: I mean, imagine going to a universe you wrote as fiction without any of the knowledge you have now about the multiverse</span><br />
[17:13:48] <span style="color:#225604">CP: so what you're saying is you made me or some shit?</span><br />
[17:13:58] <span style="color:#225604">CP: gross. then you'd know all about the greenfields, I suppose</span><br />
[17:14:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: No, not existly</span><br />
[17:14:12] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: exactly*</span><br />
[17:14:23] <span style="color:#225604">CP: is it worse</span><br />
[17:15:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Its more like... well, it wasn't conventional fiction, it was a roleplay done over the internet... I had my own character, but you were the character of another person...</span><br />
[17:15:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Well actually I had multiple characters</span><br />
[17:15:33] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: but thats besides the point</span><br />
[17:17:04] <span style="color:#225604">CP: so great i'm a fanfiction character</span><br />
[17:17:23] <span style="color:#225604">CP: if you'll excuse me i'm going to have to go puke</span><br />
[17:17:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: at least it wasn't a shitty on- actually, looking back on it, it was</span><br />

[17:19:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Um... old website that kinda has gone through so many changes that the original RP has been pretty much been lost forever</span><br />
[17:20:13] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: I got a link to a site that it kinda moved to... but I haven't joined in as much.</span><br />
[17:21:04] <span style="color:#225604">CP: well golly gee whiz, man, just tell me someone i'd recognize</span><br />

[17:23:09] <span style="color:#225604">CP: never saw it written down</span><br />
[17:23:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Lambda and Oasis were two "halves" of the RP.</span><br />
[17:23:50] <span style="color:#225604">CP: well y'know there's been a few overhauls and it seems the two whining babies are seperated pretty good</span><br />
[17:23:56] <span style="color:#225604">CP: god, I hated oasis</span><br />
[17:24:14] <span style="color:#225604">CP: i should have just let dad slaughter those jerks. but nooo, i had to succumb to the little bit of humanity left in me</span><br />
[17:24:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: but um...</span><br />
[17:24:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: Tarska and Edward Lake</span><br />
