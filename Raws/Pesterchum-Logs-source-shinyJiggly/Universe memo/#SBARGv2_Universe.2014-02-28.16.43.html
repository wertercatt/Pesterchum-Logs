<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and now you flee in terror.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: are you honestly returning to that topic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I am still here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And I'm still waiting for the answer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thief. Or. Rogue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: You won't get your answer</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I do not want to risk it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you were a thief of life, that would cause a great deal of moral issues. That one would likely wish to talk about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Being a murdering asshole, my any moral issues I may have would differ entirely from yours</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Most murderers do not consider themselves assholes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This might imply that you have a great deal of regret, and thus are hard on yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I have no comment</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Further more, the amount of regret would likely only be if you had ended someone close to you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is also known that the activation of a sburb session destroys a persons entire planet. A few of our own feel they are responsible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we did what we did because we knew it was the only way we were going to survive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kill or be killed, or so they say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I do not carry that burden, as I was not the only one to activate said game</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A few hundred.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: You are pretty good at digging for truths, child, I'll give you that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: But my circumstances would hardly be called 'usual'</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A few hundred people did the same thing I did, but that does not absolve me of the guilt I have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, the only reason I haven't snapped from that is because of the existance of an earth in another universe that was untainted by the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Then perhaps you are in need of more help than I</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When I sleep, there is the nightmares.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Those marbles of our subconsious that are it trying to relay a message to us.</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Nice English, numbnuts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While the outside of the marbles have a smooth surface, the interior is cloudy, with us unable to tell what exactly is going on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I bid thee, quit digging the crypts of mine heart. Thou shalt find only rubble and knotted roots</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ...woah....</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What may seem like adorable stuffed animals in the marbles might mean something incredibly terrifying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the general messages tend to stay the same, uncorrupted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the believed betrayal of a friend, for instance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its hard. Its hard, and few understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Child. Enough. </span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: happens to everyone once in a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Would thy ears know the meaning of 'assassin'? Would thy short life know of not knowing, of being created for a purpose that ultimately would rot thine own mind? I dost not imagine so. Now excuse me whilst i clear myself so that i may speak in a sence that you may know</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: the rebuttal</span><br />

<span style="color:#722881">CAS: isaac...what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: both of these two sounds like they're in one of those really long and angsty poems</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: you know the ones, where they recite them at stage with their black clothes and eyeshadow</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually I had to take a break and lost my train of thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: I'd have to agree...mostly for the random passages of shakespeare like english</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: shakespeare? hell no</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: he was just a dude that liked dick jokes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: XD</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: written in a different time period, so it seems "proper" to us but seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: do your research. each of his works had a substantial amount of dick jokes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ok fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: someday</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it's hilarious. he was a hilarious man.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wow, that's actually kinda facinating ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: but the point was...holy shit CC's language change</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Like, you pick up a transcript and read it and you're like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: "He's widely regarded as the best writer of all time. He's talking about penises."</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: XD</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: And then you laugh like a lunatic. It's a real experience.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ok, i guess i'm the only one that finds old english popping up in chat suddenly odd</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably just the dude's quirk or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: he's just one CRAZY AMERICAN GUY</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: 'tis not a quirk per say. The only quirk of it is that I return to it when upset </span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so how old are you kiddo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: You're like "oh, child, enough" all the time. I bet I know at least three people older than you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: give me like a ballpark range here</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Perhaps, but i got used to calling humans child, as they all tend to be younger than I</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: no really, i'll probably name like five humans i know personally that are older than you</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doubt he is a googol</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: A ball park may possibly be 210 or somewhere near there. I've stopped keeping track every year because my 'birthday' isn't particuarily special. No, i'm not incredibly old, I'm actually still adolescent. but still older than humans that tend to live to 100</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh my god you are young</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: okay i'm pretty sure gramps is way older than you</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I'm aware i am young</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and a coward.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I' prety sure I've established this when I first came on</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: where'd the coward thing come in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i dunno, but for some reason he knows my first name</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: he's making vast assumptions</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: Oh..i said it earlier</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: clearly i'm not a part of this group</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: second of all, he used to have an obsession with antimatter a while back. (he's only used it at least twice) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thirdly, he may or may not be addicted to pain and/or dying. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: honestly, it's kinda hard to tell. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: That's somehting I never tried</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.... probably a good idea to stay away from the antimatter. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: oh?</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright then. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: What is that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it can either be read as a tongue sticking out, or wearing a hat. the current usage in this context is pretty much a non-chalant "alright then, shrug". ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Strange</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sometimes it's also used in the context of mischeviousnes/after telling a joke or when you're just plain tired and want to flop over sideways. ➜</span><br />
