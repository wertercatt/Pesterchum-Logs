<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">He is suffering from amnesia, and is becoming obsessed with gravity training...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">I need to keep tabs on his progress before he causes the entire hq to fly into a black hole or he dies from to much g force.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">Damnit, I've lost him.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I'll modify the response of the forcefield sometime later then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Shouldn't be a problem.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">Alright.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">...lets see, maybe I could sneak around easier if I could... scale myself some how.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">...Pretty sure there is an SCP object that does that.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Just don't start alchemising stuff like the book of common diseases or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: <span style="color:#ffd700">Alright, lets make SCP-786...</span></span><br />
