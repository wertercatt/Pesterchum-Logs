<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Hmmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: I don't know, I'm leaning towards Anti-Spiral....but he's Lord English...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see...'</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lord English, in his current vessel, can call upon the power of the <span style="color:#00ff00">Green Sun</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: GREEN SUN</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, The Anti Spiral can throw the might of an entire BIg Bang at his enemy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As well as having the power to create pocket dimentions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Hmmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Still leaning Anti-Spiral</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, Lord English has been known to destroy sections of the afterlife, using the power of the White Wand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Anti-Spiral</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: as in...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: from Gurren Lagann.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Which I built!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Anti-Spiral wins</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: hands down</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has also been stated that Lord English is immortal, other than glitches in timespace.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Dude, holy crap, I forgot my wands had that much power!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, It could just be channeling innate power.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Much like Eridans Wwhite wwands of science.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: I'm gonna try that out later....but continue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And with the mass energy of two universes, thats a massive amount of energy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lord English is also a lord of time, able to bend it to his will.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that might not do much against a being that can violate the speed of light and create energy out of nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nothing other than the rule of cool, of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: I think LE would lose because anything with Spiral in the name pretty much does what it wants.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the main body of the anti spiral is physically weak, able to be killed if you get a direct attack on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, a drill to the face.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the chest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: I was about to say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Anti-Spiral wins, in my opinion </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The largest weapon the antispiral ever created was Super Granzeboma, standing at a height of 52.8 /lightyears/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it can create a drill 10 times its height.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: o-o</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: I swear, I'm finding some robots to combine with...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but Granzeboma isn't a robot, I thought</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Yeah, seems like an insane matchup</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Super Granzeboma is a mass of spiral energy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe it would be a bigger fight than Goku vs Superman.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And maybe win.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Something makes me think we haven't seen all that Lord English can do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7e17">CPO: Yeah, I mean, the dude just might have something up his sleeve yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we need to wait until the giga pause ends...</span><br />
