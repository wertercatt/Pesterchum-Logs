<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...is there any type shape in pokemon other than Fire/Water/Grass?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As that forms a perfect triangle...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: iirc rock/flying/fighting</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: rock beats flying, flying beats fighting, fighting beats rock</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL:  <a href='http://www.dragonflycave.com/typechart.html'>http://www.dragonflycave.com/typechart.html</a> an older version of this thing let you find "type polygons", but its either gone or buried in the menus somewhere now...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... also Psychic&gt;Fighting&gt;Dark</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dark is Immune to Psychic, I wouldn't use that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically trying to shake things up for a pokemon fangame/hack/whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think rock/flying/fighting and sort of psychic/fighting/dark were the only ones in gen 5...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: idk if the gen 6 type chart changed it at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fairy/steel/fighting</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, thats enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: for you but</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just wanna figure out what all of them are</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: for my own purposes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and for future reference</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: grass/bug/rock</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: psychic/ghost/dark</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: think thats it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: my brain hurts too much to continue</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So uh, if you took a bunch of factors into consideration... how powerful would V-Create be in a pokemon lore type basis?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Earthquake only has a power of 100... but V Create has like... 180.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is more powerful than Magnitude 10. (with a power of 150)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So uh... I guess what I'm trying to say is... It could replace an influential weapon in history?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You all are at the bar drinking without me, aren't you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fine, I'll just... DEEP FRY CHOCOLATE COVERED BACON.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, I'm there now... it's just me, EQ, IB, and one of the alien visitors, and all of us are just zoning out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Man, this is /so good/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mmmmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ew</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit FL. at least share some of that &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Chocolate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... /Ew./ Deep fried... chocolate covered... Bacon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ew.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is delicious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Sure doesnt sound delicious</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, it is /very/ delicious. Too bad you are all at the bar not paying attention and missing out, huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I might understand its due to Scion, but FL sure doesn't. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Have fun with your diabetes, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((actually, nothing's really going on in there either right now))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: mmm, so delicious</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((we had our test session yesterday, but not actually doing anything today other than watching reactions to SL's summary post on /tg/...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyway, thoughts before I put V-Create into the plot of my Pokemon Story as basically a nuke?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also FL, as an attempt to convince you to come back, have SL's summary of yesterday's test. <a href='https://boards.4chan.org/tg/res/29586430'>https://boards.4chan.org/tg/res/29586430</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...that just gives me reason /not to/ ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( :( ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL? EQ? Thoughts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not really, to be quite honest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway FL, you better start sharing that bacon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So no objections?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, what bacon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  facepaws --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The metaphysical bacon I made up on the spot to get you to pay attention?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sigh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, I could be lying about that and just have a /ton/ of bacon to myself which I won't share.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But really, would I lie about lying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: lies of omission do in fact exist, no matter how much doc scratch says they do not</span><br />
