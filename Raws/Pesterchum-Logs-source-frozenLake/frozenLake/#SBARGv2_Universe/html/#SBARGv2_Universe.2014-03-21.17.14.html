[19:10:11] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Where is it?</span><br />
[19:10:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No idea why we need to mourn a lizard.</span><br />
[19:10:23] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Hey charles</span><br />
[19:10:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because this lizard was my best friend</span><br />
[19:10:38] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: What happens if I text you pictures of naked people</span><br />
[19:10:46] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Do you explode?</span><br />
[19:10:52] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Can I do it for science?</span><br />
[19:10:59] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Very well. I will continue to monitor this memo</span><br />
[19:11:54] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Speechless?</span><br />
[19:12:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, its already happened, and I did /not/ explode, nor do we need to test again.</span><br />
[19:12:07] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: If you really want to honor your lizard's memory live in its stead, and don't turn into a blubbering mess.</span><br />
[19:12:14] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Can I still try?</span><br />
[19:12:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No VS.</span><br />
[19:12:26] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Somehow you seem the type to lose it over a death, even an animal's death</span><br />

[19:12:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ho-ho-holy shit, shutup already.</span><br />
[19:13:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I don't even know how to live in a lizard's stead, crawl onto a rock and lick the air a couple hundred times?</span><br />
[19:20:50] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: It's what he would have wanted.</span><br />
[19:21:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll do my best</span><br />
[19:21:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually I was following this lizard looking for an entrance to this place I need to get into</span><br />
[19:21:43] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I figured the lizard might have a little cave or something</span><br />
[19:22:16] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: More reason to live like he would.</span><br />
[19:23:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, gotta think like a lizard.</span><br />
[19:23:04] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Is it normal to believe one must replace the being that one has killed?</span><br />
[19:23:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah I'm just method acting.</span><br />
[19:24:17] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I see</span><br />
[19:24:23] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And the lizard fell off a cliff, I didn't kill it.</span><br />
[19:25:23] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I see</span><br />
[19:25:32] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Did you see the body yourself?</span><br />
[19:27:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not really.</span><br />
[19:27:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You sure it fell?</span><br />
[19:27:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might have jumped.</span><br />
[19:27:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm pretty sure it didn't plan for the rock to break under it.</span><br />
[19:27:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And fall into the fume crags.</span><br />
[19:27:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: onto some outcroping</span><br />
[19:28:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh</span><br />
[19:29:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm not sure if the fumes are toxic but I don't particularly want to find out.</span><br />
[19:31:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok wat</span><br />
[19:32:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I walked up to the library, no door. I don't got my fuckin library card.</span><br />
[19:33:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Prayed to Allah for the doors to open, no doors.</span><br />
[19:33:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Find a lizard to find a door, still no door. Sure I could open up a hole inside but where's the fun? No fun.</span><br />
[19:34:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[19:35:40] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Is fun that important?</span><br />
[19:40:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fun is always important.</span><br />
[19:40:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Otherwise you become Charles.</span><br />
[19:41:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but explosions are fun</span><br />
[19:41:45] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Is Charles someone who is it unfortunate to resemble?</span><br />
[19:43:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: In most situations.</span><br />
[19:43:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd hate to resemble anyone really.</span><br />
[19:45:08] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Poor guy couldnt handle a couple images so be blew up my glasses</span><br />
[19:45:13] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: he*</span><br />
[19:45:34] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: bane of fun</span><br />
[19:48:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I said no three times.</span><br />
[19:48:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No means no.</span><br />
[19:49:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Buncha textual rappers.</span><br />
[19:49:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright-y, anybody want to go library exploring.</span><br />
