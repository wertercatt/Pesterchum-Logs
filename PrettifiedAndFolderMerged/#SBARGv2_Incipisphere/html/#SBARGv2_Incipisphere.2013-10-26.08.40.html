<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, what lands have nakadiles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: one was on the memo last night, and invited MH and I to its land...</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: now? :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whenever everyone is available i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (no firefox, KSP Wiki != TF2 Wiki.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm available.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You're available.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: is kim?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm available today as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Puppy /looks/ available.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not gonna go, I doubt I could stealth</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((plus id kinda like to see if i could get more people maybe))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus more people going isn't exactly... a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( I don't think you grasp the concept of a stealth mission ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: charles if you fucked up the stealth youd probably nuke the castle</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((:p))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah. For this sorta thing, keep it a fucking small group.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, i could help if you need a distraction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Seriously, /one/ person is optimal, with someone on backup to rescue 'em if need be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Two, threeish people can still be done, but it's… like exponentially harder o.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well i need to be there since its my land quest</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Yeah... should only 2-3 people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and gambit, youre better at stealth than me so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bingo. Cloak and Dagger code is tf5pyCnD</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Also, don't forget to bring cardboard boxes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF, you are a moron.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well yeah. But all I'm saying is I do stealth shit on a regular basis. And you want a sneaky sneak team, not a "fuck shit up distractionary sneak team".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /everyone/ has played metal gear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FF that's also like the dumbest idea ever? so. invisibility &gt; boxes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, the only place a cardboard box is useful is a storage room.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I got the Spy watch, so I'm ready when you guys are.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: uh, give me a bit to prepare some stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Meet up there and figure out a plan once two of us know what the site looks like? xP</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because like… have you been there before, or nearby?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: death by headbonk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...That... that would never happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ive been a bit inside and i know the general layout</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Yeah, But It DOES have it uses. Like placing a carboard box somewhere, where someone will investigate it should you can sneak pass them or take them out,</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What do you know about its defences? There /are/ things that can see through invisibility. Not to mention that you, unlike me, cannot go through walls or doors or enemies with impunity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its defenses are mostly underlings</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and lots of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the deathly hallow was said to be able to hide from /death/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, forgot to mention, that's one thing the Boo's Sheet /can/ do: intangibility against enemies/enemy attacks. but the puny duration's still an issue... hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, goggles of true seeing can... see through that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Things what can see me while I'm faded + invisibility cloak = things being able to see you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: can they be used together maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: cloak and dagger and boos sheet</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's the Cloak and Dagger?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, you mean CnD for invis and the Sheet for intan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: have cloak and dagger active and use boos sheet when you need it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Gambit, it's a TF2 item.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its an invis watch from TF2.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's on your Land, a'least. Good startyplace. And probably visible. Due to a fuckton of guards swarming that Amy could see.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think the Vrillyhoo counts as hammerKind only since the Zillyhoo is the most obvious component in the result...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though do you think the ancestral awakening indicates she might have picked up bladekind somewhere down the line?</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah, i think its silly to say she never picked up another specibus during the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, barely anyone upgraded their weapons...</span><br />

<span style="color:#7fffbf">CPK: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#7fffbf">CPK: but the more people who know</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which means its 9 times as hard as a normal, one person, stealth mission.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7fffbf">CPK: still adds difficulty</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: have you figured out when it's safe to do it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7fffbf">CPK: auctaully its 14 times harder</span><br />
