<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 HOTEL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( so should we start? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( yeah sure ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  suddenly races through the front door of the hotel, running into the library, and dives behind a bookshelf. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  jumps out of the way of the ballistic Edward, confused as fuck --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is as always when she is awake curled up in the library, white scribbles covering the floor for a bit around her. She glances up from the book she's reading when she hears the crash of an Edward coming in. "… Is it important?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just, on the floor, curled up into a ball. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Edward got Maru Mari! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Edward? I'm /assuming/ that was you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ohgodohmanohgod</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  walks over to him, concerned --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a... are you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He found out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh gog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You're not making any sense; I hope you know that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT copperDragon [CCD]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT copperDragon <span style="color:#000000">[CCD]</span>  // A loud, draconic roar can be heard from outside. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, is that Riyotic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Riyitic, and yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Riyitic, right. Did he come to visit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah visit sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't tell him I'm here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: who is he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT copperDragon <span style="color:#000000">[CCD]</span>  // A loud voice can be heard from seemingly nowhere, and yet, everywhere. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: "Bring Edward out here, and let us settle this."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  climbs to her feet, stowing her stylus in her pocket dimension and placing the book neatly back on the shelf. She doesn't move to clean up the scribblings, only making her way out of the library, through the lobby, and stepping out the front door to see if she can see the dragon. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT temporalTragedy [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  2CREECH --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, he can't fit through the front door, so that is good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT copperDragon <span style="color:#806000">[CCD]</span>  is outside. He spots Alanna, waving slightly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Edward, who /is/ this guy and what does he want with you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Hey, could you hurry up with bringing him out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why do you want Edward? He ran in there all a-panicked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...remember when we all went in the elevator and found that cave system?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh, that guy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Yes, I have discovered that /he/ was the one that blew up the mountain that my cave entrance was on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Was he? Jerk move. Hm… what do you plan to do to him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: I plan to make him pay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Aaany more specifics?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Who was that person he revived?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  nervou5ly float5 to..uhh...wherever --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What person? Oh… that… one guy? EP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ...I believe so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then that guy. EP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I haven't seen him around lately.</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: I used a spell to see into the past. I know it was him that blew it up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … EP, or Edward?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Edward, of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: What, do you honestly think that EP could blow up a mountain?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have no idea. I haven't interacted with him much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So. How do you plan on making Edward pay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Well, I have learned this spell... Baleful Polymorph, was it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, that sounds /fascinating/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: I plan to turn him into the snake he is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  hides further in the library. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: h...hello...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What kind of snake, exactly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: A Tiny Viper, of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Awww! Those are adorable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you plan on keeping him polymorphed forever?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: If he doesn't turn back by himself, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay. *nods to Riyitic* I'll be right back, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Alright then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT copperDragon <span style="color:#806000">[CCD]</span>  begins to wait patiently. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  heads back into the library, withdrawing a card from the deck she wields. "Puppy? Where are you?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Oh, I might need to mention, I put this place in a magical field to prevent him from Teleporting out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is now tucked into one of the empty shelves. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks at Edward again, then walks further into the library, just trying to distance himself from the whole thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: hello? .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  stumbles upon Edward, crouching down at his side. "Hey. I'm pretty sure you heard all that. I can help you, okay?" She holds out the card to him. "Just take this." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this smells like a trap :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  isn't taking the card. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ends up looping back around, running into Edward and Alanna again --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...why is this place such a maze? also hi again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm betting thats binding runes or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Most of my traps involve fire. This is a /library/. Staying in the shelf forever isn't going to help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Riyitic, I'm sure, has far more patience than you do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  eventually find5 the group "...why i5 one of you in a 5helf" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alanna, magic takes energy to maintain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can just outwait him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: "Or you could realize that I have a /listening spell/."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's terribly rude of you. *withdraws her stylus, switching it for the card*</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: WHΘ W▲S TH▲T</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  5pazze5 out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: DΘN'T E▲T ME</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  begins drawing white marks on the floor around Edward's shelf. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: "I would prefer not to damage the building, as it looks rather nice."</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...why can't you guys just talk it out? like, try to fix the cave or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Take, how do I fix an entire mountain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  al5o goe5 and cower5 in a book5helf --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  hums softly to herself as she draws. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blows at the marks, trying to get rid of them. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  Blowing does… absolutely nothing. Why would blowing do something. That's crazy talk. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: mommy ;n;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: I don'τ wanna die..</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stares at the floor marks --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  finishes up the chain of runes around his shelf, setting down a white gem and inscribing the final one on it again as a link. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  extends a hand and rubs at the marks, trying to make them go away. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  lights a fire on his hand and fixes up the marks quickly, redrawing a couple of them out of arm's reach. They're not all reachable from the shelf anyway. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: "...are you torturing him?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws a mini Galestorm to put the hand-fire out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: "I think that might be a /tad/ bit too far, to be honest."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  takes advantage of this distraction to finish up the circle and tap the white gem, getting the white marks to glow faintly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the glow. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ah /shit/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Lock him fast, stay his flight. Cage this man and hold him tight. For his actions, for his crimes, hold him here 'til the end of time!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  kicks off from the shelf. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RUN AWAY</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  runs as well --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  flops onto the floor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  has just created the runic equivalent of a force cage around him. Running away is exactly what it is designed to /prevent/ FL from doing. Welp. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ...Could you bring him out soon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Riyitic, I lit his hand on fire so he would stop interfering with what I was doing. He's fine. Also, caged, at least for a little while. Do summoning circles still work outside?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ...No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Suggestions on how to bring him out instead of forcibly transporting the cage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ...none.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  well, if Edward didn't get out in time (which on my end he /did/), then Take is also stuck because of Gambit's turn-cheating and having been next to him to blow out the hand-fire --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  *Alanna --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  fucking habits --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Theeen would you be able to tie my signature into an exception field in whatever spell you're using to tie off whatever he's doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ........what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: W-whaτ's even..going on..</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  thought Galestorm worked from a while away and was trying to cage him and some area around the shelf, putting things /out/ of arm's reach. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  was still standing next to him like a moron... but that's beside the point --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ...Whats keeping you from just... dragging him out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … the fact that I'm not very strong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And can't pick him up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  CP, the wording of it also makes it so it's holding an entity for actions or crimes, so theoretically if you haven't done anything crimelike you /should/ be able to get out? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of walks out of it then? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, why can /he/ walk out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Presumably because he didn't do anything wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And you're not going to go see Riyitic on your own due to being too much of a coward to be shapechanged into a snake for a while, even though your inability to leave the cage clearly indicates that you deserve it. And he has no idea about spell matrixes. Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but if I can't get turned back, I lose my memories!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't want to forget...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *stares at him for a moment, then writes on the ground* Magic-dispelling effects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *similarly written* Those /are/ things, you know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks around for something to write with. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: ...Do I need to scry as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *aloud* No, I'm trying to figure out how to get him out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#806000">CCD: Then dispell your field and drag him out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I'm /not strong enough/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I /can't/ physically pick him up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And without the binding cage, he can run away.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: we can...τie him up..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … hello, strange person. Do you have rope?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who /doesn't/ carry 50 feet of rope?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I mean...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  reache5 into a plu5h 5he --</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CTT: ((bluh enter key))</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: you c-can never be τ-τoo careful...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If you haven't done anything wrong you can probably get in and out of the cage okay to tie him up. I, uh… kinda can't go into the penitent's cage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: ..w-whaτ do y-you mean by τhaτ..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, despite the fact it's my spell, I wouldn't be able to get back out. Sooo if you wanna rope him, you probably should.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: w-well...o..okay...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a rope. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Fine, use this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: She's holding rope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  winks. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  double the rope double the fu-not even gonna fini5h --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  moves aside so the strange girl can rope him. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT temporalTragedy <span style="color:#000000">[CTT]</span>  promptly trie5 to tie him up --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is easily tied up. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  k so once he's all restrained and stuff she'd break the runes and then probably fall over unconscious or suchlike. [[(( Because the player is being dragged away. ))]] --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  nods... but then facetails again. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is it written in your book?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  gets an idea, and begins to move into what looks like letters... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  retrieves a thick black marking device and dumps it in his cage, along with a sheet of paper. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  begins to pick up the pen... and write horribly. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I figured that. Can you write out how to dispel magic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or I mean I could try unweaving the spell. But. I'm not very good at it. I'm mostly good with cages.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … and if I fucked up it'd probably kill you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  continues writing. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  opens it up, and looks inside. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the paper, and writes a message. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has run out of space on the sheet of paper. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  begins to transcribe "Dispel Magic". --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  watches him in fascination, helpfully adding a second piece of paper to his cage. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  needs to use 3.5 sheets of paper total, using both sides of them. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  settles down comfortably near the cage with the sheets, studying them intently. --</span><br />
