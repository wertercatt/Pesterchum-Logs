<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#555555">CURRENT fluffyInventor [CFI]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  seems satisfied and sits down in the grass --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  walks over and also sits down --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, it seems to be working then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yup. Seems good to go. I'll need a test flight tomorrow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: where do you plan to go from here? or are you gonna stick around for a while longer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  shrugs. "Maybe head back to the lab." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Maybe check out other planets</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  finally walks out of her house, still wearing a hoodie and sweatpants --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  yawns --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  waves from her spot next to the pylons and run way. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there Kim âžœ</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  waves --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I would offer to give you a Closet Door so you could come back and visit without having to go the long way... but what with the whole "keep this planet a secret" thing, that might not be a smart idea for us, since anyone can walk through an open door, and the people at your lab would probably be interested in checking us out...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...yes they would.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  rubs her chin --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still, you're always welcome to return if you want...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I should probably wipe this coordinate off my record though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, it was nice to meet someone else who can change between canine and humanoid form, and I hope to see you around again someday.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: --oh, and remind me to give you a thing before you go, so you can keep in touch via FL's server. it has basically infinite wifi range if you have an appropriately equipped computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I'll keep that in mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  smiles at him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It was nice meeting you too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  nods, and returns to the bar --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  sits under the stars --</span><br />
