[01:44:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah uh</span><br />
[01:44:22] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: well since the universe is infinite</span><br />

[01:44:47] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I dunno...</span><br />
[01:44:54] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: started thinking about the sessions of this game</span><br />
[01:45:03] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and if players could potentially escape a session on meteors</span><br />
[01:45:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay then, invite him to the memo or something))</span><br />
[01:45:38] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I mean, its not really stereotyping</span><br />
[01:45:56] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: eventually there'll be some war mongering race that gets out of their sessin</span><br />
[01:45:59] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: *session</span><br />
[01:45:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's still kinda rude to assume somebody's going to immediately act like that. ➜</span><br />
[01:46:04] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and decides to fuck shit up</span><br />
[01:46:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((or we could just pm, let me finish up to where sl can physically be there</span><br />
[01:46:15] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: well to be fair the universe is infinite</span><br />
[01:46:25] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: and its pretty hard to avoid them immediately acting like that</span><br />
[01:46:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "oh noes, eventually unique groun number 3453 is going to be here, let's treat the next group like we would treat them, even if they're the wrong unique group" ➜</span><br />

[01:47:14] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'm not immediately assuming they'll be bad, even</span><br />

[01:47:23] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'm just saying eventually it'll happen</span><br />

[01:47:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and eventually an invisible teaopt is going to collide with your face. ➜</span><br />
[01:47:45] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: which is pretty hard to avoid, to be perfectly honest</span><br />

[01:55:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. like a Beta Kids type thing, but instead of Scratching and heading into the Ring/Fourth Wall, they took the defense portals back.</span><br />
[01:56:42] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: personally, I might have done that had I thougt of it</span><br />
[01:56:56] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: if only because that came was a hell hole</span><br />
[01:58:22] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I personally would be interested in hearing tales of their adventures through an unwinable session</span><br />
[01:59:43] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: i'd be especially interested in how they came across the idea to hitch a ride on a meteor</span><br />

[02:00:28] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: nothing?</span><br />
[02:00:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: depends on if they were suppose to die or not. ➜</span><br />

[02:00:46] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: I mean, I guess it would be dreadful</span><br />

[02:00:56] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: but apparently anyone can cause the scratch</span><br />
[02:01:15] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... I suppose the session would either continue to go on, or  if they needed to scratch, would end up being doomed.</span><br />
[02:01:26] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: no?</span><br />
[02:01:31] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: didn't john do the scratch?</span><br />
[02:01:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In normal sessions you can't win if a player dies</span><br />

[02:01:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right?</span><br />

[02:02:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its why dave had to go back, hold on, let me get the quote</span><br />
[02:02:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he went back because John died /and couldn't get Jade into the session/.</span><br />
[02:02:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TG: what else is there to know TG: we lost TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch </span><br />
[02:03:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then there was the entire deal with Aradiabots warping in to beat the black kind</span><br />
[02:03:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: king*</span><br />
[02:03:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...well ok, maybe with a smaller group it matters more, especially if there's only one Spacer.</span><br />
[02:03:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 144 player session</span><br />
[02:03:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :P</span><br />
[02:04:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah. If the space player perma-dies before making the frog, then you are in trouble.</span><br />
[02:04:01] <span style="color:#008a8a">CBH: the spacer is needed to win the game</span><br />
[02:04:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, ours was around 100, give or take a baker's dozen. and we had plenty of permadeaths, and still won.</span><br />
[02:04:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[02:04:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: remember when I died twice</span><br />
[02:05:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay it was a bunch more</span><br />
[02:05:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: portal 2 ref failed</span><br />
[02:06:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think the only hard-and-fast requirements are that *Everyone enters *Everyone prototypes, unless it's a Beta/Alpha sitch *At least one Spacer survives long enough to make the Frog *Black King defeated before Skaia is destroyed</span><br />
[02:07:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its funny objects can't be doomed</span><br />
