<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (that actually happened once when doing a livestream exactly one year ago) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: :oo</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...anyway, I want to get Sleeping Dogs during the steam sale, but mom doesn't seem like the type of person who'd be 0kay with "GTA-like" games :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (a playthrough of majora's mask to celebrate the end of the mayan calendar. I accidentally showed a tab on firefox with a planning doc on it) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (wuh-oh)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (...and speaking of firefox can I STOP WITH THE 400-TAB PILE)</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: ::o</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: /400-Tabs?!?/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...the other reason I'm not getting Sleeping Dogs is, I already have my budget for this sale planned out and I'm already $23 over what's in my wallet (I have to drop Starbound to make it fit, also according to lifehacker, games released &lt;6mo ago don't get discounts)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Dude I yell at my parents for accumulating too many tabs because it slows their computers down.... BUT DANG</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That... How?</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: :::O</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay, 342 technically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and it's because I open a bunch of things to do stuff, leave them open and close firefox, next day the tabs are in session restore (not actually /loaded/ due to Tabs On Demand, which the chrome devs refuse to implement faksjfljlfal), I forget why they were open, pile more stuff on top, repeat until good grief</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (in fact, Chrome's explicit absence of Tabs On Demand is the only thing keeping it at a much saner 8 tabs in session restore)</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I tend to try and limit my tabs, more option to dig through history or take convoluted link paths to refind things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *what is grammar ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *opting ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the main reason I leave shit open rather than bookmark is because it preserves per-tab history, so I theoretically have a chance of remembering why the fuck the thing was open to begin with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: shrug ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, CS, did you remember to mention in the credits page that I answered a fair handful of the asks? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, every few months I have to go through each tab, see what was happening in there. nothing interesting, just close it. might want to read later, shove it into a bookmarks folder aptly named "Read-Later Captchalogues" then close it. or if it's a YT video, shove into the watch-later playlist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and clearly I'm overdue to do that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I still wonder if anyone managed to figure out the sequence of hypothetical events behind the turning point post. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty much, Seth originally posted the panel link on the chumplist, and then Ornis reblogged it before Chronos could delete the post. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, that</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh yeaaah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That explains why it was reblogged, but not on the original blog okay.</span><br />
