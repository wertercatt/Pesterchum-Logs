<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't think my hotel character is the same as my v2 character :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: but not go on that site</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Although they're relatively similar :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Not the same story canon :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think the question was more "does your v2 char control your hotel char" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yes eridan is the gooniest character in hs</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Don't see why my v2 character wouldn't :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So I guess that would be a yes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: So there's a hotel?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then, get ready for the confusing meta next time there's a hotel event. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yes :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It will be confusing since :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I both control the hotel character with my v2 character and out of character me :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: gah, that would be confusing :&gt;</span><br />
