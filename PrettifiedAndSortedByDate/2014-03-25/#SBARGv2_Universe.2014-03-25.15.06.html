[17:11:11] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And I went in a bunch of circles in the forest</span><br />

[17:21:05] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Because its making you feel bad, and thats bad. ))</span><br />
[17:22:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I shouldn't be spared for the sake of feeling better, there's more important things to focus on, like this RP's reputation which I've repeatedly tarnished by letting others do what they want))</span><br />

[17:24:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...I think the problem is, when you drew the outline of Neon, you drew it assuming Starter was the size of a Land and not an actual full-blown planet...))</span><br />

[17:27:29] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Okay, lets assume 13 meters. ))</span><br />
[17:28:04] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Which would make the radius of a planet about... a single kilometer o_o ))</span><br />

[17:30:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah, probably.))</span><br />
[17:31:16] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Then should I go off of the size of the Beat Mesa on Dave's land? ))</span><br />
[17:31:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((let's just say 10km diameter, because it's a nice round number in between "Mario Galaxy baby planet" and "motherfucking Couresant"))</span><br />
