[10:46:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is now sitting cross-legged in midair, half-leaning against the window*</span><br />
[10:46:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So first you practically call me here, and now you try to run away.</span><br />
[10:46:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I WAS NOT CALLING YOU HERE</span><br />
[10:46:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I WAS THINKING YOU WERE HERE AND GONNA SAY SOMETHING AND-</span><br />
[10:46:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh fucks</span><br />
[10:47:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You were repeatedly insisting that I was here. So I showed up.</span><br />
[10:47:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  glances at LS... --</span><br />
[10:47:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you have a death wish or something?</span><br />
[10:47:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  runs to the Transportalizer --</span><br />
[10:47:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RUN AND FLEE, RUN AND FLEE</span><br />
[10:47:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Heh…</span><br />
[10:47:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You can run, but you can't hide.</span><br />
[10:47:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm the Session's best tracker, you know.</span><br />
[10:47:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  warps... to the third floor. NOONE WOULD EXPECT THAT --</span><br />
[10:48:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *simply floats up through the ceiling, taking this one floor at a time*</span><br />
[10:48:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[10:48:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: meep</span><br />
[10:48:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why do you keep running?</span><br />
[10:48:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  leaps back --</span><br />

[10:49:34] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *checks all the upper floors before sighing and gliding down through the floors until she reaches his fort* Pitiful, really… as could only be expected by the constant pity parties you keep holding. It's part of what makes me wonder if you're suicidal after all.</span><br />
[10:54:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How long are you going to keep running for?</span><br />
[10:55:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You got me here, after all. I was /perfectly/ content to be where I was, but nooo.</span><br />
[11:02:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You question if I am suicidal, yet I'm one of the /few/ people who hasn't run off to kill themselves on a quest bed.</span><br />
[11:03:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, I've made up excuses so people won't force me to do it.</span><br />
