[16:35:10] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Hey, FL. What's up?</span><br />
[16:35:29] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: holy hell, don't spook me like tha</span><br />
[16:35:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: that*</span><br />
[16:36:04] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Ekekekeke, sorry. ^_^</span><br />
[16:54:59] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I'm just... not really thinking straight today.</span><br />
[16:58:00] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: I'm sorry to hear that. Something wrong?</span><br />
[16:58:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Nothing that you would be able to help.</span><br />
[16:59:49] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Try me. I'm a good listener.</span><br />
[17:11:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I</span><br />
[17:11:27] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I'd rather not.</span><br />
[17:11:36] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: If you say so.</span><br />
[17:11:45] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: I'm still here if you need someone to talk to.</span><br />
[17:11:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So uh, how is Cookie?</span><br />
[17:12:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (If I'm getting names mixed up again I'm sorry)</span><br />
[17:12:05] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Good. Lazy like always.</span><br />
[17:12:09] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: (No you're fine)</span><br />
[17:12:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Can he still talk, or did he lose the ability?</span><br />
[17:13:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I'm trying to see what sort of effects the door has on sprites.</span><br />
[17:13:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, Elsey can talk, and she wasn't even made from anything that started out alive</span><br />
[17:13:58] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Then again, Magics</span><br />
[17:14:44] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: She can talk still, surprisingly. And she can sometimes stand up on her hind legs- hey-</span><br />
[17:14:47] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: MEOW</span><br />
[17:14:52] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: MEOHI</span><br />
[17:14:56] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Cookie no</span><br />
[17:15:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And She likes to Meow.</span><br />
[17:15:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alright, so 2/2 sprites can talk still.</span><br />
[17:16:16] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Are Elsey and Cookie the only sprites still around?</span><br />

[17:18:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Emote crash?</span><br />
[17:18:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: [03:16] CURRENT artisticAuthor [CAA] RIGHT NOW responded to memo. [03:16] CAA: Are Elsey and Cookie the only sprites still around? [03:16] CCP: yeah, think so. [03:16] CAA: Oh, hey CP</span><br />
[17:18:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, it couldn't be emote crash since I have animations disabled.</span><br />
[17:18:44] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Well, /I/ didn't post Zalgo- wait, you use strife kind</span><br />
[17:18:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either pchum itself glitched, or...</span><br />
[17:19:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, strifekind is zalgoproof.</span><br />
[17:19:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...though there was that one time everyone was spamming square brackets and killed half the memo...</span><br />
[17:19:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I should see about patching steamchum so its zalgo proof as well.</span><br />
[17:19:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Fixed width is pretty cool, to be honest</span><br />
[17:19:52] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[17:20:01] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: o-o</span><br />
[17:20:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, what was between my paste and yours?</span><br />
[17:20:05] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I know what to call my edited them</span><br />
[17:20:07] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: theme*</span><br />
[17:20:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: and nothing</span><br />
[17:20:28] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Theme: Encryption Modus</span><br />
[17:20:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Dark like Steamchum, but has fixed width and green /me commands</span><br />
[17:21:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nice</span><br />
[17:23:51] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Awesome.</span><br />
[17:24:59] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Man, could you even imagine what life would have been like on earth if we had fetch modi back there?</span><br />
[17:25:39] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: My only comment is,</span><br />
[17:25:41] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Holy fudging ship.</span><br />
[17:26:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...okay, what that your head exploding or did something happen</span><br />
[17:26:22] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: was that*</span><br />
[17:27:15] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Mind = blown</span><br />
[17:27:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: okay yeah</span><br />
[17:28:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Easy, low mass packaging for space flight, deploying spaceships while /in/ space, sending objects through the mail...</span><br />
[17:28:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...the possibilitys are endless.</span><br />
[17:28:45] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: That would be so awesome. O_O</span><br />
[17:29:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[17:29:12] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: We should mass produce the stuff on our planet and take advantage of it.</span><br />
[17:29:20] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Hells yes.</span><br />
[17:30:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Heck, I might be able to figure out a way to send objects through the internet if I research this stuff enough.</span><br />
[17:31:03] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, it would likely take massive studying of my filesystem modus and the juju modus, but it should be doable.</span><br />
[17:31:10] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: I would help but I'm not very tech-savvy. I love the internet but I am not good at coding and stuff like that.</span><br />
[17:33:23] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: The only coding I know is from throwing alchemized discs of codes together, and small bits of Javascript, Basic, and Lua</span><br />
[17:33:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Oh, and using my Gameshark/Action Replay</span><br />
[17:35:19] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: At least I won't be programming in brainfuck</span><br />
[17:35:27] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (@_@)</span><br />
[17:35:56] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL:  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck</a></span><br />
[17:36:04] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: seriously its an actual programming language</span><br />
[17:36:20] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ...</span><br />
[17:36:21] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Seriously?</span><br />
[17:36:22] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: OH my god.</span><br />
[17:36:32] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: It literally is a brainfuck.</span><br />
[18:38:49] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Gonna go, guys. See you later.</span><br />
[18:38:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CAA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[18:41:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...soooo</span><br />
[19:39:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Kimura, what are /you/ doing?</span><br />
[19:43:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[19:44:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...dammit</span><br />
[19:44:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Funny how we can handle sburb perfectly well, but if we didn't bring anything through the door, we would be starving to death right now.</span><br />
[19:44:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Ha. Ha.</span><br />
[19:45:05] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...ha.</span><br />
[19:46:57] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I'm starting to think a failed session would have been better than this.</span><br />
[19:47:49] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: except then we would have time players going back, having us cease to exist.</span><br />
[19:50:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And if we tried to convince our past selves /not/ to go through the door, they wouldn't listen</span><br />
[19:51:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: They would just bite right into that forbidden fruit</span><br />
[19:52:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[19:54:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Knowing what its like here... I would have rather stayed inside.</span><br />
[19:55:04] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But being inside, without knowing... I would have wanted out.</span><br />
[19:58:42] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So uh... I guess I hate the one way door?</span><br />
[19:59:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[19:59:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually...</span><br />
[19:59:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...maybe I should just look for an exile station on another planet with a way back in the session.</span><br />
[19:59:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think the one-way door might be a /safety feature/.</span><br />
[19:59:52] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...What.</span><br />
[19:59:59] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
[20:00:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: to prevent people from the universe escaping into the session and destroying the frog.</span><br />
[20:00:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: To prevent the frog from dying.</span><br />
[20:00:23] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Alright, so I'm going to need to gank a white queens key</span><br />
[20:00:59] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Since that seems to be a workaround said safety feature...</span><br />
[20:02:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I just guess I want to go back to the life of punch card alchemy and exploits</span><br />
[20:02:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably. it's a way back in case of extreme emergency, but not easily accessible because first you have to find a planet with one.</span><br />
[20:02:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: since that was the shit I was actually good at</span><br />
[20:03:21] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: What am I good at now, without any of the sburb doodads?</span><br />
[20:04:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Heh... I just guess all I'm exploiting now... is nothing.</span><br />
[20:06:47] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: If I'm a god of anything, its Hindsight.</span><br />
[20:07:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: since I'm always looking back at how I fucked up</span><br />
[20:07:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pft</span><br />
[20:53:04] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I better get back to work</span><br />
[20:53:13] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I'm pretty sure I can get this to work /soon/.</span><br />
