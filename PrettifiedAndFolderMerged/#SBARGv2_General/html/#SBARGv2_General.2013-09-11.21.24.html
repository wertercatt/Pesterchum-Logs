<span style="color:#133295">CEP: your hometown gets destroyed, you get separated from your friends, you watch a monster suck out someone's soul and eat it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and then the disney villains actually become distorted from the heartless :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It actually kind of feels like they toned some stuff down when I wished they'd push towards more adult themed stuff. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, SJ, you know parasite steve? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I've heard that name</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He's CC/DD in the rp :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Anyway, his name is based on Parasite Eve, which was a game I quite enjoyed for PS1. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It was like silent hill in rpg format. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: There was this chemical/magical virus thing that was transforming the animals into grotesque things and you played as a cop who was trying to figure out why :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#60bc0b">CRD: :0</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: all the while, there's this magical being who controls it all who has some connection to the main character, though she doesn't know what the connection is :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: One of the creepiest parts was when this kid, who was the son of one of the police officers, had this police dog as a pet :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And then the pet transformed into a monster like cerebus :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and it was both really creepy and sad :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: since the dog was so friendly and then it became this horrific monster dog that you had to kill :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: they had a second parasite eve, which I haven't played :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and a third game for the psp, but that was more of a third person shooter :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: oh, speaking of video game ideas :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What if Nathan Drake from Uncharted and Lara Croft from Tomb Raider teamed up? :&gt;</span><br />
