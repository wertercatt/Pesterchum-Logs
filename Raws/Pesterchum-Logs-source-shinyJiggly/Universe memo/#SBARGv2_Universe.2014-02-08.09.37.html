<span style="color:#000000">CFI: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty sure we don't have a cheese factory around here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: hay FI</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: be fore Kat whent missing did any of you notice anything unusual?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Aside from the fact that she was getting increasingly hostile in general towards everyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, the katstle shenanigans for one. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I would try it, but not sure if it would work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it might have a chance of killing her or me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or both</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: try what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, what are you planning? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Also are we in any danger from Azure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, if anyone would be in danger from Azure, it would be me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Hm... wish I had one of Gambit's cards. Would make finding her a non-issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: mαybe she just wαnts to be left the fuck αlone</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I was kinda thinking of using Kat as a flare target... but that carries the risk of telefrag.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But If I stayed in soul state...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, I doubt I'll try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Doesn't sound a very trustworthy method, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, so its agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not doing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: And Seth, the last couple of times we "left her the fuck alone," things only got worse for basically everyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: whαt did she do then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: I believe one time she threatened to blow up her planet and everyone on it (which was about 10-15 people or so) if they didn't leave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: wtf</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: I may be remembering incorrectly. I wasn't actually present, I was just sent the logs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yes... that incident... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the bacafe ban</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: er, <span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafé</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I have an idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we need a breath player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Along with DS's sensors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: why a breath player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kat's barrier prevented all objects from passing through, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Uh-huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: oh i see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So what we do is induce planetary rainfall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: but air still has to get through</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: just enough to find the barrier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: If we cant get a breath player I have schimatics for weather control satalites</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure that's even a remotely good idea for the environment? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: not flod levels Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like seriously, it'll at least mess up the weather patterns. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even if it is just a sprinkle ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: it rains in the desert Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: just less oftan</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what part of "don't screw with the weather or it screws with you" is so hard to understand? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: What would you propose the Breath Player do though, Charles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: make it rain and then look for a dry cercal</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why did I read that as "dry cerial" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: your not the onlyu one</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hey guys</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: hay SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, can you use your maidly powers to search for false life?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (aka life aspect animated dolls)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: specifically life-affiliated stuff should be pretty easy to find... gimme a sec</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pretty sure there is a way to do this for every aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((TT, can i detect any dolls))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((no.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...nothing out of sorts that i can detect</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Niki, could you hop to the future and give us her location?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Ok Im in the Republics sensor lab</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Assuming the information was gotten via timetravel in the future?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (wanna keep the timeloop stable.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, last time I tryed to do a timey thing anywhere near her, it backfired ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: no taking the tymy wimy way out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EQ, could you buff the alien dudes psychic abilitys so he can try to find where she is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: I dont think that would go well</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Woah Okay I was distracted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Can someone fill me in on what is being requested and why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay alien dude says no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (glad he can read the memo through my eyes)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay. Yeah. Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So Life, Time, and Mind are ruled out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and we don't want to do Breath or Heart...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, not my way of doing heart at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: space or void might could tell where the castle went</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, a change in the location after all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Light would /know/ outright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since Luck and Knowledge is their forte.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: possibly</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: So we wate for Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about a Blood player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hunt her down by the BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hope and Rage um... not so sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Doom player would be able to see if anything is about to go wrong in a doomed timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: Mm... I think maybe Rob could find her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: But seeing as how he's not online...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, he is better at the Heart gig.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: doom could just discover how fate is going to go</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hannah, if you were Kat, where would you hide a castle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: the north?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we could go to space</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, the sad thing is: I'm not kat so I wouldnt know. Maybe some place in solitude, like on a mountian yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I know where she would be if we can't find her with the weather</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a satelite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm thinking Kat might be underground or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If possible, I would have a castle underground or maybe in the air. But that's just me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: underground? i dunno...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not sure if thats really kat's place</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, could you like... talk to the plants and see if they know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeaaaaaah...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay I'll turn myself into a soul and try to use my connections to her to go directly to her. Except that could telefrag her or worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i cant talk to plants</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: they dont have brains</span><br />
