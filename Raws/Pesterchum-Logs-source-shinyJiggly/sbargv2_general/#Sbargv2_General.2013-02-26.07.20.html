<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 GENERAL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0037ff">CURRENT anomalousEntity [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: so lonely in here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: just the two of us</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: and silence</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: and the forums are still not up</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i mean gog damn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: it's becoming tragic by this point</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i'm making a puzzle here</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ooooh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: it's impossible</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: it is so resistant to free association</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i mean come on</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i have all the elements</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: and as much as i have them, i have problems connecting them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: even though i know they can connect perfectly</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe you need to sleep on the problem. Sometimes some great solutions pop up after a while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i've slept 10 hours today</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: it should've dawned on me twice at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then just keep thinking about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i will</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i need to make some noise around DG once i get the chance to resume it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just make sure that you have a somewhat steady flow of updates to feed them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: it will be interestingly different to all the other sburbventures</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i'll try</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: mainly because i've put sburb into the background</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: not that i've orphaned the sburb mechanics</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: they are just going to play a different role</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I understand. the medium is just the medium. I personally think that a sburban setting is best suited to being more of a stage than the main attraction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i still have no idea for the lands</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i wanted to ditch the lands, and just put a huge single planet as the stage, but that would've killed variety</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: that's one of the things homestuck bothers me with</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: the lands are impeccably designed</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: but explored very little</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: sure, you have the denizens and the quests, but you still do not go into the lands in-depth</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: oh fux</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i forgot to define the characters' ages</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i don't know whether to make them 16 or 19 years old</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: not that it'll matter all too much</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think 19 might fit them slightly better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: okay then</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: 19 it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: mostly because it's easier to write 19 year-olds since i'm still pretty similar to my 19 year-old self psychologically</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: i have a hunch DP is making Visorman/Desk Jockey/Calipt/whatever else people call him fan art</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I gotta go now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: good luck on your work with double gameboard.</span><br />
