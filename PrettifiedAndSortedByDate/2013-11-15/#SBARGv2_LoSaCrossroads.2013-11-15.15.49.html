[03:49:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 LOSACROSSROADS.</span><br />
[03:50:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:50:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals in at the dwelling spire, looking around cautiously --</span><br />
[03:52:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of sits around and waits for FL to port in --</span><br />
[03:52:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // ...fuck. Are those Lich Queens? --</span><br />
[03:52:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // 1... 2... 3... 4...... oh fuck theres 5. --</span><br />
[03:53:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  promptly Lucky Mallets himself and hides in the rubble --</span><br />
[03:53:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // One of the Lich Queens stares in CP's direction, as if they can see through walls. --</span><br />
[03:54:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //how can it see something an inch tall? they're not supposed to be fucking psychic... --</span><br />
[03:54:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //or rather, have telescopes for eyes... --</span><br />
[03:55:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // It seems the entire land has become a high level Atomyk Ebonpyre. --</span><br />
[03:56:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: come on FL, hurry up...</span><br />
[03:56:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // One of the Lich Queens begins to charge up a ball of energy... --</span><br />
[03:56:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  prepares to portal-dodge --</span><br />
[03:57:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Lich Queen fires at the rubble, the other Lich Queens activating... spellcards. Fuck. --</span><br />
[03:57:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // BULLET HELL --</span><br />
[03:58:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portaldodges upward --</span><br />
[03:58:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // One of the magical bullets misses you by an inch. --</span><br />
[03:59:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:59:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  appears. --</span><br />
[03:59:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I used you as a waypoint Kimura the hell is this...?!</span><br />
[03:59:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  activates a Boo's Sheet, going intangible... it lasts for 30sec each, but he only has to wait a few more minutes for FL to port in...! --</span><br />
[03:59:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dude, dodge!</span><br />
[03:59:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // 5 Lich Queens, the entire land is an Atomyk Ebonpyre. --</span><br />
[03:59:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Thats pretty much all there is to say on the matter. --</span><br />
[04:00:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  glances at the Lich Queens --</span><br />
[04:00:12] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Is that all?</span><br />
[04:00:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Lich Queens appear to have Dark Souls, and Touhou prototypes. --</span><br />
[04:01:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gives RS a semi-transparent look of "you serious?" --</span><br />
[04:01:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  sighs. --</span><br />
[04:01:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  glances at CP. --</span><br />
[04:01:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // RS, there are bullets flying everywhere. --</span><br />
[04:01:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  finally shows up in a burst of flames, where his bedroom used to be. --</span><br />
[04:02:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey gu- HOLY FUCK</span><br />
[04:02:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  yawns, body becoming see-through with a faint pink outline as they pass through him. --</span><br />
[04:02:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do I need to kill anything? Because I'd be okay with that.</span><br />
[04:02:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I wonder if Lich Queens drop souls...</span><br />
[04:02:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that would be helpful!</span><br />
[04:02:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Boo's Sheet wears off, but he's still Issun-sized... --</span><br />
[04:03:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out his sword, and slashes at the bullets coming his way, sliceing them... and for some reason, the energy being pulled into his sword? --</span><br />
[04:03:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[04:03:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at his sword, with a questioning look. --</span><br />
[04:04:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  draws a sword with a red and gold handle, and an obsidian blade, leveling it at the closest Queen before leaping into the air directly above it. --</span><br />
[04:05:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  comes down with a clean slice that bisects it down the middle, spliting it into two even halves. --</span><br />
[04:05:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unleashes jawbreakery hell on the same queen, making sure it /stays/ down --</span><br />
[04:05:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The lich queens look at FL then RS, then determine RS as the greatest threat, considering how the queen just /exploded into grist/. --</span><br />
[04:06:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Liches use Love Sign "Master Spark"! --</span><br />
[04:06:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // lich queens* --</span><br />
[04:06:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  smirks. --</span><br />
[04:07:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Blitzkampf Breakbeat.</span><br />
[04:08:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Lasers quickly approach RS, that better do something.. --</span><br />
[04:08:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  a low quake runs through the area as his eyes turn red, soul wisping off him as he reels back and charges toward the blast, cutting it into two clean halves that impact behind him. --</span><br />
[04:08:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just stays the fuck out of the way of that --</span><br />
[04:09:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  kicks at the air, an explosion driving him toward the closest before he throws his fist forward and breaks through the thing completely, coming out the other end. --</span><br />
[04:09:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just gathering up energy, protecting CP from any stray shots. --</span><br />
[04:09:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Lich Queens destroyed 2/5 --</span><br />
[04:10:19] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Lich Queens... You had so much trouble with /Lich/ Queens? Seriously? Man to hell with this, I don't even need Scrapyard for this...</span><br />
[04:10:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Lich Queens pause... before firing Green bolts of energy. --</span><br />
[04:10:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh fuck</span><br />
[04:11:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hey, uh... would you say this is an appropriate time for a Mega Star? because I'm kind of thinking that...</span><br />
[04:11:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  lands, dashing toward the nearest living LQ. --</span><br />
[04:11:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mega Star...</span><br />
[04:11:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's /work/. And time.</span><br />
[04:12:02] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just sit there and watch, I'll end this quicker.</span><br />
[04:12:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...eh, true. may as well save it for SL's denizen thing then.</span><br />
[04:12:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Lich Queens shoot at RS, trying to pin him. --</span><br />
[04:13:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  figures he'll at least do SOMETHING though, and uses Delfino Refrain to boost the party's luck (because dodging = yes) --</span><br />
[04:14:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  weaves between the shots as he closes distance, a few hitting head on. His charge doesn't slow in the least though, and so in range he makes two slashes so quick as to seem concorrent, a diagonal set forming an X centered on that LQ. --</span><br />
[04:15:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  one explosive dash toward the next and the shots that almost certainly head for him meet their mark by and large! --</span><br />
[04:16:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  ...Making it a shame when his only reaction is a lack of one, twisting his body in midair to decapatate that Queen. --</span><br />
[04:16:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Lich Queen not only explodes, but it explodes fancily shooting all of the grist into space. --</span><br />
[04:16:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The final Lich Queen decides to pick off the weaker targets, looking at FL and CP. --</span><br />
[04:17:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // A bolt of Green energy is fired. --</span><br />
[04:18:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly raises his sword in an attempt to block... --</span><br />
[04:18:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws a brushportal in front of the pair of them --</span><br />
[04:18:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How troublesome...</span><br />
[04:19:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The Brush Portal redirects the shot, taking out the lich queen with its own attack. --</span><br />
[04:19:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // If the team had any levels left to gain on the etchladder, they would have just gotten all of the levels. --</span><br />
[04:20:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Quaking can be felt... --</span><br />
[04:20:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh god, what now.</span><br />
[04:20:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //so instead, FL and CP gain a large chunk of XP toward the next GT rung? --</span><br />
[04:20:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Yes. --</span><br />
[04:20:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...great, another LoSaQuake...</span><br />
[04:21:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // FL gets a new badge on his kiddysash... Instant Fray Activation. --</span><br />
[04:22:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // FL no longer needs to say the name of a fraymotif to activate it! --</span><br />
[04:22:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //aw, but calling attacks is half the fun! ...well, being able to fraymotif while mute is probably useful... --</span><br />
[04:23:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  still doesn't get why silencing prevents Mario from jumping... --</span><br />
[04:23:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... where we going now?</span><br />
[04:23:50] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  also gained an extra 12,241,630 xp. --</span><br />
[04:24:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think we should get off the land.</span><br />
[04:24:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. but where to?</span><br />
[04:24:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Fire explodes out of pipes in the base of the dwelling spire, moving up. --</span><br />
[04:24:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SHIT</span><br />
[04:24:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING</span><br />
[04:25:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: White Void Room in the Magicant then?</span><br />
[04:25:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or did Ash destroy that house?</span><br />
[04:26:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /YOU CAN'T WARP IN THE MAGICAN-</span><br />

[04:26:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME</span><br />
[04:26:24] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: should i /care/</span><br />
[04:26:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks off the ledge... Fire is all over the land. --</span><br />
[04:26:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Shit, the oil ignited.</span><br />
[04:28:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...aaanyway, yes you can't warp there, but the Door Station that I left in there a few days ago is still a thing, and the other door is on Prospit.</span><br />

[04:28:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets go.</span><br />
[04:29:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  opens a portal to right outside his dream spire --</span><br />
[04:29:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks back at where the last remants of his house used to be. --</span><br />

[04:29:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((no need for memo switch))</span><br />
[04:29:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  runs in. --</span><br />
[04:29:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so why did your land go Keter again?</span><br />
[04:30:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The land itself died.</span><br />
[04:30:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...How does that happen?</span><br />
[04:30:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...guess that was your denizen's final act of defiance, then. throwing your land into cardiac arrest or something.</span><br />
[04:31:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah.</span><br />
[04:31:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[04:32:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks for the door. --</span><br />
[04:33:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows, digging behind the alchemiter for the door --</span><br />
[04:33:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...found it.</span><br />
[04:33:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kimura, would you mind... closing the portal?</span><br />
[04:34:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, almost forgot to.</span><br />
[04:34:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The oil pipes kinda go deep into the land...</span><br />
[04:34:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  makes sure RS got through, then closes it --</span><br />

[04:37:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe you need to plug it in?</span><br />
