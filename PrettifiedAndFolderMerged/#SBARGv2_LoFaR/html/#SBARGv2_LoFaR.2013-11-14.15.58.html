<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  in his defense, it's actually a really cool looking spear, wrought iron staff with a large top piece somewhat resembling the chitauri scepter but nooot really, golden bits to it as well, There's a black ball in the connection from the staff to the blade, other than that totally radical spear. Looks like there's a tooth sticking out the back of the blade, making it like a little...weird halberd. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals back to Prospit, more than a little weirded out seeing MP like that (the spear curse thing, not...) --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  goes over, walking over to the nearest and largest tree he can find, touching the spear to it. It promptly vanishes away into ash, the spear's blade now glowing black and blue creepily. --</span><br />
