<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I guess I /could/ on someone else but, nah. You know how it is, I've gotta keep the crazy things I can do under wrap until it's most dramatically appropriate to bust 'em out.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay well really it wouldn't really mean anything?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You're all like "there is no one to test things on!" and then you're all like "FS is the only one!" and it's like boooriiing xPPP</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some fancy trick RS wants to not show off yet ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How can you even manage to do so much stuff without going god-tier, anyway? That just seems sorta wrong somehow… :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Temper Symphonic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...wait, RS, you haven't died and become godly yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Simple words now plz.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Those were some pretty simple words I thought</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Also, thats a stupid answer. Basically, he pracriced.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yes, but I don't understand what it means.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Like me learning how to shoot lightning and shout down the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: But yeah, Trainign helps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And still, that he has access to like everyfin and is uber-magic when he hasn't done the thing where he is s'posed to gain access to even murr of his powers and become more fully realised just kinda is… :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There's a bunch of stuff I haven't even tapped into as far as that move goes, seeing as it's tied to my emotions. Getting in the right state, experimenting with it's off-shoots and such... there's a lot to it, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That doesn't stop either the question of /what is it/ or /why/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Temper Symphonic's a Fray I learned from Daedalus that makes flames based on my emotions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ohhh it's where you become a fireRaz. Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Go, Raz!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Use Fire Blast!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfffffffft</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its Super Effective!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … now I kinda want to dump a cup of water on your head to see what happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nothing, probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...do it anyways, gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Water Sport?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, you're a fire-type, so water-type moves should be super effective… x333</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He might just be a pokemon that happens to know a fire type move</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm probably Fire/Fighting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: i'm a starter</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like Machamp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nyooo, he's very fire. Much flame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: such flame</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: so hot</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit used water sport!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fire's power was weakened!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Rob used Thunderpunch</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I have no idea what type I'd be... considering I know moves from at least four types... /and that's just with the Brush/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … That kinda makes sense because Fire/Fighting would be weak to Psychic. Which could be /Mind/! :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Since Gambit's apparently a Water-type</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nyooope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I gots lightning resistance because I fight FF so much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Also because I kept /shocking the hell out of myself/ DDD:</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: .....:\</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Shes a Whiscash.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Water/Ground</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's got resistance to Fire and Thunder?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Hm... would classify you as a dark type, gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm weak to Psychic, though…</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: and I think ground and steel, Gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Flying...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit has /got/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To be a Fairy/Dark type</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dark has Psychic immunity, though!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, Ghost/something</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So I /can't/ be that, beclaws I'd bet it's super-effective! And… hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ghost/Fire?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: One of those chandelier pokemon that Kat likes so much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...yeah, you set me on fire enough tines for that, gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ghost/Poison</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … why /poison/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why would you be /fire/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Fire cards and a tendency to set things on fire to watch them burn or because I can?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: What Gambit said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, Psychic is good against Fighting and Poison types.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, super effective.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, rigid pokemon typing is confusing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not really, I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On another note, I taught my Delphox in Y Power Up Punch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Miaow, I think I'd be x0 with Fire, Thunder; x1/2 with Dark, Ghost; x4 with Psychic… And I don't know what has that. Hrm. Raz, what're you? :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I was /sick/ of Dark types kicking my ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only way you would take 4x damage from Psychic is if you were a Fighting/Poison type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: didn't we have a discussion like this a few months ago? I know we found out that most aspects don't line up with a type very well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but we aren't matching up aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Except for mine. I'm pretty much pure Flying, aren't I? Heh heh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we are matching up /people/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I haven't played enough against those other move-types to know if I'm weak against any of them but Mind powers/games are hella scary so.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: shit gtg afk</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might wanna click show all types</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: See ya!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normal/Ghost type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we can agree on one thing though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit has Wonder Guard.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually that could make sense. considering how random her land is, the ultimate treasure might be an action replay set to inject random "cheats" (read: junk data) on a regular basis.</span><br />
