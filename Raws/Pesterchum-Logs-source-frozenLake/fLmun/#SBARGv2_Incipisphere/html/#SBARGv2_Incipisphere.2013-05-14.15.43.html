<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The hangover.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What was I thinking...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was about to ask the same thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...anyway, I have a theory about all of these glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, in a session, Skaia has time to adapt when ever we enter with a prototype.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But, considering most of us entered within the same moment... Well, remember mspa on 10/25/11?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yes, the Cascade newgrounds crash...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: who could forget that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We managed to DOS Newgrounds from trying to all watch the video.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, imagine the same thing happening to skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though something tells me there's been bigger sessions out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other than the 20 of us on the gate list, I imagine we have about a hundred people in this session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All going in moments within each other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We DOSed Skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are responsible for the glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but wait a minute, I heard that Skaia was messed up even before entry</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#008b00">CURRENT doctorSpace [CDS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well I think all the gliches before that didn't help</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes and Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: before entry that is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe that some of the glitchs somehow made it backwards in time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: the pre entry gliches probubly pushed it over the edge</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If Time players and meteors can time travel, what stopping glitches from doing the same thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was thinking sorta the same thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#eacf00">CURRENT lunarLemonade [CLL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: perhaps fixing the glitches involves creating them in the first place</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: S H E N A N I G A N S</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: *cough*pulleditoufmynose*cough*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I checked my files, and was wondering what this broken mess of code was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: two wrongs don't make a right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll see if I can fix it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff660d">CURRENT squealingVermin [CSV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And I return from training in the gym and goddamn. SOmeone is talking about creating glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Someone, tell me whatsup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: LL was just brainstorming on how to fix them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I believe our rapid prototyping caused Skaia to go over the edge glitch wise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: a-ight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: don't look at me like that D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No time for skaia to form right, no time for the lands to spawn correctly, no time for the gates to form right...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You get the idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Sburb has all the time it wants</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: in a way</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and no time for aspects to be correctly assigned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: so maybe it's more linked to external events</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, those all normally occur retroactively due to entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: FL your forgeting something</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: most paradoxes can't even happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: no ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: no meteor sending stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes DS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it's obvious that the lack of these two things messed up a few things</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Once our planets are spawned they have always have been there... right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: unless the glitcfhes themselves influenced the way there never was any ectobiology at work</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Retroactive spawning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: oh my</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If one does not get in the session, the planet never spawns.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((this is so silly))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: also I remember the gardean mentioning that our univers was never suposed to have a session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: they don't spawn retroactively, but once the lands are made, on the lands themselves it is as if they were always there</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which would explain the lack of ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: if a Time player goes back to before a certain player entered, their land won't be there until they actually do enter</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, like when you start up dwarf fortress, it makes history.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: that's a pretty good analogy</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: also I remember the gardean mentioning that our univers was never suposed to have a session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which would explain the lack of ectobiology</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, say your running say, 50 instances of the dwarf fortress generation at once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: oh my</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: in the Void Session, Roxy/Dirk/Jake's planets appeared after Jane's, but they still looked "millions of years too old"</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thats a bit extream</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: So then</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: This is the reverse</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (could it be ?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: of a void session ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: instead of no prototyping there's THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I believe so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: so, Skaian overload ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Skaia will likely be the site of the most glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what is the reverse of a void session anyways? a light session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Such as the clouds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: we're more on the scale of the Squiddle Session, but with more than 48 players</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: shit with so many prospit dreamers the skaian sky must be all clouds</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, thats more ammount of towers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: Null is everything goes right but doomed to fail, Void is no-protos, Dead is singleplayer... we are None Of The Above.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The moon is a spikey ball.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a death star?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sorry, bad joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...no, imagine extruding all the faces on a sphere 3d model.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Squiddle Session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: 'the prospit moon is fucking big sir'</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: 'how big ?'</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: JUPITER.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: 'like the size of texas sir'</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: OH SHIT</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: DS: the one Hussie joked about, the 48-player session that made Beforus/Alternia</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: CFL: The moon is a spikey ball.  &lt;- I had that idea about a Prospit-themed flail weapon</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes sir, we are on seige by planet fucking jupiter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Prospic Flail</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Thats alot of water</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...pardon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does water have to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: squiddle session</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: to suport Squiddles the incipisphere must hev been a big ball ow water</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...on the lands themselves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, the medium might have had the ability to support them without water</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I think sburb has an intended max playercount of 144 (12 normal classes * 12 aspects)... any more than that and you have to double up on claspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: that'd explain a lot</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And/Or you get wierd stuff like the Lord of Blood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Lord of Space</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: though maybe it'd be dividing major aspects in two or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: except Lord and Muse are only available in one- and two-player sessions...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: usually</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ is right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I mean extrapolating on existing aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are in a glitching mess, so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we have lost at least 2 players already apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: "Your title is the <a href='#e'>#e</a>@9$ù$ of é8888,znb"</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: 'Have fun"</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (/////) (/////) (/////) (/////)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And how items that should normally be alchemized are spawning in the world gen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the Super Paper Mario apples.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, those things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though I've onlyheard about them appearing on your end.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Excuse me, i shall be out of contact for a little while for i'm now going to take a shower.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: speaking of... I wonder if the glitches are because FG got lazy and started patching in code from other games</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: "what happens if I change that ini line ? OH SHIT"</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: the SPM apples from the Overthere, my land's consort villages and denizen palace ripping off Thousand-Year Door Chapter 7...</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: hehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, how would you normally make those overthere apples?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Super Paper Mario &amp;&amp; Apples?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: usually they spawn on trees when you enter a part of the level IIRC</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: and the fact that the Okami things I've alchemized work seamlessly, plus according to Ammysprite, it was always intended to be part of my quest</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: FL: captcharoid zoomed in on an SPM screenshot, a pictionary scribblepad, or idk</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, I used captcharoid to make the Sky Gem from Sonic 06.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Also ho easaly I can make star trek themed stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh man, I just had the worst thought. What if there was code from Big Rigs Racing in this session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: from what now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH GOD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I remembered its name correctly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one where you go to crazy speed backward?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually it says 1/0 artifact grist.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: also it gibes me an idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: Artifact Grist is an ironic thing, normally only gained by making sbahj-class items. I don't think it has any practical use other than clogging Grist Gutters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we don't have to worry about making any more artifact grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, the grist gutter is limitless.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I was kidding</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: physics are a joke in this game, even without all the bugs. our architecturally-impossible dwelling spires are proof enough, never mind relativistic baseballs.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we need to worry about infinite energy making black holes engulfing... everything.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thus it is not a worm hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All the matter is just focused at one point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Forever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: matter/energy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, except the rig itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: which would contenue on for infinity?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and drain the green sun</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As the rig is exceeding the speed of light...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually just say it teleport hops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...like the "movement" of pixels on a screen.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, when you quickly move a laser pointer pointing at the moon, you are not breaking the speed of light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The universe just calculates its current position, then moves it, fliping off physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Who thinks the big rig is gonna keep going through the furthest ring and continue accelrating?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and destroying all of parodox space in its wake?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: no, the one I made hit a meteor immediately, hard enough to knock it two hours into the past and then fall to LOSAC</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: but if one hits the <span style="color:#00ff00">Sun</span>...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, casuality does not matter in the furthest ring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((some one should ask this on what if xkcd))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it could have been bumped into the furthest ring, then turned around by the space time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: posebly</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and come stait back</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: no i just have a slight headach</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: no, 413 boonbucks says it'd come back in time, hit the person that made it, causing them to fall into the alchemiter screen and create the rig in the first place</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: funny how those things tendto work out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I may not be a Time player, but I definitely understand at least basic principles of Weird Time Shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And since it would be 2 meteors, it wouldn't be the same one looping forever, so no object paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: like the Doctor said "by and large most parodoxes resolve themselves"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But there is an information paradox...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ...in fact, the fact that Time isn't my aspect is probably why thinking about furthest ring physics doesn't drive me shithive maggots</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless you already made the code... in which case, It doesn't matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: solved by a simple bootstrap, perfectly legal in paradox space.</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: well, maybe not knowing what to do when, but definitely knowing HOW to Do The Aspecty Thing comes with the hoodie</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: or are fixed alredy</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: some one should ask the gardean</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: no, I don't think so. my bed is still missingtexture.vtf even though I know my aspect.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I refuse to bleave that Sbarg runs on the Scorce engen.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: how...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it would explain some stuff, like how the Guardian seems to run on valve time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: but he/she can cont to 3</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: he's probably too focused getting Gate 4 fixed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And aspect powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not to mention dealing with that "the glitch" thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: also speaking of game crossovers, last time I was on one of the desert lands, I almost expected to see huge-ass cables and glowing white towers everywhere...</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that would be bad</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, I'm glad that the internet is making it to an alternate earth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Helps with the reading.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: actually... I think when we access the "normal" net, we might actually be accessing the net of an alternate-timeline Earth, one where Sbarg was never a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: since I've been able to watch all my favorite youtube channels just fine after entry, and they've updated just as they always have been</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: idk, just a theory. I'm full of those today, apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: that would explain how TF2 still works</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Steam.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, if thats the way its going, I guess we are gonna have to wait for a movie to get on nexflix or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or use captcharoid on the box art.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which works fantastically.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What balance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There is this gold paint... that gives gold grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So Its not just artifact.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wouldent that just make Jack mad?</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Sj wants a portal to some cow place</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 0CIUXjp!</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: FL try making a time Tunnle</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((also if we're canon-welding Replay Value into Sbarg, don't forget there's another more benign "glitch" portal type, the Skaian Magicant))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: it should be cheeper</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it needs a regular portal &amp;&amp; a leg of some sort.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It follows a similar pattern to the one from futurama.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cow leg, to be specific.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ...wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, think you could extract the blue from a blue portal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: quck comeone find a pic of a cow then capacaroid it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: we can still access Non-Sbarg-Timeline-Earth's internet, go google image search one</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: wouldent it be a collorless portal than&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I dont want a cow in my house</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I will never get it down the stairs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, while making the long fall boots, I also made the code for the dual portal device.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: but then you would need portal surfaces</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: s3tSztWo</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, the walls of the houses... kinda work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It costs a ton of grist, but its affordable now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: if this game has a bit of Source Engine code in it, assume that metal-class surfaces are portalproof and anything else flat and large enough can be portaled</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: my house has siding</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Interior.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and my house isn't getting siding when building up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: meh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, it would help for climbing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I wonder what the 4th gate will do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe the exact same as the third?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean second?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: posebly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except backwards?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, first person who contacts you is bootstrapped into your 4th gate leading there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: how could that be backward</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: hmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I hope TT contacts me first</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I see two possibilities: either it does the "last person you chatted to" thing (we gotta prioiritize connecting to people who are away from the main group), or it links to whoever's second gate leads to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, if I were to contact someone on the main chain...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: traversing the AE net is time consuming</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, lots of people's second gate lead to TT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ...wait. FUCK. what about those who have multiple inbound Gate 2s, like AE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: mine leads to SJ's</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: nothing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I figure it would be easier for the guardian to do the a person contacts you becomes your 4th gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: RS never linked their Second Gate to anyone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you forgot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not on the chart yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...SV!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When are you gonna update the chart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: NN made it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I thought SV did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I maintain a chart yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Update as in what, and why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He raged at me when I used bubbl.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Is the first gate open?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not the fourth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((You do know that was out of character))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, update the one with second gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It was? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((Yes. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( oh... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: What must be updated then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Disregard that, then. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((though NN's list is IC for some reason))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, RS goes to TT...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Added.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: may i have a link?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, what is the most recent chart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...kinda wish it auto updated...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV:  <a href='http://i.imgur.com/QeMC958.jpg'>http://i.imgur.com/QeMC958.jpg</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((NN's gdocs and the chart and stuff are IC because we'd have to have SOME method of keeping things organized in just a large, weird session))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, may wanna update with everyone's aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: What aspect? </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((That never existed ic))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, heart for me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((I mentioned this like 20 times ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((shrug))</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((I was afk, had to get the mail))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( The IN CANON aspects. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( From the entry codes. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((I know. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((I_KNOW_))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lag? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((could ask about it even if the ooc ones weren't there))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((Oops, you are right. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( To FL, the OOC ones aren't there. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I'll do that later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suppose the same time we get the fourth gates?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((I hope you don't have hard feelings to me FL. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Its okay. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I was worried that you were going to blow up))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((Good. I didn't want anyone to explode))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We also may wanna update... who is still alive...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: That I have already added.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: SV why is this also a shiping chart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: It started out as a joke really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Everyone &lt;3&lt; FI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: + some people here tend to d'aww over the ships.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: so much ships.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Also I dont think I am a Lord outside of the hotel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Expecially the guardian.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh wait thats the other way around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((I'll be doing a rework of the entire megamap after my exams next week. this one will include land names and look sexier in general ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((+ more organised. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((ok))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and I am a prospit dreamer</span><br />
