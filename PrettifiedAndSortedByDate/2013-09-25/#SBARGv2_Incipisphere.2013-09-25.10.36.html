<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. ~ath may be shithive-maggots in its logic, but at least it's easily human-readable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Its logic makes more and more sense the less you expect it to and just go with it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I look away for 5 minutes and what ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Happy birthday, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Some guy opened a portal and my arm got caught in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ouch</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: It's fine now.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nooo thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Were you good at Hide and Go Seek when you were little?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, Skaian Gates, and anything using their base code (like my Brush Portals) are hardwired to prevent Portal Cuts, so unless it was a different type of portal, that shouldn't have happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: It was a different type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: Okay, two things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: 1. Happy birthday!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa7f">CCC: 2. THEY DID WHAT TO ASH?!</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you could always jump ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but that seems wrong and down-right disrespectful. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'd know more about Exseize if my glorious leader was ever around, but hey, Normandy doesn't suck.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, the people I would vote for at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And those people are Kimura and Niki.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So I should come up with a third person… hmmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And yes, I am letting my emotions into who I am voting for.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, I have to do that too (though I'm terrrible at picking out specific people to throw them into quite possibly the worst job in paradox space) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: then make the third one the token logical decision fl</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And yeah, it was, SJ! :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … it got the shit wrecked out of it, though :\</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Honestly, right now, I believe that a leader would need to be open to reason and not fixate on a decision, forcing it upon others even though facts that are brought up may go against it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i honestly think the leader should be more of a figurehead/moral leader</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That rules out the majority of the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: since frankly were doing just fine with no leader at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But then again, it seems you have already accepted Ash as leader, so why not make it official.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Also, nice to see you again, El! :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Hello! C:</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDD</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: soooooooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How have you been lately?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I've been alright! I got bummed for a short bit since I missed Kat's birthday and only realized that now .n. </span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … aw :&lt; Well, time has no real meaning inside the Medium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm sure you could do something a bit late! :)</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's the thought that counts, or something like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yeah, exactly. It's tough to correctly tell time, when there isnt a real sun to orbit around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I'm making something for her right now!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably why most of us still have computer clocks set to our old timezones...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Totally living in AFK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Only rule: five o' clock is tea time. And it's /always/ five somewhere. Also numbers aren't real.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then half of my land isn't real??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Not if it's in AFK time!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CWD</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#145a09">CTS: Niki, you should go to bed soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, it's only almost 11pm ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I stay up way later than that' ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: It's like 2 am here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: from your old time zone? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Oh yeah, my time's still localized to a now inexistant eastern timezone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: tends to happen. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: :)</span><br />
<span style="color:#145a09">CTS: Anyways, you're going to need rest if you're going to get up extra early for training!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: WHAT?! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do I seriously have to go through boot camp AGAIN? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#145a09">CTS: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: @ ______@ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: SJ does have a point... I mean, they are fairly prepared for 'most' dangers that come their way, by now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: They do need more training in various areas... but I question if boot-camp level training is all that nessicary.</span><br />
<span style="color:#145a09">CTS: She will thank me when we're through with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Fair enough, I suppose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, for letting it have an ending in the first place! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#145a09">CTS: Niki, go to bed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...fiiiiine. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Goodnight guys. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: 'Night then.</span><br />
