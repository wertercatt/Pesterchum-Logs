<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I know a space player as well, she's offline at the moment though</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I fear the worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: worst*</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: We've had a few incidents on mine. Someone freaked out over the prototyping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I prototyped my grandpa and a perfectly generic object.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm... If I had the right modus, I might be able to take the denizen to the veil.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Well the one that had the freakout prototype their cat. Their still alive cat. So she may have panicked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: That might work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, not even the wallet modus can hold that much... I might need something better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I'm using a yugioh modus and it managed to caphc. a planet with no problems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I think any modus can capch. a planet if you get a space player to shrink it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right. but Im talking at normal size.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: But since you have a time player here, you only need a space player willing to help and then it's done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Well...I guess it can't hurt to try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: You'll need a space player to enter the planet or get anything from it, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Didn't I already mention taking the entire planet would cause a paradox?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I FELT it get destroyed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I had just made it on my quest bed for gods sake.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: it's time stuff. I'm not sure how it works but sometimes you don't create a paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: It's true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Still...it's hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: like maybe you can get your planet from another timeline?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: And screw over your other self?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if we could somehow simulate the destruction of the planet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: this isn't really my business but I like to butt in on other players and their plans, haha</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, only blow up the section with the quest bed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: See, good idea. That could work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That //might// work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: First of all you still need a space player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: ...Ok I'll just sit here and roll with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Where to get a space player...if your friend doesn't answer anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right. My main plan is to evacuate the residents of the land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if possible, save the rest of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Evacuate them to where though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the veil looks like its big enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: ..True. But where in the veil would you keep them? </span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: There are other things out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plenty of meteors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, it had to make a ring around all the lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we have well over enough room... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Just got to watch out for potential threats is all then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The horror terrors are our friends! What could go wrong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: ...Just be careful. </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except for then lying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: them*</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Keep your eyes open is all I'm saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: They've been really quiet. It's making me nervous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure that its a manner of timing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: Well a spacefrog was recently killed. Maybe that affects them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: Also they have already sent out a coded message of when the next "event" will be...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it was a universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: They told us to do it though. You think they would of warned us if it would cut out transmissions</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Where'd you find that message?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it should be about 7 on my watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: on another memo, some smart ass decoded it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: top images here.</span><br />

<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: it's in two hours.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, est.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 hours for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since I lived in minnesota before all of THIS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Wait. Minnesota? Dude I lived like one state over!</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: A MEETING THAT WAS NEVER MEANT TO HAPPEN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Look at it this way. If we put all the consorts on the meteors, it will be easier to repopulate the earth if we fail.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: &gt;repopulate the earth with consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: If we fail, won't the earth be gone anyways? Or did I misinterpret that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just gonna be wiped out by meteors!</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: I meant wouldn't it be completely gone if our session is lost?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its not like we are a doomed offshoot yet!</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: "YET."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are still the alpha time line.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Are you sure about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Time player sense tingling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I think we are at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...crap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: Let's not think about time things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: I haven't run into any alternate mes YET.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Wait. Maybe I did. Shit I can't remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Things have been fuzzy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, that might be because we haven't all died yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Who even knows anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I just kind of try to not think too hard about those things and focus on what's actually the current situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I still fear the day when a past or future me will pester me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Good for morale. Not so much for potential situations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: I may have a hand in that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Just sayin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to be careful about how we go about this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Exactly. We don't want to doom ourselves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: That screws up the timeline so much. It's every time player's worst nightmare.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: *timelines</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember, don't make eye contact, stay out of sight of our past selves, and what ever you do, DON'T START TALKING TO HIM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: All I'm saying is that's out of my sylphy reach</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: Can't help you there</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: none o' my business</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats what I've learned from all the time travel movies, and it should work for us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: I should be fine. I need to know what went wrong so I kinda HAVE to talk to them. Time player perks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: They are awesome..</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Even though it's sometimes traumatising :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, I first headed out... oh god, I realized we can't even tell direction in the medium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, I remember heading straight out from my ground floor front door.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Damn that's right. I'd say attempt to find landmarks...except they're all moving.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I recomend we come toward it from the opposite direction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: That'd be logical.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we have one landmark thats universal between the lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Point. So CL any input?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And skaia... its kinda like the sun, but its always above the gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: just a sec...</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: multitasking sylp right here yo</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: sylpH</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Still...be careful man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: ^FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: okay so</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Yeah? Spill it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I still thing having a space player assisting you would help a lot. Even if shrinking the planet is out of quetion, you could just as well  have him/her shrink them and place them on something else for the time being.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm... relocate the house?</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: Basically a time and space player combination can help on all practical issues</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: True that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we could always go back multiple times...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: We are THE combination.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Dude. Are you trying to drive me insane?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Timeline stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Always sucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Take it from me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...we should use a mind plzyer to help us know where I went.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Good luck finding one. I haven't seen or met any.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And when.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: THAT TOO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: Hell we could just use a Seer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, if we go back far enough, we can evac most of the consorts before I enter the planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then slowly follow behind myself and get the rest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: I guess so?? I mean, what would you do then once you've gone back? It seems the game tries its best to kill any players who have gone back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Only ones that would change anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The fact is, we go back and evac the consorts I never saw.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thus, no paradox on my side.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: You hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time isn't really my domain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Funny, the aspects tend to grow on you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a41bd">CUE: That is awesome. I just slow them down or speed myself up. Or both. It's really fun.</span><br />
