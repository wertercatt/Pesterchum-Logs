[18:31:43] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#dd1073">CAR</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 LOEAS.</span><br />
[18:32:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  connects to remote port --</span><br />
[18:32:39] <span style="color:#000000">CAR</span> made <span style="color:#000000">AG</span> an OP.<br />
[18:34:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  is now on Gambit's moble computing device --</span><br />
[18:36:44] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  looks at Fracktail --</span><br />
[18:36:58] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Fracktail is the most awesome thing ever</span><br />
[18:38:09] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[18:38:09] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals in, Issun riding on his hat --</span><br />
[18:38:34] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[18:38:34] The Land of Electricity and Shadows has tall electrical towers all across the surface, lightning coursing up and down them, small sparks flying off. In the centre of one of the few ones that remain active, an amount of computers that can only be described as a "metric fuckton" line the walls. A giant robotic dragon is curled in the centre of it, easily recognisable as Fracktail. An alchemiter rests in one corner.<br />
[18:38:47] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT issunJar [CIJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[18:38:47] <span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: ...Whoa. So this is the robot dragon you mentioned.</span><br />
[18:39:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is currently draped in the air near Fracktail but turns to wave at CP and Issun*</span><br />
[18:39:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Issun, right? Meet Fracktail. Fracktail, meet Issun!</span><br />
[18:39:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT issunJar <span style="color:#39b873">[CIJ]</span>  waves, though it's barely visible at his tiny size --</span><br />
[18:40:15] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Fracktail, remeber me I was part of the WolfPack that drove that virus out of you</span><br />
[18:40:59] The dragon turns his head to regard the computer screen AR is manifesting on. "I do," he rumbles.<br />
[18:41:28] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: how are you doing fracktail?</span><br />
[18:41:46] "It's much easier to think now. Thank you and the pack for that."<br />
[18:42:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We're working on getting him to be a summon!</span><br />
[18:47:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool</span><br />
[18:48:09] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: thats sounds like fun</span><br />
[18:49:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yep. RD's back on the Giger, but RB and Gilgamesh are in my deck. They get along with Fracktail here pretty well!</span><br />
[18:50:27] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Oh, PK made a robot body for AIS</span><br />
[18:50:36] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: *AIs</span><br />
[18:50:42] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Im so gonna jack it</span><br />
[18:51:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Cool! What's it like?</span><br />
[18:51:29] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT issunJar <span style="color:#39b873">[CIJ]</span>  just continues boggling vacantly at the size of this guy --</span><br />
[18:51:38] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: basic human</span><br />
[18:51:43] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: but with the best power evah</span><br />
[18:51:55] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Form change</span><br />
[18:52:47] Alice, who's manifested herself on a different screen of the computer bank, smiles at that. "Unlimited forms, or which ones?"<br />
[18:53:03] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  suddenly a rocket boat flies down --</span><br />
[18:53:18] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Unlimited</span><br />
[18:53:32] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: That guy has a talent, i have to admit</span><br />
[18:53:55] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: although he hasnt gotten it pourlly unlimited, it now takes like 20 mana power to formchange</span><br />
[18:54:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  BECOMES WOLF CaFaI --</span><br />
[18:54:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  cimbs on Fracktail because fun --</span><br />
[18:54:15] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: I was unaware robots had mana. Hm.</span><br />
[18:54:35] The robotic dragon is used to someone being all over him by now and so barely bats an eye.<br />
[18:55:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  gets on fracktail's head --</span><br />
[18:56:04] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: :P</span><br />
[18:57:33] <span style="color:#000000">CFT: "Hello there."</span><br />
[18:57:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sits off to the site, checking something on a vidwindow --</span><br />
[18:57:58] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Your really big</span><br />
[18:59:26] FT: "Yes."<br />
[18:59:51] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: how did you get into that dungeon?</span><br />
[19:01:28] FT: "I don't know. I got out by vaporising the roof."<br />
[19:02:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the way I understand it, you were probably spawned in the dungeon when we went in...</span><br />
[19:04:16] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: I think powerkittens the reason you were the chosen boss</span><br />
[19:04:30] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He wound up totally not being a boss, though.</span><br />
[19:04:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's like the second dungeon in a row.</span><br />
[19:04:57] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: he feels really guilty the way he killed you in the game</span><br />
[19:05:05] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: ??</span><br />
[19:05:16] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: Ag what?</span><br />
[19:05:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Heeey, shoosh! Don't talk about things like that! *frowns at AR*</span><br />
[19:05:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And there was a robot dinosaur miniboss in SJ's dungeon, remember?</span><br />
[19:05:43] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: that didnt bossy up</span><br />
[19:06:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Fracktail didn't turn out to be a boss either.</span><br />
[19:06:36] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: ((Seriously though thats why fracktail was in the dungeon. I still feel so guilty about killing him in super paper mario ))</span><br />
[19:07:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I think most players do ;'( ))</span><br />
[19:08:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( my dragon friend DDD: not for killing!!! ))</span><br />
[19:08:51] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: I made a piratepad</span><br />
[19:09:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: â€¦ okay?</span><br />
[19:09:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's a common thing around here.</span><br />
[19:09:12] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: (( thats like the worst thing ive ever done in a video game))</span><br />
[19:09:19] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: For sharing capchacodes</span><br />
[19:09:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, there's definitely one of those around.</span><br />
[19:09:45] <span style="color:#dd1073">CAR: oh really</span><br />
[19:09:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT autokittenResponder <span style="color:#dd1073">[CAR]</span>  fails originality --</span><br />
