[07:49:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: So how's your life been going?</span><br />
[07:49:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: too exciting already</span><br />
[07:50:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'm /trying/ to calm down.</span><br />
[07:50:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: You can never have a life that's "too exciting", dude.</span><br />
[07:50:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Eeever.</span><br />
[07:51:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'm trying to make friends with an imp right now, so....</span><br />
[07:52:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: â€¦ imps are occasionally cute and-- OH IS IT SCRABBLE/</span><br />
[07:52:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: *? Scrabble is cute.</span><br />
[07:52:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: I like him.</span><br />
[07:52:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: yes its scrabble</span><br />
[07:55:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Also! Other question. Should your clones be using your weapons and whatnot?</span><br />
[07:55:34] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Like can they access your Sylladex?</span><br />
[07:55:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: no, they don't have /my/ weapons</span><br />
[07:55:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: they might have imitations though</span><br />
[07:57:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Aaahhh...</span><br />
[07:57:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Okay, so I'm not insane.</span><br />
[07:57:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: but nothing at the level of my top tier weapons I think.</span><br />
[07:57:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I mean, Dolos wouldn't spend that much time on them, right?</span><br />
[07:57:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Either way, they're still susceptible to certain things.</span><br />
[07:58:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: And by certain things I mean being fought down to the ground and having knives stabbed through them in order to /keep/ them on the ground before slowly carved to bits.</span><br />
[07:58:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
