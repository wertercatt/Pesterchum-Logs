[07:57:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how many afterlifes are just a black void of nothingness?</span><br />

[07:58:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably because you had unfinished business, or didn't do anything to earn it.</span><br />
[07:58:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you just haven't ~believed~!</span><br />

[07:59:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it was an accident, I didn't know that the trees would kill her when I burnt them.</span><br />
[07:59:47] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: good job nerdlord</span><br />
[07:59:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe that's why you're not going to an afterlife.</span><br />
[07:59:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (well I didn't expect my skull to be shattered by a tree branch either)</span><br />

[08:02:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or I could finish the soulbots.</span><br />

[08:03:40] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: and make a golem</span><br />
[08:03:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
[08:03:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because I can't replicate magic.</span><br />

[08:07:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Elsey, I'm sorry I killed your mom. I know a simple sorry doesn't solve it... but I can't fix it either, since I doubt anyone wants me to try.</span><br />
[08:07:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Literally nobody wants you to try I'd bet.</span><br />
[08:07:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: See I kinda left the planet so I could avoid death through stupidity.</span><br />

[08:11:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS NOT A GAME ANYMORE</span><br />
[08:11:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: didn't know there was supposed to be a post-game storyline. ➜</span><br />
[08:12:07] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: well it's probably really rad whatever he or she is doing</span><br />
[08:12:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...it never was a game in the first place.</span><br />
[08:12:12] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: YΘU'LL ΘNLY BUMP THAT CH▲NCE UP TΘ 9000%</span><br />
[08:12:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if I do it on another planet?</span><br />
[08:12:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Will that lower the chance?</span><br />
[08:12:41] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘ.</span><br />
[08:12:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's definitely really rad, and it's definitely still part game at least.</span><br />
[08:13:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, there's a million planets of lore.</span><br />
[08:13:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: MOST righteous, brotha.</span><br />
[08:13:17] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: or maybe it's just happenstance that you're finding all this rad stuff and it's not even game stuff</span><br />
[08:13:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if I have a light player on my side?</span><br />
[08:13:22] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: that would be like. even cooler.</span><br />
[08:13:44] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘPE</span><br />
[08:13:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And not bother using my luck stat at all?</span><br />
[08:13:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since its completely and utterly broken</span><br />
[08:14:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe I'm just a super nice guy and I've been mistaking this stuff for game stuff this entire time.</span><br />

[08:14:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (Which would explain it breaking)</span><br />
[08:15:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: psychologically*</span><br />
[08:15:15] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: i dunno, maybe it's just the way you hung out with that frog</span><br />

[08:15:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so one of the frogs made it so Crows are constantly pecking at my eyes?</span><br />

[08:16:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I left the planet!</span><br />
[08:16:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been to two others!</span><br />
[08:17:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And both of the consort moons!</span><br />
[08:17:23] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good for you!</span><br />
[08:17:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I tried to kickstart the space mission and it still hasn't done much. ➜</span><br />

[08:18:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heck, we don't even have space pens yet. ➜</span><br />
[08:18:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Doubt that's even possible against a Space hero.</span><br />
[08:18:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gotta speed up</span><br />

[08:19:03] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: the lead gets stuck in important equipment</span><br />
[08:19:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've never found a use for it, but it's hilarious.</span><br />
[08:19:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *graphite ➜</span><br />
[08:19:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I've also been to the edge of the universe, which seems to be the error handling of attempting to flare back to a location back in the session.</span><br />

[08:19:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course I don't go there anymore.</span><br />

[08:19:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[08:19:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not since I droped that... /thing/ off there.</span><br />

[08:19:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Meanwhile, you guys have seriously never seen a boss?</span><br />

[08:20:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope.</span><br />
[08:20:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow, that's kind of impressive.</span><br />
[08:20:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're a pretty crazy bunch.</span><br />
[08:21:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have 12 "minibosses" in my mountain. At least, I think that was part of the plot of my land quests.</span><br />
[08:21:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: lol</span><br />
[08:22:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: 12 in a mountain</span><br />
[08:22:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so that's what those snake consorts actually are?</span><br />
[08:22:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, they were actually experements.</span><br />
[08:22:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember Dolos?</span><br />
[08:22:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember hearing about that guy ➜</span><br />
[08:22:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: vaguely remember him as well</span><br />
[08:23:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, lets just say there was enough consort in those hybrids to actually get past the door. Not very powerful, but they are quite intelegent.</span><br />
[08:23:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And they can shapeshift, which you all know.</span><br />
[08:24:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sounds incredibly lame.</span><br />
[08:24:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well I mean, sorta cool.</span><br />
[08:24:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I suppose that makes sense.</span><br />
[08:24:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They are like... mini denizens I guess.</span><br />
[08:25:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the mini kraid in Super Metroid if you played it.</span><br />
[08:25:20] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: how's things on the ship, SJ?</span><br />
[08:25:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some of the ones out here are as tough or tougher than players</span><br />
[08:25:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright up here, same as usual ➜</span><br />
[08:25:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, players right now.</span><br />
[08:26:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa ➜</span><br />
[08:26:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some DBZ-tier fights compared to some mini-denizen consort things.</span><br />
[08:26:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I just like breaking Charles' balls it ain't a real pissing contest though.</span><br />
[08:27:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I've had to prevent them from making fusion reactors /twice/.</span><br />
[08:27:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but is there like, reasons to fight these bosses out there? ➜</span><br />
[08:27:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[08:27:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes, yeah.</span><br />
[08:27:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah why don't you just tavros mode the bosses</span><br />
[08:28:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes it's to gain a new move or a weapon, but sometimes they want to destroy the world or something.</span><br />
[08:28:23] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or they're doing some seriously bad things and it requires some mad player-power to stop.</span><br />
[08:28:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The most recent one was toppling the Clockwork Regime by beating their boss.</span><br />
[08:29:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my plan to deal with a galactic empire is to throw Super Obama at them.</span><br />
[08:29:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then give him Obamanite so he Mega Evolves? <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
[08:30:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But he has the chaos emeralds.</span><br />
[08:30:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That sounds like a really, really bad plan! But you're probably used to those.</span><br />
[08:30:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I guess we could get the super emeralds in the mix.</span><br />
[08:30:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if we ever find that guy again. ➜</span><br />
[08:30:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man that one was so rough I almost considered asking Rob for help.</span><br />
[08:30:33] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Where is he anyway?</span><br />
[08:30:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: turn him into Hyper Obama.</span><br />
[08:30:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he pops up every once in a while...</span><br />
[08:30:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure at the moment ➜</span><br />
[08:31:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But he's still alive, right?</span><br />
[08:32:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a guy like RS doesn't die so easily. ➜</span><br />
[08:32:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS is with us</span><br />
[08:32:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course he doesn't, he's a real man.</span><br />
[08:32:31] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu.</span><br />
[08:32:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Real men never die.</span><br />
[08:32:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On the other end of the planet</span><br />
[08:32:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well yeah I bet he's crying about Kat.</span><br />
[08:33:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: hey FL if you let me in i promise not to beat the crap out of you</span><br />
[08:33:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if I don't let you in</span><br />
[08:33:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what will you do then</span><br />
[08:33:47] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: then i'll beat the crap out of you</span><br />
[08:33:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously I can see a trick when its there.</span><br />
[08:34:03] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: what trick</span><br />
[08:34:07] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: i just want to talk about life</span><br />
[08:34:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Isaac, you will be the crap out of me regardless of my choice.</span><br />
[08:34:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: beat*</span><br />
[08:34:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Honestly, you probably have it coming.</span><br />
[08:34:34] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: so what's the harm in letting me in if you know i'm gonna get in anyways</span><br />
[08:34:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I don't even know who this Isaac guy is</span><br />
[08:34:40] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: might as well appease me, hm?</span><br />
[08:34:46] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh, just a drifter</span><br />
[08:34:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Drifted to the wrong neighborhood, mate.</span><br />
[08:35:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: I can tell.</span><br />
[08:35:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually it didn't used to be so bad, there were some genuinely awesome people.</span><br />
[08:35:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hes a dude from another universe that has managed to turn up as a roleplay on Beta Earths Internet.</span><br />
[08:35:33] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then the game ended and everybody either left, died, or became Charles.</span><br />
[08:35:45] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: you wot mate</span><br />
[08:36:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Other universes?</span><br />
[08:36:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: i bet you're some dingy-ass porno mag character if that's the case</span><br />
[08:36:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I haven't even touched those yet, except that one.</span><br />
[08:36:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So where does that put SJ and Kimura?</span><br />
[08:36:30] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: kimura? fetish porn</span><br />
[08:36:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[08:36:38] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: not sure about SJ</span><br />
[08:36:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .</span><br />
[08:36:56] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: i calls 'em as i sees 'em</span><br />
[08:36:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Solo stuff, probably.</span><br />

[08:37:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:37:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man, I forgot how much I hated the cold.</span><br />
[08:38:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fuck I can't do a directed facepalm.</span><br />
[08:41:28] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: then let me in, nerdling</span><br />
[08:41:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ever been on a planet that doesn't rotate?</span><br />
[08:41:28] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: nah</span><br />
[08:41:28] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: must be real disorienting</span><br />
[08:41:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah it seriously is.</span><br />
[08:41:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Question.</span><br />
[08:41:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did the Sun orbit the planet?</span><br />
[08:42:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, it's in your usual solar system.</span><br />
[08:42:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It orbits, but it doesn't rotate, it just drifts.</span><br />
[08:42:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
[08:42:17] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's apparently the curse.</span><br />
[08:42:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tell me when you find a planet that a star orbits on the opposing side of the moon.</span><br />
[08:42:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or if you find a flat planet.</span><br />
[08:43:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Can't say I've seen one of those yet.</span><br />
[08:43:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, tell me if you find a flat planet.</span><br />
[08:43:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'm on the trail of a CRAY CRAY tough boss.</span><br />
[08:43:44] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: hey, can you take me with</span><br />
[08:43:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think I've /heard/ of them, but you'd never get to one.</span><br />
[08:43:48] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: sounds like a neat boss fight</span><br />
[08:43:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you think you might need some help over there? ➜</span><br />
[08:44:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
[08:44:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's going on?</span><br />
[08:44:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Y'know, I might need some help in a bit.</span><br />
[08:44:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'll do the boring traveling stuff, it's cold as hell here.</span><br />
[08:45:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm looking for a specific gravestone on a PLANET of graves.</span><br />
[08:45:22] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Seymour Wie-- this isn't even a real person, who made this gravestone!</span><br />
