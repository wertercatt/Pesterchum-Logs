[10:24:11] <span style="color:#000000">CCC</span> took away <span style="color:#0080ff">FL</span>'s OP powers.<br />
[12:01:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey Kimura.</span><br />
[12:01:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:01:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
[12:06:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to think of an AU that would be... easier to make it through.</span><br />
[12:12:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_pkOgunCSY'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_pkOgunCSY</a> &gt;:?</span><br />
[12:17:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ummm</span><br />
[12:17:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what is that</span><br />
[12:24:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugging intensifies? --</span><br />
[12:37:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :o</span><br />
[12:37:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: o_O</span><br />
[12:38:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeeeeaaaah, I mostly suggested it for the ironies.</span><br />
[12:41:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Any serious suggestions?</span><br />
[12:43:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe... Mario Party?</span><br />
[12:43:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, remember that time a Game Cube dropped on my land and we got stuck in my custom MP8.5 board...</span><br />
[12:44:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically that, but without the risk of nullification</span><br />
[12:45:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait, that would have happened if we lost?</span><br />
[12:46:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (@_@)</span><br />
[12:47:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...you haven't watched ReBoot, have you.</span><br />
[12:47:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, sorry.</span><br />
[12:51:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/rebootabridgedseries/videos?flow=grid&view=0'>https://www.youtube.com/user/rebootabridgedseries/videos?flow=grid&view=0</a> <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/liloandstitch_educateyourself.gif'>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/liloandstitch_educateyourself.gif</a></span><br />
[12:51:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (you might have to scroll a bit to find the early episodes, he uploaded them way out of order)</span><br />
[12:59:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should I be watching the abridged version?</span><br />
[01:01:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, shrug. I'm too lazy to look up the unabridged right now :P</span><br />
[01:02:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suddenly understand nothing and everything.</span><br />
[01:05:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( wait you love and hate fries at the same time? ))</span><br />
[01:06:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that's Despairstuck!Kimura only, and blame Monokuma.))</span><br />
[01:09:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, So I know an AU we could do.</span><br />
[01:09:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It wouldn't give any advantages for later AU's though, but it might help out.</span><br />
[01:09:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, he made a joke at a camera, Monokuma came out and dumped fries in his pants, the bear now ships Kim&lt;3Fries OTP, and Kim himself just wants to get out of that cargo ship))</span><br />
[01:09:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what is it?</span><br />
[01:10:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uplink.</span><br />
[01:10:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that's true...</span><br />
[01:10:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hopefully near the end, and with as many people as possible.</span><br />
[01:10:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since we won't get any advantages, nor will we be able to use any.</span><br />
[01:10:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I assume with us on the "stopping Revelation" side...</span><br />
[01:11:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, unless we do a successful Battle Network or Digimon AU.</span><br />
[01:11:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we... probably shouldn't touch either. considering that merged AU you got locked in last time.</span><br />
[01:11:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right.</span><br />
[01:12:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about a Minecraft AU?</span><br />
[01:12:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I'm so sure about the ending point, but it could give us an advantage.</span><br />
[01:13:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And it would give me an excuse to run a survival server with a mission. ))</span><br />
[01:13:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( :O ))</span><br />
[01:13:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I'll be sneaking some written books in. ))</span><br />
[01:14:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, I could actually pull off a merged AU and get it done faster...</span><br />
[01:16:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I forget, what's the point of finishing AUs again?</span><br />
[01:16:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In order for us to locate where the viral entity is within the AU Machine so we may take it out.</span><br />
[01:17:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, didn't know it was a legit virus.</span><br />
[01:17:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: --in which case, I wonder about a Code Lyoko AU...</span><br />
[01:18:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: assuming the virus is an AI and actively partitipating in sims, it'd be forced into the role of X.A.N.A....</span><br />
[01:21:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then we just go explore Replikas and download its code directly from the Towers.</span><br />
[01:22:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, unless it runs revelation on Lyoko.</span><br />
[01:22:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fuck.</span><br />
[01:23:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, Uplink probably /would/ be safer. even if no matter what AU we do, we're never at risk of real-world bodily harm...</span><br />
[01:26:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, should we try to pull off a merged AU?</span><br />
[01:27:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: merging which things again?</span><br />
[01:27:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Homestuck and Minecraft.</span><br />
[01:27:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...yeah, I guess.</span><br />
[01:27:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Alright, now I have a map to load at least. ))</span><br />
[01:27:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Should I bring up the server now or wait for more people? ))</span><br />
[01:28:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((SburbCraft? and do it later.))</span><br />
[01:28:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Yeah, SBURBCraft. ))</span><br />
[01:28:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((as in not-this-week later, but put it on the schedule pad for a saturday probably))</span><br />
[01:31:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Haha!</span><br />
[01:32:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know how I said that an AU would be unsuccessful if all players were to die when in the AU?</span><br />
[01:32:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
[01:33:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, due to the way Minecraft works, I've managed to hack together a "respawn" setting. As long as we don't all die at once, We should be able to continue.</span><br />
[01:34:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool.</span><br />
[01:35:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There /might/ be some delay before you respawn...</span><br />
[01:38:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Now to find a server plugin that allows for spawn delay... ))</span><br />
