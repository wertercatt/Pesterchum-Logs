DL: Question: do you lot use the Replay AU mechanics here?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some people use them</span><br />
DL: Just wondering. I saw references to it, so.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We tend to mix and match some... I tend to use the blender thing when It comes to alchemized food.</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span> depends on your personal preference</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: when it's convenient to, I guess. mostly the bits that have become part of the common headcanon, like the term "Dwelling Spire" and some other stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We have also used the OHGODWHAT and Skaian Magicant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>My mom is screaming.<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also those :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aw, what's going on MG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We also have the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>, Chronos Glitch Clones and Stuff from movies and games showing up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the Code room in Prospit is from Wreck it Ralph.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and the fact that he Jurassic Parked the game code by taking things from everything... kind of like what we're doing, now that I think about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, FL has the Golden Sword from A Link to the Past, and is going to upgrade it again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even though that WAS the final upgrade in the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm just wondering, was it ever stated in v2 canon that other game code chunks were crammed into it anywhere?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been sorta confused by that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not exactly in canon as far as the tumblr is concerned...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Semi Canon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it was an explanation I came up with a while ago for why so much of our stuff is ripoffs of other games, and it kinda stuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I tend to base it on a glitch that the game spawns objects as soon as you enter, and the list of objects is glitched into the alchemized objects as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though the <span style="color:#ff00ff">Pink Sun</span> is canon, Fake-FG actually replied to my ask mentioning it</span><br />
DL: Though couldn't you just alchemise, say, video games you brought in with something?<br />
DL: That would create the ripoff items, I think.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, which is Why I think its a spawning bug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its naturally spawning objects that SHOULD be Alchemized.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>...<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>I've been missing so much.<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>They apparently shipped my computer to my house today at 9am while I was asleep.<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>Nobody was awake to sign for it.<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>They said it wouldn't ship until the 17th and then they said it would be longer than that.<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>Then it shows up at the door a day later? Lolwut?<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
<span style="color:#00c9fc">CMG: <span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! </span>I hope it is fixed. :&lt;<span style="color:#fc31fa"> ! :D </span></span><br />
