<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I sent deadPool after chronos. If the universe starts to fall apart, GO BACK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so that's why</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Great, is space time already falling apart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except for around dead pool?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, I've been trying to get back into the groove lately.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Everything seems good so far...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe deadpool just went "screw it" and left?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I find that likely...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other wise there would have been an explosion by now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, I'm wondering what is worse... SCP-682, or chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I just looked that one up and.... wow. ._.;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wonder which one would win in a fight...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, does anyone have a quantum computer to run the simulation on?</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might take a while to get some straight answers from my consorts though</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wat even hapen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh christ there goes the fourth wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Wait a second, does that make that guy... /Ultimate/ Deadpool?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wasn't that the Deadpool nobody liked until Shattered Dimensions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSM: This memo is spiderman now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And that would make /you/ Ultimate Spider-Man...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pff, for all we know, its a future Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time travel makes my head hurt, sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSM: They didn't want me in the avengers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we have enough problems in our session as it is, we don't need the main memo infected by spiderman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSM: I.. *sniff* Baaawhaaaahaha! </span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: drama queen much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...okay he /definitely/ wasn't spider man</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No dead pool, you don't get the memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...unless you get rid of chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He should have just killed Gwen Stacy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: from his... god dammit I hate timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's not for everyone. Things seem to get confusing fast, and that's just talking from the perspective of a note reciever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time travel tenses!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I still don't get those very well. :b</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I woin't haive survived.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...now, who wants to play megaman zero 4?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I liked that game better when it was called Zero 3</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And I liked /that/ game better when it was called X5</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I liked Battle Network 3.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well a 'course you did, it was a good game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then they made battle network 4... :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Now if you said you liked Battle Network /4/, well I'd have to wonder if everything's alright in your head</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeeeeeah there it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Battle network 4 SUCKED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny thing, that. The Battle Network games go in cycles, just like the Resident Evil ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Except its a different cycle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, the concept of the dark chips was a bit... entertaining.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SV can tell you that its a logical argument.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As he apparenly is going to die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I never played the battle network games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For Battle Network its rubbish game with some potential waaaay below the surface, greatly improved game maxing on the concepts of the last one, and absolute bully game to peak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Then the cycle repeats</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, 6 was FUN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then they reinvented the wheel with star force.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Battle Network 1 was rubbish no two ways about it. Battle Network 2 was the surprisingly improved sequel, streamlining the internet and navigation, introducing style changes,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 peaked in the story...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Battle Network 3 was the sum cumulation, building on everything to be arguably the best of the trilogy and capping it off</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I always thought that the Cross system in 6 was better than the style system, but thats just me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's my fondest dream that they rerelease the first three battle network games on the 3DS in a compilation, polishing 1 up to par with the last two and linking them such that chips and such carry over, making it into a real complete experience</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also Chaos Unison is OP, nerf plz.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or atleast prevent pausing while charging.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Chaos Unison and the Cross system were OP as /shit/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Beast Out similarly so and Cross Beast just broke the game into tiny little pieces.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cross worked, but it might have been better if you could only have a few crosses at a time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So yeah, that cycle. Battle Network 4 was trash, 5 was surprsingly improved, and 6 was great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Mostly unnecessary but hey Zero 4's much the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, I have a lets play.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://lparchive.org/Mega-Man-Battle-Network-4-6/'>http://lparchive.org/Mega-Man-Battle-Network-4-6/</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I saw that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...course, I overly used game shark in 4, so I didn't have to face the HORRIBLE FREEZE OF DOOM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi FI</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (lol @ my quirk)</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The grinding is horrendous</span><br />
<span style="color:#51c1fc">CMG: ~ I'm not even on my planet right now. Xp ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently, the Wizard is like one of those fortune-tellers in games that tells you what you're supposed to do next if you're lost as fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or at least that's one of his purposes</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh man</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I remember once on the Chumosphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: some guy was raging because he had sent his bedsheets off to be laundered before he entered</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: so his Secret Wizard was dressed in nothing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, to finish my actual land quest, I have to max-level all my brush techniques, and then the final task is-- oh frogs what EU</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: try finding your helper Consort when he's dressed like approximatly 96% of the Land population instead of the unique entity he's supposed to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: --the final task is to go on one more trip around my land, using all 14 abilities to fix everything, finally ending up at the Fahr City Big Bomb Cannon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then after I defeat the denizen, I will get some kinda land instrument I have to play to actually wake the land or something?</span><br />
