[06:18:47] <span style="color:#005400">CSL: or are you doing it out of some sense of honor</span><br />
[06:20:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Honor's got nothing to do with it. I've gotta be /better/ then him, be a better inventor and craftsman then him. That means beating his sword with a better one, of my making.</span><br />
[06:21:06] <span style="color:#005400">CSL: alright i aint questioning your intentions</span><br />

[06:22:36] <span style="color:#005400">CSL: we all have our own journeys</span><br />
[06:23:12] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hehe. Chances are he wouldn't just stand there and take that, he's got a pretty gnarly sword himself. And tons of other stuff up his sleeves, I'm sure.</span><br />
