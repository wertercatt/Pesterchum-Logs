<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: That would... Suck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Observation 16: Penguins are nowhere near as nonthreatening as their demeanor and appearance would suggest</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ha! I know. Only Ducks are deadlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...I hope there are no duck consorts.</span><br />
