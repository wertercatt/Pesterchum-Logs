[07:54:52] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont be scared to be honest either</span><br />
[07:55:01] DS: the fact that at least two people in the room have expressed desire to kill me in the past?<br />

[07:57:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Where in the line of sense and logic does it lie to aim a large laser at a high center of players. Not only do you endanger yourself and others but you may force their hand, if they actually wished to kill you.</span><br />

[08:00:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but the point is we need to think about the fact that we created an atmosphere where the thought of pulling a mutually assured destruction card even came into his head</span><br />
[08:00:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SL.</span><br />
[08:00:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: We've estabilshed that two people have stated their wish to kill them.</span><br />
