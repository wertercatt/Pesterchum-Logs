<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Ohhhh</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SCODE/HAFG wasn't really focussed on Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: tbh he only existed there because one of the GMs who played the first arc's major villain didn't have a computer for when we scheduled the final boss battle</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: and I think Tidebound/iamofcourse is still going</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: and uh then we had to stall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so you ended the session Cascade-style...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … yeah, and then we had wacky adventures (and zetta political intrigue) in the Scratched Session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: LU, if I remember the infopage right, Tidebound became a fanventure instead of an RP</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and then it sorta died kinda? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: SORTA DIED KINDA</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: I have a feeling the battle will be won by unlikely heros</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: All the active people and peeps recognized as leaders'll play second fiddle to some random badass</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … That's exactly how it happened in SCODE, PO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Pffffffft really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: and the badass was AG</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dynast was literally beaten by "The League of Minor Characters".</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: TLoMC</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because the Council and all the "important people" were sheparding everyone out the Wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Actually, LU, I was dead by that point. My somehow-autonomous dreamself Laika was the leader of TLoMC though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Well that's kinda messed up</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: honestly, I wish my character didn't get the Prince class. Not only do I suck as RPing a highly destructive and active class, but it makes me sound like a mary-sue in the context of the session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have never claimed that SCODE was anything but bullshit and more bullshit because we were trying to justify our own bullshit. It was literally a mistake. And… SJ, why didn't you just change your Class?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, it was luck of the draw SJ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Heheheh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: Im kinda annyoed both of my charecters are times</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because I promised to stick with what I got the first time. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Keep it bro</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Knight of Hope was just a lucky draw</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, you might actually /need/ it at some point...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: It seems like mostly everyone here was yelling at me for trying to create it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (also Oculus Rift + porting to C++ = badass VR game)</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: No, brother, we were discussing logistics</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was probably the only one yelling. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: For shaaaaaame</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: Well I mentioned the multiworld bit and it seemed like everyone was like "WHAT, YOU CANT DO THAT"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I think that you're a shitty coder and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the code of a reality-altering Game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And would never put my life/trust in anything you wrote.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...back up the bus, you mentioned what now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what multiworld bit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: The land-gen thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: well I already know AG is agenst me touching computers</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: you can't even /spell/ or write a coherenet, sensible dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: sorry if I don't trust you with what would become the fabric of our reality</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Who can't spell? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's a difference between testing for baby-proofing on an idea and shooting it down ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: Okay The way its set up when I use the grabber to pull the players chareceters to our world, the program is designed to locate their planets and add them to the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: Mike, AG is refering to me obviously</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: and that spelling of "charecters" was shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, my character does NOT want to be stuck in another session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: But in that sentence she had a misspelling. Ironic, ya see? </span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Characters*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. so basically adding lands from the other session, like what Jade did kind of?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: yeah but automated Kimura</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: SJmun its your decession on what charecters to bring with you</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I only have one main. the rest are just accumulated side characters that aren't even players. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: Same here lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ditto</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: its not just specifially players that the grabber brings. The land grab will just skip over the side charecters</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why am I even in this memo still ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... the side chars would just be spontaniously left floating in the medium?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe782b">CPO: For lolz</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also SJ, idk but I'm probably going to bed soon too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: no they would be spawned on the Mun's land</span><br />

<span style="color:#55007f">CLU: *here</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I only came to that conclusion because I wound up making way too many blank retcon papers and his thing about the excuse for DD being killed off, which I'm sure only had the excuse of CCmun wanting to eliminate one of his chars anyways. ➜</span><br />
