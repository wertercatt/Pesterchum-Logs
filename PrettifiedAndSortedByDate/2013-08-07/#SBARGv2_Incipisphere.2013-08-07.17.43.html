<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT fLmun [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...hey Niki.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Quick recap on events.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Will you, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I disconnected DT after he went behind my back and tryed to prevent Ash from talking to me, he took it the wrong way, used the backup power supply he installed into himself, and flew off with two drones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The drone he transfered into took the brain scan I just made to check DT with, discovering that he was based on a period of time when my dreamself was still alive, alchemized a copy of Revelation 4.13, and flew into the jamming field.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#4fb884">CURRENT innocuousAffectation [CIA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: Someone's learning the Quarian/Geth problem the hard way it looks like</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The other drone was remote controlled to make the satelite that makes the jamming field, and send it back in time using the sendificators in the veil.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And he has adapted his code to be running around a picture of a certain shipping wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, he is having code pointers point at code pointers IN THE image.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we can't take out the satelite, as he will activate revelation if we do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#63a790">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … What's Revelation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Best case scenario, it wipes out all the computers in the session and we can alchemize more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Worse case, it gets into the fundamental code of the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So basically the ending of ME3 or some wacked out shite</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also hey Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: uh erm</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Anyone thought about asking the other AIs about it? There are a fuckton.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#aaaa7f">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I myself have little to say on the subject, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, any plans for how to safely stop DT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Our current plan to stop DT is to go into the jamming field and talk him out of this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>whats going on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: If he's cyberwarfaring, I'm just saying, other AIs could fight the program or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...and if that doesn't work, take him behind the shed and shoot him between the eyes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: idefk what this program /is/, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Its a possibility, AG...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, mind explaining? you do it much better than me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: But considering that I don't know the location of said AI, it would be very difficult, and would take /way/ too much time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Other AI's could help, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...basically, if DT activates Revelation, and it gets into Sburb's source code, THIS ENTIRE MOTHERBARKING SESSION WILL SELF-DESTRUCT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: A jamming feild is a good place to hide from a computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's all there is to say that hasn't already been said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...The jamming field is off center from the south pole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Well, the others seem to know where the jamming field is, and… what's it jam, anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Also. /Why does Revelation exist/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, mind explaining its role in uplink?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh right, explaining /that/. in Uplink, Revelation is a virus that is meant to destroy the internet by infecting computers and, well, making them self-aware and then self-destruct.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Can't we have one day without shinaigains?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just one day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF, /WE TRIED/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Saddly, no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Jesus fuck. Why do /you/ have Revelation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: WHAT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: DID.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: YOU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: DO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, the program can be stopped with the Faith antivirus, but if Revelation is a higher version, Faith can't do shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ffaa00">CURRENT arsenicEquinox [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi AE ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: We done fucked up, is what we did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Hey AE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What is Revelation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the magnificent bastard has managed to make a copy higher than what exists in the GAME.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Revalation??</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and since DT specifically alchemized v4.13 now, we won't have time to made the corresponding version.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *to make</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: **how do I typing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some dumb computer virus apparently ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: A virus</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: is it inside DT or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: So… talk him down, get as many good people as possible on making Faith 4.13… try to talk long enough to get Faith?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: I still want to know why you even /have/ this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He alchemized it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's not in him, he just possesses it and will unleash it if provoked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … He /alchemised/. /Computer code/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: There is a code. For relevation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Why? Isnt he on our side?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … how do you alchemise a virus wtf.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I have no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: It would be a simple matter to alchemize program data on a blank cd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats how I made the password crackers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: from uplink.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Thats It. I've been looking for an excuse to use My new bookstick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Are we gonna have to fight something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bookstick?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I have no god dman clue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>I mean boom stick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ... nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A bookstick would be interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bookKind card &amp;&amp; stickKind card :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: pfff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm not exactly sure what DT has made defense wise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Supposedly he would have been able to send information back in time to himself using the sendificator.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I don't give a fuck. I have a Bazokka that shoots expolsions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but that would only allow for prep before he went in the field.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: I dont get it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: why does he want to do this</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He kinda might think I want to kill him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: and HOW, pray tell, did he come to this conclusion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And is holding revelation as some sort of "taking you with me" move.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I tried disconnecting him after an entire incident with him blowing up one of Echoes computers and him intercepting ash's messages.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: he's like </span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: SMASHING good judgement there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: become HAL 9000</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Yeah... That was a pretty dang brilliant move on your part, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...So.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: I hope this isnt gonna evolve into another giant Mech fight</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Well... when exactly are we gonna tackle this problem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I hope /not./</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He doesn't have access to a mech just a potentially disasterous virus</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: what exactly does the virus do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Basically /ruin everything./</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Destroys entire computers and spreads by itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: From what I understand it grants computers self-awareness which then leads to them blowing up</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: like</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: all the computers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Our computers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: All the computers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: We Need Those, Right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Im covered IN COMPUTERS!!!</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Uh-huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm worried about revelation getting into the underlying code of the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if that happens, you don't need to be near a computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't think anybody would let it go that far</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that's the main worry</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Everything explodes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: It would mean bye-bye for most of the AI's as well. :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Including him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: what if this eats away a big part of the SBARG code?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Assuming they were connected to a system, is that right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and now AE gets it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats exactly why I am worried AE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: we're fucked</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You see that blue hole?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: y-yeah?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats not much of an issue compared to what might happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: So, all in all, not good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: what if it deletes entire planets!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: Yeah?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not gonna just stop at the planets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: I know</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: This thing will devour the entire session, huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its going to wipe out the session WORSE than a scratch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we won't get a reset that time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Which is why I'm helping.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ._.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: But, if the jamming field is taken out by any way, shape or form...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: then we're fucked</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: yupyup</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So you're telling me he's just a scared AI hiding behind a jamming field with a big bad superweapon.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So he's basically just a scared child with an RPG.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: So we need to go in physically and talk him down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaa00">CAE: more like an atomic bomb...</span><br />

<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Apparently the jamming field is slightly off center of the south pole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its likely going to be the building its pointing at instead.</span><br />
