<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: Hi</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: I've been trying to code, its hard when you don't know how.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: But I used some of the samples i got from my various sources to make some new sylladux stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: The main thing was a fetch modus, which was also the hardest thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: Also me trying to work on the strife specibus and such</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: I also experimented with some samples I got from an abandonned furthest ring server</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: mostly I destroyed my stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: but i figured out that its possible to tie pretty much ANY kind of code to a specibus and have it do something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: I mean sylladux</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: not specibus</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you're trying to code new fetch modi and specibi? cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: I made a bunch of really abstract ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: Several of which are basically just garbage disposal because they get sent to some other place that i'm not sure of:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: I decided to try and figure out a way to record where they all go</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: and i've narrowed it down to several locations</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: which sadly, are the furthest ring, some kind of glitch, or this wierd other place that I can't really make since of</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: more than likely the glitch it sends them to is the <span style="color:#004dbc">Blue Hole</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: Then I started sending all these cameras there in hopes of trying to make since of it, but its still just a really dark location with the sillouhetteof what I believe to be some kind of horrorterror</span><br />

<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: Then I started communicating with someone and sent him the code for the modus</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: And he's planning to send some kind of surveillance bot into it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: Hopefully he'll send me more information on it later in time.</span><br />
