[05:25:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( There. ))</span><br />
[05:25:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( did you get my reply to gambit? ))</span><br />
[05:25:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( Even chanserv agreed you should stop screaming. And nyooope. ))</span><br />
[05:26:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( gonna repaste ))</span><br />
[05:26:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its actually me only letting small amounts of air out when I try to exhale... so I don't think it would really work, but I'll stop.</span><br />
[05:26:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( -- CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP] looks up, then slowly and smoothly falls off the couch and rolls under it -- -- CURRENT fLmun [CFL] // Oh my god its like a pot of tea letting steam out! -- CAG: If you keep making that /infernal/ noise, I will remove your vocal cords with my claws. CURRENT fLmun2 [CFL] RIGHT NOW responded to memo.))</span><br />
[05:26:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I /like/ my vocal cords.</span><br />
[05:26:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nah, I was just going to do it as a side effect of tearing out your throat.</span><br />
[05:26:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which would admittedly kill you.</span><br />
[05:26:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ow.</span><br />
[05:26:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would hurt.</span><br />
[05:26:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So I'd have to do everything else /first/, but the throat-tearing would happen.</span><br />
[05:27:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh yeah, the point would be pain.</span><br />
[05:27:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean, death's no big deal, but...</span><br />
[05:27:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: There are many worse things.</span><br />
[05:27:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  almost starts screaming again the same way but catches himself. --</span><br />
[05:27:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yep.</span><br />
[05:27:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Many things worse that death.</span><br />
[05:27:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has very, /very/ sharp teeth and is baring all of them at him in a distinctly unsettling grin*</span><br />
[05:28:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Like losing those close to you.</span><br />
[05:28:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That could also be arranged.</span><br />
[05:28:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is frowning sadly now. --</span><br />
[05:28:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm not /picky/.</span><br />
[05:28:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does it bug you that everyone you knew before the last few months is now /dead/?</span><br />
[05:29:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I stayed behind a bit longer than I should have just to watch the world /burn/.</span><br />
[05:29:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[05:30:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Believe me. I don't miss the old world one bit.</span><br />

[05:32:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't have that sort of power.</span><br />
[05:33:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sucks to be you, then.</span><br />
[05:33:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mr. Brown might, but I don't.</span><br />
[05:34:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *shrugs, scowling over at him*</span><br />
[05:34:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I don't need to be psychic to see bullshit.</span><br />
[05:34:34] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So it's completely impossible to believe that I don't miss a place I hated.</span><br />
[05:34:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: In a world that's everything I wanted.</span><br />
[05:34:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Right, yeah. I see /that/ just fine.</span><br />
[05:35:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you were telling the truth, you wouldn't even know what compassion is.</span><br />
[05:35:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you do.</span><br />
[05:35:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Logic error: does not compute.</span><br />
[05:35:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I took all the people I cared about enough to save into this Game with me.</span><br />
[05:36:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You mean you took everyone you could.</span><br />
[05:36:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No.</span><br />
[05:36:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean that all four people-- all four of my best friends-- entered as part of my chain.</span><br />
[05:37:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[05:37:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fine.</span><br />
[05:37:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You don't care about anyone except four people, and hate everything and everyone else.</span><br />
[05:38:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And /I'd/ ask you to stop sticking words in my mouth for me!</span><br />
[05:38:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: For a Heart Player, you're /damn/ terrible at understanding them!</span><br />
[05:38:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell me Gambit, did you ever visit a library?</span><br />
[05:39:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, of course not. I spent my entire goddamn life avoiding those places like they held the fuckin' /plague/.</span><br />
[05:39:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[05:40:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its sad.</span><br />
[05:40:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I can't help you.</span><br />
[05:40:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sorry.</span><br />
[05:40:59] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, /gee/, you think I need to be "helped".</span><br />
[05:41:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You think that your condescending pity can make you /anything/ more than a mere annoyance with your /own/ bullshit words and "power of friendship".</span><br />
[05:41:31] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Last time that got you fucking /stabbed/.</span><br />
[05:41:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: As well it /should/.</span><br />
[05:41:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

[05:44:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  opens the door to walk out. --</span><br />
[05:45:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  gently shuts it, cutting off whatever Gambit has to say. --</span><br />

[05:46:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  peeks out from under the couch --</span><br />

[05:46:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll be fine...</span><br />
[05:46:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've survived worse.</span><br />
[05:46:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you say so.</span><br />
[05:47:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually considering that "worse" actually somehow manages to hurt LESS...</span><br />
[05:47:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll live.</span><br />
[05:48:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *shrug*</span><br />
[05:48:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I basically have the Concept of the Focus Ribbon to IF the health is dropped to 1hp by the effect, it basically causes FL to be unable to feel the pain to prevent fainting. ))</span><br />
[05:49:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( However if he survives something normally without the effect, its gonna hurt like a bitch. ))</span><br />
