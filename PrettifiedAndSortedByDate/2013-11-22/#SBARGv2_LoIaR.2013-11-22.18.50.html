<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...hi there. ➜</span><br />
DS: it's a bit dark in here, dontcha think?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...yeah. ➜</span><br />
DS: is that like metaphorical or something or are we all too lazy to turn the lights on<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is sobbing grossly into a slice of cake --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not even sure anymore. ➜</span><br />
DS: did your boyfriend dump you or something, cuz there's Ben and Jerry's in the freezer<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what boyfriend? doctorspace hasn't been heard from in months... ((EP isn't really in the RP that much nowadays due to the ban on talking denizens in the incip memo)) ➜</span><br />
DS sits next to SJ<br />
DS: did something happen to him?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not even sure... ➜</span><br />
((When did that happen))<br />
DS: much irony<br />
DS: wow<br />
DS snickers<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he's been know for his infamously long zone out periods... ➜</span><br />
DS: so what's wrong<br />
DS:?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just....general lonlyness because I have no life. ➜</span><br />
DS: this is one hell of a life if you ask me<br />
DS: it's easy to lose sight of perspective when everyone around you is rad as heck<br />
DS: but seriously<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: rad as heck maning you don't hear from them ever again? ➜</span><br />
DS hops up<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *meaning ➜</span><br />
DS uncapatcalouges his sword and shield<br />
DS: you and me...<br />
DS: we are literally gods<br />
DS: in school, I was always the weird kid<br />
DS: I was going nowhere<br />
DS: if only they could see me now<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...what's even the point supposed to be behind attaining godhood anyways? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: watch some alien civilization blow itself up? ➜</span><br />
DS: I dunno. Challenging yourself and becoming a better person I guess<br />
DS: that's what I always heard<br />
DS: but what do I know<br />
DS: I slit my own throat on my quest crypt<br />
(( SJ free toast ))<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((tost attained))</span><br />
((Cool))<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...like, Rob was able to do al those crazy anime things even without ascnding, and MP does our shared title more justice than I ever could. ➜</span><br />
DS: well you get immortality<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...I don't want to be forgotten. ➜</span><br />
DS: what about everybody on earth<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they're too dead to remember. ➜</span><br />
DS: the people who didn't get a copy<br />
DS: why are we alive and they aren't?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because chronos played a sick joke on the few who were stupid enough to follow it. ➜</span><br />
DS: it was a video game, they didn't know they were going to die<br />
DS: they got killed by meteors<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: most of them didn't even know the game was even a thing. ➜</span><br />
DS: the meteors we couldn't stop in time<br />
DS: niki?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...yeah? ➜</span><br />
DS: I'll never forget you<br />
DS hugs<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  hugs back tightly --</span><br />
DS whispers<br />
DS: you smell nice<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  smiles kinda in between gross sobbing and hugs --</span><br />
DS breaks away from the hug<br />
DS: wanna go kill some underlings?<br />
DS: cheer you up?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...not really. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: since when is killing supposed to be cheerful? ➜</span><br />
DS: alright<br />
DS: since the parties in question were non-living game constructs<br />
DS: like punching bags<br />
DS: but they give you money<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but there's not really a reason to fight them anymore. We're not training for anything in particular. ➜</span><br />
DS: I understand what you're saying<br />
DS: so what do you think our universe is going to be?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it's going to be a zillion miles of space, gajillions of planets and stars too far apart from eachother to acknowledge eachother's existance, and then even more space after that. ➜</span><br />
DS: touché<br />
DS: will it have aliens in it?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: of course it'll have aliens. how else will the cycle of kids and fun continue? ➜</span><br />
DS: ha. "Fun."<br />
DS: my race is dead, aside from 30+ kids with supernatural powers<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: exactly... ➜</span><br />
DS: sometimes I hate whoever made this gosh dune paradox space<br />
DS: WHO EVEN CAME UP WITH THIS<br />
DS: I mean, back on earth, everyone was searching for god<br />
DS: we ARE god<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, not of our  old universe. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that was robably the work of another session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *probably ➜</span><br />
DS: so who's the higher power orchestrating all these universes?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heck if I know. ➜</span><br />
DS: extenstensial crisis<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs as well --</span><br />
DS: what should we do about the blue hole<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not even sure... ➜</span><br />
DS: I say just shove FI and SF in it and get it over with<br />
DS: I can't find any other options<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...do you even cae about them? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *care ➜</span><br />
DS: We can't do nothing<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's gotta be a way that doesn't involve sacrifice. ➜</span><br />
DS: I CARE about the 30 humans left, and about winning<br />
DS: either they die, or we all die<br />
DS: either way, they both die<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I know I know, "with loss comes victory". ➜</span><br />
DS: I'll do it myself if I have to<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
