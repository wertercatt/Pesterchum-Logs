<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're tryin' ta get rid 'a me, obviously. Only question is, that really the reason?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Tony Stark doesn't have an assistant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nor does Batman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Jarvis and Alfred don't count.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tony Stark you ain't</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Batman likewise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Jarvis and Alfred totally do both count</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because you're not letting me invent things obviously.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So you want me to either leave you to work your ass off and lol about watchin' movies</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There is even a second option is there that's pretty much it</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What kind of bro would that make me c'mon</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're not going to leave me alone unless I go watch movies.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fine let's go watch movies my gosh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This is worse than when I swore off swearing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Dude if you /really/ don't wanna it's cool but you're actin' really weird and I feel like you're not tellin' me everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Honestly I'm more worried about that then anything else</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're not my diary</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Journal I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I prefer calling it the captain's log.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm not even gonna make a crack about you having a diary</span><br />
