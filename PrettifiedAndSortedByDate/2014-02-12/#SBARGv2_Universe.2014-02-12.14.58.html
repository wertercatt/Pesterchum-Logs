[03:30:44] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think the fact that you /think/ I'm making fun of the aliens speaks pretty badly on your opinion of them but hey that's just me!</span><br />
[03:31:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Silas and Adal kinda have a Heavy/Medic relationship going on, and Nouh has no eyes, soooo...</span><br />

[03:37:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yes I might like the MLP series a little bit, but thats nothing for you to make fun of me about.</span><br />
[03:38:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: shrug, at least you're discreet about it. ➜</span><br />
[03:39:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've only watched all the episodes of season 1 and 2, and some of 3.</span><br />
[03:39:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: none of four.</span><br />

[03:42:33] <span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Ew</span><br />
[03:43:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just like "furry" has been ruined by yiffers?</span><br />

[03:45:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't actually see the big appeal. Maybe I was just hella averse cause of all the hype, or its just cause I haven't watched enough</span><br />
[03:45:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But I mean</span><br />
[03:45:35] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It just seemed like an okay show.</span><br />
[03:45:54] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not /revolutionary/ not awful just. An alright show.</span><br />
[03:46:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I also liked Powerfuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends when I was younger.</span><br />
[03:46:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so it might just be Faust.</span><br />

[03:50:28] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you coming along, charles?</span><br />
[03:51:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, just due to the logic that I wouldn't be dumb enough to damage my own ride.</span><br />

[03:51:35] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you can come along</span><br />
[03:51:40] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just dont do anything stupid</span><br />
[03:52:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so you won't blame me if the ship gets hit by a micrometeor or something bad happens due to murphy's law and the fact a psuedo exile hates me.</span><br />
[03:52:38] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i had no idea there was a reason to blame you but</span><br />

[03:54:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: typo*</span><br />
[03:55:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually, let me put a quirk in to fix that typo.</span><br />
[03:55:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: psuedoexile test</span><br />

[03:56:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay so if I use proper capitalization since its a proper noun I should be okay.</span><br />
[03:58:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...huh, pseudo actually means lying and false... great now I'm paranoid <a href='@_'>@_</a>@</span><br />
[03:59:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so when are you guys going on the maiden flight</span><br />
[03:59:22] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I have absolutely no idea what's going on.</span><br />
[03:59:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then how long will it take afterward to find out that the ship is gonna be overly cramped?</span><br />

[04:03:13] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Anyway nevermind it. You guys did fine getting materials for the ship?</span><br />
[04:03:22] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Actually, how'd you make it, for that matter?</span><br />
[04:04:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Fluffy did the stuff. She took a lot of trips to find materials and how she made it, I have no idea. ➜</span><br />
[04:05:33] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: She had her own spaceship.</span><br />
[04:06:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Works.</span><br />
[04:11:58] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thought police, charles?</span><br />
[04:12:06] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so you were in fact going to bomb the ship?\</span><br />
[04:12:12] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: all i want to know is why</span><br />
[04:13:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, If I was, which I wasn't, I doubt I would have wanted anyone dead...</span><br />
[04:13:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I asked at the bar, and he said the only reason he could think of was to protect us by keeping us from going to space or something</span><br />
[04:13:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: protect us</span><br />
[04:13:49] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: from what</span><br />
[04:14:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I never said protect, I think.</span><br />
[04:14:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where did that come from</span><br />
[04:14:17] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just tell me why</span><br />
[04:14:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to go through the possible explanations.</span><br />
[04:15:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so basically: space is too scary? ➜</span><br />
[04:15:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe some sort of Yandere excuse</span><br />
[04:16:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I doubt I'm that crazy though to be approaching that.</span><br />
[04:16:39] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...yandere</span><br />
[04:16:50] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you didnt think we were gonna leave you behind</span><br />
[04:16:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like maybe I didn't want you guys to leave me here</span><br />
[04:17:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh</span><br />
[04:17:38] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though i can guarantee if you went through with it</span><br />
[04:17:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay I guess maybe since both you and I thought that was it, thats gotta be the case for the theoretical version of me that was planning it.</span><br />
[04:17:46] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you werent coming along once we rebuilt</span><br />
[04:18:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but if I was planning it, it would have been so that I wouldn't have been caught</span><br />
[04:19:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which would have caused me to stop the plan as soon as it was posted...</span><br />
[04:20:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...hey Niki do you think doomed timelines can connect to us using the ring server?</span><br />
[04:20:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe that message wasn't meant for me?</span><br />
[04:20:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but a different me?</span><br />
[04:20:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have no idea. ➜</span><br />
[04:20:34] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'd doubt it though ➜</span><br />
[04:21:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right</span><br />
[04:21:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Dave and Rose lost connection to the trolls when John doomed the timeline, right?</span><br />
[04:21:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But Terezi was able to talk to a doomed dave, right?</span><br />
[04:22:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: true, but that Dave was still physically in the alpha.</span><br />
[04:22:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe /locations/ that are timeline-doomed are out of contact, but doomed /people/ that are in a non-doomed location are talkable.</span><br />
[04:23:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then how did Terezi tell that dave to time travel?</span><br />
[04:23:03] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: charles, stop this doomed timline bullshit</span><br />
[04:23:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right sorry</span><br />
[04:23:12] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: admit what you were planning and we can all go home</span><br />
[04:23:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I WASN'T PLANING IT.</span><br />
[04:23:42] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: quit lying</span><br />
[04:23:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im not that mad at you</span><br />
[04:23:50] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im over it now</span><br />

[04:24:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: do you want me to lie and say I was planning that shit?</span><br />
[04:25:30] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whatever</span><br />
