[04:42:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, question for later: when I set up the MC server (possibly this week, idk), what version should it be?</span><br />
[04:43:09] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: newest or 1.6.4</span><br />
[04:43:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: 1.7.2 seems to be current (not counting 1.7.4 bugfixes), but for OptiFine users, 1.6.4 is the latest possible version...</span><br />
[04:43:27] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: then 1.6.4</span><br />
[04:43:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk</span><br />
[04:46:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (I wonder if 1.6 is when the <span style="color:#bacafe">Bacafe</span> map was created... otherwise I'll have to mcedit the build over to a fresh map)</span><br />
[04:47:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Just MC Edit it onto a flatland and we can do terrain sculpting. ))</span><br />
[04:47:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( actually, let me have FL say that. ))</span><br />
[04:47:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just MC Edit it onto a flatland and we can do terrain sculpting.</span><br />
[04:48:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...yeah, that'd probably work better.</span><br />
[04:51:26] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: is it a modded server or what...</span><br />
[04:52:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure yet. someone suggested I use... Spigot, I think the server program is?</span><br />
[04:52:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but the game itself will still be vanilla</span><br />
[04:52:49] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: baby pigmens</span><br />
[04:52:56] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh okay</span><br />
[04:52:58] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: cool</span><br />
[04:53:11] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Except i'm worried these assholes are going to grief me...</span><br />
[04:53:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe gameplay mods at some point, but at first, not really</span><br />
[04:53:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and AC, long as it stays a private server we should be fine</span><br />
[04:54:13] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: okay</span><br />
[04:54:20] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: so you guys aren't griefers, right?</span><br />
[04:55:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't grief.</span><br />
[04:55:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I... might plan a Griefing Party or two at some point, but 1) it'll be announced in advance, and 2) the map will be backed up beforehand.</span><br />
[04:55:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but regularly, no I don't grief</span><br />
[04:56:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My method of griefing is accidently breaking an aquarium that I filled too much with a dispenser with squid spawn eggs.</span><br />
[04:56:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FLYING SQUIDS</span><br />
[04:56:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (unless "throwing an inventory's worth of cluckbeast eggs at a Vriska RPer" counts as griefing ::::P)</span><br />
[04:57:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH GOD THE SQUIDS ARE EVERYWHERE</span><br />
[04:57:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: (she's a bitch so no one gives a shit about her</span><br />
[04:57:29] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: seen enough hentai to know where this is going</span><br />
[04:57:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also is this server going to have an icecream supply?</span><br />
[04:57:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause I could make it.</span><br />
[04:58:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: set the top of the grass flatland to Y level 64.</span><br />
[04:59:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm not setting up the server right now, but when I do, I'll ask what needs doing for what.</span><br />
[05:01:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[05:01:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are we going to use a texture pack?</span><br />
[05:03:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'll be using OkamiCraft locally (hence the OptiFine requirement), but there won't be an enforced server texpack.</span><br />
[05:03:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[05:03:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll make the icecream out of Wooden Planks and Snow.</span><br />

[05:05:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The servers public icecream supply.</span><br />
