[06:06:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does not immediately attack the imps, since they seem to be dying anyway, and looks around to get a better sense of the area --</span><br />

[06:06:36] That's a good question, MA. The ground is very, very flat all around you. Where could they possibly be?<br />
[06:06:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  lands next to RS --</span><br />

[06:09:50] The ground does not seem to be there partway across CP's room.<br />
[06:09:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  spits out the word, taking a shaky step forward, then a not-so-shaky step. --</span><br />

[06:10:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  welp, another noncollideable tile. faaaaaaaalling again --</span><br />
[06:11:25] CP may want to learn to walk more carefully. Nevertheless, he lands in a pit of black velvet. Why is everything so /dark/ here?<br />
[06:12:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  winces a bit at his movements, but shrugs as he regains his footing --</span><br />
[06:12:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  take out The Fool and shifts it into a board, a swing of the hand calling a miniature raincloud to traverse the room, eyes attentive to where or not the rain starts going through the floor in any spots. --</span><br />
[06:13:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws a mini Sunrise to light the area. visible skybox requirement? Unbounded Canvas Badge, bipches --</span><br />
[06:13:53] The rain does, in fact, fall through the floor in three places. If he can see well enough, midway through the room there also appear to be clawmarks on the wall.<br />
[06:14:21] CP sees a hell of a lot of black velvet and a straggly serpent-thing making its slow and painful way towards him.<br />
[06:16:00] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...c'mon.</span><br />
[06:16:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws Icestorm and just sort of puts the serpent out of its misery. why are all the underlings in here /at like 1HP/? --</span><br />
[06:16:45] Well, has CP ever heard of LOIAV before? Does he recognise a Player's name that goes with it?<br />
[06:16:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  transforms the board into Belial's Wingman, hopping on to hover across the road and feel the wall aroudn the claw marks. --</span><br />
[06:16:59] â€¦ the serpent is, however, easily put out of its misery.<br />
[06:17:09]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *starts feeling around for any holes in the ground in a 2 yard radius about him, starting right where the flare had come from*</span><br />

[06:17:37] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: it appears she has been through here...</span><br />
[06:18:01] The wall seems solid. Solid and clawed up like some sort of scratching post. For a very large and angry cat.<br />
[06:18:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has heard the landcronym before, but this is his first visit here and doesn't know whose land it is --</span><br />

[06:19:08] Then he knows nothing. The pit seems to be just that. A pit. Why's there a pit in the middle of the bloody ground?<br />
[06:19:27] MA goes down, down, downâ€¦ if he so desires, that is.<br />
[06:19:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats down the closest hole in the ground, then. --</span><br />
[06:19:34] Eventually, he may see RS and FS.<br />
[06:20:07] Raz finds nothing. Except a hole in the ground. A big fucking hole in the ground.<br />
[06:20:37]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( fffs brb, auto-pilot him finding them and tagging along pls ))</span><br />
[06:21:20] Raz and FS see MA. MA sees them. They are all one big happy family.<br />
[06:21:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  did I find anything yet? --</span><br />
[06:21:33] You found a pit in the ground, CP.<br />
[06:21:42] There does not appear to be anything down there.<br />
[06:21:50] Perhaps it was a trap designed to catch those who could not see through the void.<br />
[06:22:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has a zipboard, and also Cherry Bombs. and velvet is probably soft enough to blow holes in. so I try that --</span><br />
[06:22:58] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ((yaaaaaaaay))</span><br />
[06:23:10] CP is now bombing the pit. He is able to bomb the pit. The pit is bombed.<br />
[06:23:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  should've specified, he bombs the /walls/ around where the serpent was --</span><br />
[06:23:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats back up. --</span><br />
[06:23:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats down another pit. --</span><br />
[06:24:42] â€¦ The walls are also bombed. It looks like this really was just a pit trap.<br />
[06:24:57] Raz finds nothing. Not even a monster. But he only checked /one/ bit of the walls, didn't he...?<br />
[06:25:43] What's FS doing through all this?<br />
[06:26:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  presumably following RS cuz gotta keep the party together and stoofs --</span><br />
[06:26:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  a burst of fire runs up from the pit RS went into. --</span><br />
[06:26:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  turns around and zipboards outy, back through a lot of shitty repeated-texture noncollideable velvet terrain tiles to the surface, then down through where he saw RS fall earlier --</span><br />
[06:26:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  an instant before it burns FS the stuff turns white, luckily for him. --</span><br />
[06:26:59] FS may want to not follow RS too closely. There were zombie rats last time...<br />
[06:27:16] CP manages to find the rest of the party!<br />
[06:27:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  blinks like HOLY SHIT --</span><br />
[06:27:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  motherbarking /finally/ --</span><br />
[06:27:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, hey guys.</span><br />
[06:27:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  decides following RS may not be as good an idea --</span><br />
[06:27:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies back up, clutching his chest. Hair shadows his eyes as he just floats there, trembling faintly --</span><br />
[06:28:05] CP is in a black, wet room with clawmarks on one of the walls and three apparent pits in the floor.<br />
[06:28:17] It contains Raz, FS, and MA.<br />
[06:28:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: check the /walls/...</span><br />
[06:28:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  blinks wide eyed, then turns to CP --</span><br />
[06:28:36] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: oh... hello kimura</span><br />
[06:28:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
[06:28:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently, I fell down a fake alternate path</span><br />
[06:28:56] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: just... nearly got incinerated...</span><br />
[06:28:58] It's true. He did.<br />
[06:29:04] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: not a terribly huge deal</span><br />
[06:29:05] â€¦ That applies to both statements.<br />
[06:29:19] So, what's everyone up to now?<br />
[06:29:26] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: good to have you back with us then</span><br />
[06:30:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: find anything yet? besides super deudly fire pits?</span><br />
[06:30:32] Super deudly Raz pits, maybe...<br />
[06:30:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /WHAT PART OF CHECK THE FUCKING WALLS DID YOU MISS/</span><br />
[06:31:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  explodes in fire, the stuff wreathing him in a flash. --</span><br />
[06:31:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  cherry-bombs the fucking walls --</span><br />
[06:31:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  shrugs before checking the wall with the clawmarks again --</span><br />
[06:31:55] One of CP's bombs does not blast a hole in anything.<br />
[06:32:05] It seems there was already a hole there.<br />
[06:32:06] Hmm...<br />
[06:32:15] It's not particularly near the clawmarks, though...<br />
[06:33:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  investigates the pre-existing hole --</span><br />
[06:33:16] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[06:33:22] His investigative body part goes right through the fucking wall.<br />
[06:33:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  eyebrowraises --</span><br />
[06:34:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater's <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS'S]</span>  flames die down, turning white before fading completely. --</span><br />
[06:34:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  follows his heart in the most unironic manner possible, hoping the charm leads through that hole and closer to AG --</span><br />
[06:35:13] Raz is definitively able to go through the fucking wall.<br />
[06:35:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows RS through the fucking wall --</span><br />
[06:36:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  keeps hovering about, eventually gliding over to where the rest had gone through --</span><br />
[06:36:58] Well, the four of them are in another black velvet room, albeit one that looks like something set it the hell on fire and watched it burn.<br />
[06:37:26] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
[06:37:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  but I only just got here <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> --</span><br />
[06:37:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is it still on fire though, or just charred? --</span><br />
[06:37:41] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: it seems that we are on the right track</span><br />
[06:37:58] It's charred as hell. The fire looks /recent/, yesâ€¦ but either the fire went out or something forcibly put it out.<br />
[06:38:08] The room also bears signs of a small tornado, so...<br />
[06:38:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  okay good, I don't have to use Galestorm then... because something apparently already did... --</span><br />
[06:38:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies over to the far wall and taps along...Okay calling what he's doing tapping is like calling a hurricane a small weather system. Punching the wall to see if it's solid. --</span><br />
[06:39:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  hooray for nonviolent ways of working off aggression! --</span><br />
[06:39:03] The wall is solid. Also very soft. Mm, feel the velvet...<br />
[06:39:13] But that's just one wall, of course.<br />
[06:39:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( back ))</span><br />
[06:39:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies over to the next, punching it in turn. Fuck walls. Always trying to stop you from /going/ places. --</span><br />
[06:39:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  umbrellajetpacks over to one of the other walls of the room, running his hands along the velvet as he goes by --</span><br />
[06:40:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  feels along the other wall that no one's trying yet --</span><br />
[06:41:44]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *tries feeling along the ceiling instead*</span><br />
[06:41:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks shere he is, as he zoned out. --</span><br />
[06:41:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where*</span><br />
[06:42:17] Raz eventually manages to punch a hole through the wallâ€¦ oh waitâ€¦ that was already ther<br />
[06:42:23] *there.<br />
[06:42:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: got it.</span><br />
[06:42:48] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: come on.</span><br />
[06:42:51] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: excellent</span><br />
[06:42:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies through the wall. --</span><br />
[06:43:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  follows RS through the hole in the wall --</span><br />
[06:43:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows --</span><br />
[06:43:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Faster, faster...!</span><br />
[06:43:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is so angry he's urging the narration to go faster. Or is he just trying to get to AG faster? --</span><br />
[06:44:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the world may never know --</span><br />
[06:44:13]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *follows as well*</span><br />
[06:44:18] The narration ignores him. /Fuck/ him.<br />
[06:44:45] The next room looks like some sort of arena made entirely out of black velvet.<br />
[06:45:20] It's exactly the sort of place one would expect to find a boss-type monster ready and waiting to murder them the moment they stepped onto the floor-- why is the floor covered in lava...?<br />
[06:45:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Is FL with CP? ))</span><br />
[06:45:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has been on his zipboard for a bit now. fuck lava. --</span><br />
[06:46:02]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...</span><br />
[06:46:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  is glad he was hovering on his umbrellajetpack --</span><br />
[06:46:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also, I'm with RS and FS --</span><br />
[06:46:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  idk where you and Ash are --</span><br />
[06:46:45]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( ash is apparently tagging along? ))</span><br />
[06:46:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I figure they would have stuck with FS and CP? ))</span><br />
[06:46:57] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Yeah im here just hella distracted))</span><br />
[06:47:05] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Family being a bunch of Needy cunts))</span><br />
[06:47:36] If one were to look past the lava, it would look like something tore the fuck out of the floor. However, there is lava everywhere, so...<br />
[06:48:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is floating as well, hooray floating. Hoverboards fuck yeah --</span><br />
[06:48:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[06:48:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is using his jet wings --</span><br />
[06:48:47]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... *he can't even muster a reaction to all the lava on the ground*</span><br />
[06:49:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is the lava floating through the hole in the floor down somewhere? --</span><br />
[06:49:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:49:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, think you can cool down that lava?</span><br />
[06:49:53] Noâ€¦ it just looks like there's aâ€¦ oh, wait, no, there is a hole.<br />
[06:50:01] There is also lava flowing down into that hole.<br />
[06:50:12] A different hole than the clawmarks, perhaps, and over near one of the corners...<br />
[06:50:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: got a water source to draw the Waterspout from? I don't have a water bucket with me...</span><br />
[06:50:39] Then again, there's what looks to be the site of an explosion in the ceiling, so who knows.<br />
[06:50:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  and because of minecraft logic, summoning rain with Deluge won't cool the lava --</span><br />
[06:51:15] Not if it's magic.<br />
[06:51:27] But what is this "minecraft logic" you speak of here?<br />
[06:51:31] You fell down the rabbit hole, dear.<br />
[06:51:34] You're in Wonderland now.<br />
[06:51:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, the human body is mostly water...</span><br />
[06:51:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[06:51:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I do have this.</span><br />
[06:51:52] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
[06:51:54] FL's is certainly a great idea.<br />
[06:51:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a water bottle. --</span><br />
[06:51:59] The narration recommends it.<br />
[06:52:04] It would make the narration laugh.<br />
[06:52:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, close enough.</span><br />
[06:52:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  twists open the lid. --</span><br />
[06:52:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  fuck it. --</span><br />
[06:52:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  brings up the Brush Pad and, upon confirming it detects the water bottle as a water source, scribbles a Waterspout over all the lava --</span><br />
[06:53:19] The narration liked the human water source idea betterâ€¦ it's quite possibly pouting now.<br />
[06:53:35] And now there is wet, rapidly cooling into lava rock, lava.<br />
[06:53:50] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also yeah, minecraft logic hardly ever applies when the narration is crazy --</span><br />
[06:54:04] The narration prefers the term "sanity-challenged".<br />
[06:54:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, a few more moments, then with the lack of heat radiation, we should be able to walk on the rock.</span><br />
[06:55:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies over to the far wall and feels along it to see if it's solid or not --</span><br />
[06:55:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Now then.</span><br />
[06:56:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, try and write on all the walls of this room.</span><br />
[06:56:50] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does so, even though brush ink texture isn't affected by noncollideability --</span><br />
[06:57:11] CP leaves pretty drawings everywhere and Raz's fist does not sink through.<br />
[06:57:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay.</span><br />
[06:57:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  actually, he should just stop trying to logic... even though as a Light Player, knowledge about stuff is his Thing --</span><br />
[06:57:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There needs to be a fake wall...</span><br />
[06:57:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:57:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  checks the other walls in turn expecting them to be solid but not content with expectations --</span><br />
[06:58:06] They are...<br />
[06:58:08] ...<br />
[06:58:09] Solid.<br />
[06:58:11] Yup.<br />
[06:58:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I so need to make spray paint bombs.</span><br />

[06:59:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( what about waterspout? ))</span><br />
[07:00:01] The narration did not say it was liquid lava.<br />
[07:00:07] The narration just forgot the word for hard lava.<br />

[07:00:36] â€¦ The narration politely requests that FL go fuck himself, and then beats his rock with paper.<br />
[07:00:49] No, it's lava. The narration never said the lava was meant to be there, now did it?<br />
[07:00:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lizard. ))</span><br />
[07:00:56] Come on now, folks. Why is there lava?<br />
[07:00:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also on the topic: is a lava pit at the bottom of a mineshaft too cliche?))</span><br />

[07:01:09] No. I'll /make/ you a lava pit if you want.<br />

[07:25:19] The narration's comment on "he managed to survive the lava" implies he is not dead.<br />

[07:36:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Rob, we going back for them?</span><br />
[07:36:51] There doesn't seem to be anything living in there, either.<br />
[07:36:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Or do we need to blow up this room?</span><br />

[07:37:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And going back...How would we get them to this side?</span><br />
[07:37:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  uses the "Fire Tablet is Moon Tribe tech, not magic" logic from earlier and power-swims down the hole or something --</span><br />

[07:39:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats around the room feeling the walls --</span><br />
[07:39:11] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  speaking of which, I finish swimming down the hole to the other side --</span><br />
[07:39:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  just assumes that this doesn't nullify aspect powers anymore or something? --</span><br />
[07:39:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think we need to let off an explosion in here.</span><br />
[07:39:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  did he get that right? --</span><br />
[07:39:26]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Yeeeah, I forget I can do that a lot. Ahaha...</span><br />
[07:39:48]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Well, let's check along the walls and stuff first.</span><br />
[07:39:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  examines the walls... what kind of explosion is it? Mushroom Cloud? Blasty explosion? --</span><br />

[07:40:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we are trying to get to the next room...</span><br />
[07:40:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the lava probably doesn't null powers anymore, no. --</span><br />
[07:40:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  just regular lava at this point --</span><br />
[07:40:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we need explosives I believe.</span><br />

[07:41:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  HOPS RIGHT ON INTO THE LAVA CUZ FUCKIIIIIIIIIIIT --</span><br />
[07:41:26] The explosions look to be blast explosions, marking random spots all over the walls, floor and ceiling.<br />
[07:41:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  is surrounded by shadows as he swims down the hole and eventually joins the others again --</span><br />

[07:41:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  feels around the walls keeps doing that --</span><br />
[07:41:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cherry Bomb?</span><br />
[07:42:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws a bunch of bombs near the markings --</span><br />
[07:42:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: already ahead of ya :P</span><br />
[07:42:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />

[07:42:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the drawings /turn into/ cherry bombs, dumpass --</span><br />

[07:44:11] Even so, the explosions from the bombs do nothing but make more markings where the explode.<br />
[07:44:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:44:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Burn it.</span><br />
[07:44:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Velvet is flamable, right?</span><br />
[07:45:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if it was, the lava from earlier would've already incinerated the room...</span><br />
[07:45:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...if not the entire planet...</span><br />
[07:45:13]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *is searching along the ceiling of the room*</span><br />
[07:45:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  totally keeps feeling the walls trying to see if there are any gaps in it, wheee --</span><br />
[07:45:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Try Rejuvenation for a second.</span><br />
[07:45:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There might have been something in here.</span><br />
[07:45:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  notes that kimura has a point as he boggles about the room as well, his voidwreath eventually dissipating --</span><br />
[07:46:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs and tries filling in one of the charred areas with ink --</span><br />
[07:46:39] As MA is searching, he feels a gap in the wall.<br />
[07:46:50]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... I got it! I think.</span><br />
[07:48:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The ceiling?</span><br />
[07:48:53] The narration corrects itself, it meant to say the ceiling, not the wall.<br />
[07:50:02] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the ceiling. --</span><br />
[07:50:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Up?</span><br />
[07:50:08] The narration also thinks it's funny that CP is trying to use logic.<br />
[07:50:21]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Yeah, up here...</span><br />
[07:50:39] The only logic that exists here is enough illogic to kill a small third-world country by dumping poison in their water in the thoughts that it would make them better somehow.<br />
[07:50:45] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  hovers up... trying to stick his head up there. --</span><br />
[07:51:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  watches the others, then zipboards up --</span><br />

[07:53:06] Oh, wait, haha, no, someone already went through the hole. Someone who wasâ€¦ how /was/ she feeling, Raz?<br />
[07:53:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...What kind of zombie? ))</span><br />
[07:53:12] Ask Raz.<br />

[07:56:00] Instead of a zombie rat, they find a sodden, clawed-to-high-Hel room. The velvet is absolutely /soaked/ withâ€¦ something.<br />

[07:57:20]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Rob?!</span><br />
[07:57:22] Some of it might be blood. Are you really going to check? There's a pocket computer resting in one corner, though, screen set to sleep mode but glowing faintly nonetheless.<br />

[07:59:13] There are no large objects on the Land's surface. It is completely flat and made of black velvet. There is also no traceable human activity.<br />
[07:59:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  ^ yeah that --</span><br />

[08:00:11] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CGA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[08:00:34] The only evident features about the room are the whatever it's soaked with, the random progressively-deeper clawmarks, and the pocket computer.<br />
[08:01:22] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
[08:01:49] This far underground on LOIAV, communications with the outside world have been rendered impossible. All messages will show up blank, all voice-comms white noise, all video feeds nothing but static. The party is now nearly untraceable.<br />
[08:02:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  walks over to the computer, checking it with a feeling he knows exactly what and whose it is. --</span><br />

[08:03:04] The velvet seems to sting him a little as he touches it. Perhaps an effect of whatever is soaking it. The computer, however, wakes itself up when Raz approaches.<br />
[08:03:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks at the computer. --</span><br />

[08:04:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  withdraws his ungloved hand abruptly --</span><br />

[08:06:19] AE: My partner left me here after she said my voice annoyed her too greatly-- at least, I believe that is what was said.<br />

[08:08:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is making a reference. --</span><br />
[08:08:23] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Sorry.</span><br />
[08:08:28] AE: *got the reference*<br />
[08:08:28] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But anytime other then now.</span><br />
[08:08:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  high-fives FL for the Dr Who ref :P --</span><br />
[08:08:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is hi fived. --</span><br />
[08:08:54] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do you want to hitch a ride? My COMP's got more then enough space for it.</span><br />
[08:08:57] AE: I would prefer you catch up to my partner before she reaches the final room.<br />
[08:09:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ah.</span><br />
[08:09:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Should we just blow our way through?</span><br />
[08:09:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And use portable holes and such?</span><br />
[08:09:31] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...did you happen to see where she went then?</span><br />
[08:09:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Catch up. Can do.</span><br />
[08:09:49] AE: And that would be nice, Raz. Yes. She went through the exit.<br />
[08:10:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  motions to the device on his arm, <a href='http://images.wikia.com/megamitensei/images/9/9f/COMPSMTIV.jpg'>http://images.wikia.com/megamitensei/images/9/9f/COMPSMTIV.jpg</a> . Extends a USB cable from the thing and plugs it into the computer. --</span><br />
[08:10:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay.</span><br />
[08:10:45] The girl transfers herself over onto the device, leaving the pocket computer void.<br />
[08:11:11] AE: Andâ€¦ if at all possible, please do not destroy this Land. Not here.<br />
[08:11:44] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Of course.</span><br />
[08:11:49]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... *captchas the pocket computer*</span><br />
[08:11:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads for the exit. --</span><br />
[08:12:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  hovers over to the exit as well --</span><br />
[08:12:12]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *follows after*</span><br />
[08:12:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows, on autopilot since his author is eating pizza and doesn't want goop on his keyboard --</span><br />
[08:12:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  behinds to check his stock of items... MISC Adventure Gear, Check. Anti Anti Magic Field generator, check. Portable Hole x3, check. Antimatter Capsules x20... check, but he aint pulling it out. --</span><br />
[08:12:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we are all set.</span><br />
[08:13:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  runs after. --</span><br />
[08:16:08] The girl has pointed out the exit (on one of the walls), and watched the party troop through. The sounds of screaming can now be heard faintly in the distance.<br />
[08:16:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  starts running ahead now. --</span><br />
[08:17:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We better move faster.</span><br />
[08:17:16] They find themselves in another room, one that bears no visible signs of damage.<br />
[08:17:31] Or anything else.<br />
[08:17:38] How many rooms can there even /be/...?<br />
[08:18:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks for the next exit. --</span><br />
[08:18:37] Beautiful black velvet.<br />
[08:19:01]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: God damn, how much more...?</span><br />
[08:19:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  ignores the velvet and zooms around the room. --</span><br />
[08:19:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // With a hand on the wall. --</span><br />
[08:19:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // SO MUCH STATIC. --</span><br />
[08:19:44] The narration is inclined to agree. The velvet is hard to ignore, though. It's what the room is made of. And interestingly enough, FL's hand sinks through said wall very, very close to where they came in.<br />
[08:19:51] It might have even been the same hole.<br />
[08:20:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:20:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks the hole anyway. --</span><br />
[08:20:06]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Hm?</span><br />
[08:20:39] It's certainly a hole. A hole that goes forward into a passagewayâ€¦ and just /stops/.<br />
[08:20:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:20:46] Although the wall does feel suspiciously bumpy...<br />
[08:20:59] Are thoseâ€¦ /rungs/?<br />
[08:21:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  goes into the passageway. --</span><br />
[08:21:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets see... do I... climb?</span><br />
[08:21:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tries to head up from the end of the passageway. --</span><br />
[08:21:46] It certainly seems possible.<br />
[08:21:54]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *pokes his head into the hole*</span><br />
[08:22:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Try to keep up.</span><br />
[08:22:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  climbs. --</span><br />
[08:22:09] There is blackness. Light actually doesn't seem to work in this hole.<br />
[08:22:18] But nevertheless, there is blackness and climbing.<br />
[08:22:21]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Uh... okay. *climbs after them*</span><br />
[08:22:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is climbing... climbing... --</span><br />
[08:22:35] Until they emerge in a room that's not made of black velvet, but metal bars.<br />
[08:22:44] And the metal bars are right in front of them.<br />
[08:23:16] They seem to be some sort of maze.<br />
[08:23:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:23:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fuck this.</span><br />
[08:23:30] Hang on, FL.<br />
[08:23:32] Sit. Stay.<br />
[08:23:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  preforms a spin attack, attempting to slice the bars. --</span><br />
[08:24:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  clutches the charm around his neck to make sure they're going the right way --</span><br />
[08:24:23] As the narration was /going to say/, many of the metal bars look bent, twisted, or outright broken in a path leading to the centre.<br />
[08:24:39]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Uh...</span><br />
[08:24:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:24:42] Blood is on the ends of many of the bars.<br />
[08:24:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: heh</span><br />
[08:24:45] The spin attack works, though.<br />
[08:25:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  goes straight ahead, following the path. --</span><br />
[08:25:28] Most of the bars have been smashed into jagged points or shoved out of the wayâ€¦ and either way, /ow/.<br />
[08:25:35] Whoever came through here sure didn't care.<br />
[08:25:46] FL does successfully make it through. The narration is proud.<br />
[08:26:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, next area.</span><br />
[08:26:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  follows the trail of destruction, expression stark --</span><br />
[08:26:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks the ceiling and floor of the center. --</span><br />
[08:26:43] He's in the centre. More blood is on the ground.<br />
[08:27:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  follows along as well, his expression grim --</span><br />
[08:27:03] There's no exit on either the ceiling or floor.<br />
[08:27:10] But also no more broken metal bars.<br />
[08:27:20] The bars don't seem to be in a maze anymore, though...<br />
[08:27:27] Just in a circle around a makeshift arena.<br />
[08:27:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...This just screams "trap" to me.</span><br />
[08:27:34] Was the maze only to get /in/?<br />
[08:27:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stops his authorial-afk zoneout in time to look around at the very obvious trap --</span><br />
[08:28:03]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...</span><br />
[08:28:09] Something has obviously been through here. Said something is no longer here. So where did it /go/?<br />
[08:28:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:28:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See the invisible...</span><br />
[08:28:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[08:28:50] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  activates GOGGLES OF TRUE SEEING emulation mode on his shades. --</span><br />
[08:29:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  taps his glasses, shifting on Lens of Truth functionality on. --</span><br />
[08:29:17] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: GAMBIT!!!!!</span><br />
[08:29:24] And before FL and Raz, a path opens clear as day. Part of the bar cageâ€¦ was not real?<br />
[08:29:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:29:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads to the gap. --</span><br />
[08:29:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat.</span><br />
[08:29:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We totally need to pack more goggles or lenses.</span><br />
[08:30:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  clutches the charm, is this the right way? --</span><br />
[08:30:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, definitely...</span><br />
[08:31:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  walks toward the gap in the bars, looking to see if some part of the floor is fake or if there's anything noteworthy in the area --</span><br />
[08:31:57] He is able to get through the gap. It looks to be a straight path forward, but the floor also does not look quite thereâ€¦ not quite there /at all/...<br />
[08:32:41] Uh. Who replaced the floor with a pit of spikes?<br />
[08:32:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:33:07] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Watch the ground. It's fake and opens into a spike trap.</span><br />
[08:33:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  starts floating, fuck yeah Spark Regalia. --</span><br />
[08:33:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats, no, flies forward --</span><br />
[08:33:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gets back on the zipboard --</span><br />
[08:33:37] Floating is in no way against the rules. Nor is flying.<br />
[08:33:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  just follows on the umbrellajetpack because it seems like the sensible thing to do --</span><br />
[08:34:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is using his jet wings. --</span><br />
[08:34:02] Sensible. Yes. Very.<br />
[08:34:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  senses the narrator is trying to say "trap" --</span><br />
[08:34:27] They fly forwards.<br />
[08:34:36] The narration knows how to say trap.<br />
[08:34:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:34:48] CP's narrator-senses need work.<br />
[08:34:54]  <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA:  *follows along on his rocketshoes as he had been the entire time*</span><br />
[08:34:55] What do they find when they fly?<br />
[08:34:58] A zombie rat.<br />
[08:35:01] No, just kidding.<br />
[08:35:09] The zombie rat was dismembered ages ago.<br />
[08:35:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  would have sliced up the rat. --</span><br />
[08:35:24] They instead feel a burgeoning sense of heat.<br />
[08:35:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:35:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More lava?</span><br />
[08:35:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GREAT.</span><br />
[08:35:40] It's getting hot in here, that's for sure...<br />
[08:35:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: for crying out loud, enough of this stuff already...</span><br />
[08:36:03] The next room they emerge into would be entirely on fire.<br />
[08:36:08] No lava, however.<br />
[08:36:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:36:16] Just as if a miniature sun ignited half the room.<br />
[08:36:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  examines the fire. --</span><br />
[08:36:22] And then the fire spread.<br />
[08:36:55] It seems to be regular fire. But it is regular fire on absolutely everything except one part of the far wall, where there is no fire or anything whatsoever.<br />
[08:37:00] However, there is a /lot/ of fire.<br />
[08:37:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws Galestorm to blow the fire out --</span><br />
[08:37:09] Never mind.<br />
[08:37:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> --</span><br />
[08:37:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:37:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads to the part of the far wall. --</span><br />
[08:37:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads over to that part of the far wall, feeling it with his hand --</span><br />
[08:38:04] The charred, smoking room allows them to pass. So pass they do. Pass right through the wall.<br />
[08:38:18] Goddamn, is this what it feels like to be a Voider who can go through whatever walls she wants?<br />
[08:38:20] Fuck you, walls!<br />
[08:38:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  indeed. --</span><br />
[08:38:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats through the wall, and onward --</span><br />
[08:39:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  zipboards through the wall --</span><br />
[08:39:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  flies on through that wall --</span><br />
[08:39:16] The screaming stopped midway through that room. The silence is almost more eerie.<br />
[08:39:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:39:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just keeps looking with the goggle mode. --</span><br />
[08:40:03] Everything is black. Like, even the bit of the floor that isn't there is black. Because the passageway is made of black velvet.<br />
[08:40:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  wait there was screaming? --</span><br />
[08:40:38] At one point.<br />
[08:40:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:40:44] Right, Raz?<br />
[08:40:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let there be like.</span><br />
[08:40:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:40:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: light*</span><br />
[08:40:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP?</span><br />
[08:41:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats onward, a little more urgently now --</span><br />
[08:41:19] The narration politely requests that someone say Maxwell's laws before there can be light.<br />
[08:41:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws Sunrise because derp --</span><br />
[08:41:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  lands, walking briskly now in case any part of the floor isn't in fact real --</span><br />
[08:42:27] Raz falls through the floor. Also there is light.<br />
[08:42:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks now, obviously with some light now. --</span><br />
[08:42:36] Light enough to watch Raz fall through the floor.<br />
[08:42:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, there.</span><br />
[08:42:44] Whee, Raz!<br />
[08:42:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  hovers over to Rob. --</span><br />
[08:42:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp</span><br />
[08:42:46] Raz is on a slide!<br />
[08:42:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  blinks as RS falls through --</span><br />
[08:42:53] Doesn't everyone just love slides?<br />
[08:42:55] <span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: oh dear...</span><br />
[08:43:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  goes over and oh look a slide in the floor --</span><br />
[08:43:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:43:45] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  free-falls --</span><br />

[08:44:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  yells back "COME ON!" --</span><br />
[08:44:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  deactivates his jet wings because SLIDE! :d --</span><br />
[08:44:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D*</span><br />
[08:44:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  engages autofollow because his author is making dinner --</span><br />
[08:45:02] They slide down the slide just in time to see what looks to be a huge worm that is on fire explode into grist.<br />
[08:45:12] There's no one in sight, though.<br />
[08:45:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:45:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit.</span><br />
