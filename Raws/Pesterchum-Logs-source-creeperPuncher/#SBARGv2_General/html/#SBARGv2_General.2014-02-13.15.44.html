<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm listening ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I decided to defect from the United States of Ponyfuckers to Soviet Homestucks, to ripoff MGS3.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You all reignited my hope in the fandom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Sure, I think you are pretty misguided, most of you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: But what can I say? We all are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: That said, for a while, I thought that the fandom was Hitler 2: Gas Harder. It's not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: It's...something else. In a good way, mind you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: On one hand, shipping wars. Just...shipping wars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: One second. I need to cringe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: The art is CUHRAYZEE good, this wasn't a disaster, the music is catchy...okay you get the point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: And "not a disaster" is like IGN giving actual reasons for something being good: rare.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Okay enough sucking up. Time to get on with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Think we can at least try to make the old times happen again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure about that. You'd have to talk with NN about that. Also, SL's been banned for repeated offences recently. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b I think the best thing to do is to offer a written apology for your past offenses to the rest of the GM team. If it makes you feel any better, I'd be alright as long as you promise to stay on your best behavior. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Gotta be honest, I don't think apologies helped anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: But if it floats their boat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Guess I can kick myself in the ass and type up a damn novel called "Why I'm Sorry For Being Worse Than Hitler: A Memoir"</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: But it's like a rope. If you cut it, you can tie it together, but the knot will be always there.</span><br />
