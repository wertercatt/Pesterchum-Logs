<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((I'm sorry to do this now after making such a big deal out of sticking around, but I cannot stay on any of the public memos. The reason is Ash. For months now she's been constantly belittling me, making me do things for her, and calling me childish and disrespectful if I ask her to stop or to do something in return. I either clam up immediately and nothing changes, or I press the issue, go too far and hurt other people, and end up the villain. I'm sure once I leave she'll try to paint me as the villain on this one, too. It's even worse now, since I'm sure any degree of standing up for myself will be used as an argument that I've made my 5th strike and I'll get banned. I'll try to stay in touch with the people I care about and who care about me, but I can't keep doing this to myself. I can't stay in the memo with someone as abusive and manipulative as Ash is. Maybe if Ash left I could stick around, but we all know that's not gonna happen. Tell Kaylen she can come back. And Ash, you're going to need to find a new Tavros.))</span><br />
