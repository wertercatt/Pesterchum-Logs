<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 BLUE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  The blue room... well, how to describe the blue room? Creepy as fuck, thats it! Specimens of all size and shape are stored in shelves, on podiums, and in vats of ecto goo. And with the UV lighting... kinda creepy look to it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT gameManagement [CGM]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Gasp! Well, then I'll help in whatever way I can! I'm always happy to help a friend!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  appears in the blue room --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *calls back* SJ! CP! Over here!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: .... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  appears... and staaares at the weird science --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  walks over towards AG --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  It just goes on and on, getting weirder and weirder. The stuffed specimines seem to now be hunching over on their podiums and spaces. It eventually reaches a dead end, the last thing being a sort of mix between a Plesiosaur and an anglerfish. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  points at the unholy genetic hybrid. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ........ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what the.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: This is Pallas, please give it its key.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um.... hi there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  pulls out the copper key --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  holds it out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: here's the key...... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, yeah...... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Hiiiii! Oh, and thats it that's it! That's my key! Thank you!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Pallas, do you know what the password is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: For getting further into Omelas?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Okay, how to help my new friends then... hm... Ah yes! Password! I know half of it!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Can you tell me that half, please?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  pulls out her notebook --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "-Productive eternity"</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  nods to the hybrid. "Thank you, Pallas. I'm afraid I've got to go now. More of my friends are elsewhere and they may need help." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  writes it down in her notebook --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thank you. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues staring at the weird science stuff --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Okay, glad to help... Wait, are you all going so soooooon?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is there any other way you can help us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we're trying to find a friend...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: One of our friends is trapped in here somewhere; we need to help her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  The weird science stuff is best left un-mentioned. It's creepy and gross and ew. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  has recordings of it /all/ &gt;:D --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Uh... I donno! But that can wait, can't it? We can have so much fun here, and I still need to know my new friends better!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  turns invisible and slips away back to the transportaliser, seeing if it will let her out. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  ... The transportalizer won't let her out. It says that there is too high a collection of water, incoming. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  curses in Latin to herself before reappearing near the others. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Warning: too high a collection of water, incoming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: (( Here, have this: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atFf4ofZXCc'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atFf4ofZXCc</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: WHAT. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  wordlessly reequips the KSP spacesuit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  equips her water-breathing mask, bracing for impact. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Ooooh, water? I always loved water! I used to be able to breathe in water! Wanna stay for a while longer, friends?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We really do have to get going.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn it, my breathing thingie si still gunked up with macaroni. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *is ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  hands SJ a spare fishbowl helmet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  puts it on --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: be careful though, it's at low durability...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "But... But why? Your friend can wait."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uncaptchas a duct-tape wallet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Not really, I'm afraid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  attempts to peel some duct tape off of it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Developments have meant hers might be a bit of a time-sensitive case.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  barely manages to tear off a flimsy strip --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "But... you are not gonna stay? After all this waiting? And you got me my key?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How long would you want us to stay for? And is it okay if we rescue EQ, then come back to play with you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  the room starts to rumble, and water starts leaking in from the ceiling. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sticks the tiny piece of duct tape on one of the cracks on the helmet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  it doesn't really improve anything on it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh goody. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the helmet is still watertight, it just can't take too much blunt force before it /will/ crack --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  just sorta stands there, utting the duct tape wallet away --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Well, NO! It won't matter! You just Haaaaave to go find some worthless player, instead of being my friends, HUH?!? I thought players were nice! But No! Players, Nor Denizens are nice at all! Except for me, sit that it?!?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Would you feel better if one of us stayed with you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: You did not just call Hannah worthless, did you? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  The room starts to fill with water faster, and the abomination starts to rattle on its podium. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stares at Pallas, clearly ticked off --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And Pallas, friends have to understand that sometimes, no matter how much you /really/ want to stay and get to know someone, if you made a promise, it's really super important to keep that promise. It's okay to spend time with friends later, after that promise is filled.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Players are such liers! They say that they will be my new friends, and then they just DIE OFF. THAT'S IT. NO TRACE. GONE. They leave, and because everything revolves around then, evrything else leaves as well!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "-And YOU DON'T WANNA BE FRIENDS WITH A "CREATURE" LIKE ME, IS THAT IT?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, maybe you should try protecting them? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas is clearly not listening, and the water has gotten to the point where you can freely swim in it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  gives up on diplomatising and is going swimming. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do we need to destroy the statue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: statue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't remember seeing one ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  points mutely at Pallas. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  mixed up her words whoops. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  The creature then comes to life, tearing itself from its podium, and glares at the players. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "NO NEED."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  doggy-paddles awkwardly... the suit was meant for movement in SPAAAACE, not underwatah... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uses god tier flying powers to boost her really slow swimming speed to get the heck away --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas dives into the water, and starts to swim around. A thing that was built for water, being good at swimming. Who would have guessed? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  draws a Wands card in one hand and Pentacles in the other, shoving the wand through the rune to create a powerful lightning attack she directs at the waterlogged sea creature hybrid… thing. Dammit, her Player has to go to orchestra class! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: AAAAAAAAAA ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unequips the lower half of the suit, keeping the helmet on... there we go, swimming normally now --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aw crap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  takes splash damage from AG's attack... /why the hell would you use electric-type WHILE STANDING IN WATER?!/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  ((Ach... well, I'll get a log for you, I guess... :/ )) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  has electrical resistance. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  /due to continually accidentally electrocuting herself/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  so having made a charm for it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  gets shocked, shorting out her hat-top in the process --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is going to autopilot spam electrical attacks at Pallas. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Also what CP just... actioned. Whilst it does do quite a deal to Pallas, the water is now quite electrified, and Pallas then starts to attack in a fit of rage. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is now at like, 30% hp remaining --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  wholly unconcerned with her teammates, uses more electricity. It worked on Scylla, it'll work here... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: C-Copland! Energy Shield!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uncaptchas a thing of dish soap before getting knoecke out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  a zap-proof shield appears around himself and SJ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  is hurt once again, and turns its attention to AG. You now have a dino-fish after your hide. Good job. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is too knocked out to do any actions, I forgot, do bottles of dish soap sink or float? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  powerslashes the hell out of the dino-fish. hooray for waterproof ink. and I'm pretty sure it'd float... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Uh... sink, I beleive)) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //I guess it depends on how full the bottle is... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  // it's about 3/4 full --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //then it'd probably sink... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit_ [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit_ <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  messages from class to see if it's possible to intangibly shove a bomb into the monster. Because that would probably deal less accidental damage. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas is undecided weither to attack CP or AG first. But considering the fact that CP has a KO'd player, that would be a better use of time. Getting rid of two targets rather than 3. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  and sure... once. I'll allow it once.)) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  fires an exploding disc through the shield, trying to knock Pallas out or at least impair his swimming ability --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit_ <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is perfectly willing to, y'know, electrify everything again. Trying to end this quickly, she takes a bomb in each hand and shoves herself and the bombs as far towards Pallas' heart as she can get by going intangible. Then drops them, letting them regain tangibility without her doing so. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas is stunned right before all that happened. She had no time to react, sadly. As the creature exploades into stuffing, the water drains away. Well, that was quick. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  drops the shield, picking up the KO'd SJ and looking over at Gambit with EXTREME CONFUSION --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit_ <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  phases back in, heading to the transportaliser. "Heal her. Hurry. We need to go." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is still knocked out, 25% hp remaining --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "... I don't appriciate that. At all. Just... please go away. I wanna be alone, now..."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Splash Potion of Greaterest Healing go! followed by a potion of Cure Status Effects --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: .......ugghhhhhhhhh....... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  gets up slowly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hey there... you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ow......... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what the heck was with that shock? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Gambit forgetting ELEMENTARY MOTHERBARKING PHYSICS again, that's all. come on, we gotta get back to the others...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Freaking Gambit... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit_ <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is gone. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  walks slowly towards the transportalizer --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  helps her get to the thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  the soap is still on the ground somewhere in the room --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  what even was the plan with that stuff anyway? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  was going to poison/drown the thing with soapy water? I dunno --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  warps back to the main room --</span><br />
