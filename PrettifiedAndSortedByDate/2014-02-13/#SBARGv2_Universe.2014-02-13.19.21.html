[07:28:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah, ask about it</span><br />
[07:29:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: see if she recognizes it</span><br />
[07:29:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe use that knowledge to help Kat.</span><br />

[07:29:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Either that, or I can keep throwing myself at whatever defenses she has around her heart.</span><br />
[07:29:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: question is, how to contact her... she can get on the memo, but I don't think she told us how to pester /her/.</span><br />
[07:30:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: have you tried double clicking her chumhandle?</span><br />

[07:46:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. we found some really weird organic whatsit at the Katsle yesterday, and wanted to ask her if she recognizes it...</span><br />
[07:46:47] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I see /)</span><br />
[07:46:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and speaking of Kat, she's outside in a containment-field box, currently still bonkers.</span><br />

[07:47:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can you expand the field to add another person if need be?</span><br />

[07:48:22] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Whyy? /)</span><br />
[07:48:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since that was /totally/ what you were about to say</span><br />
[07:48:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah FL, I could do that. though dropping them into and out of it via brushportal is slightly safer...</span><br />
[07:48:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, good Kimura.</span><br />
[07:48:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess if need be, we can do that.</span><br />
[07:48:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: gonna try to Hearty Thing again or something?</span><br />
[07:49:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even though last time, both you and Rob got sucker-punched in the mind's eye when you tried?</span><br />
[07:49:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wanna think of something else before I try to repeatedly break in.</span><br />
[07:49:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because it has a chance to kill me or worse.</span><br />
[07:49:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........what does? O_O</span><br />
[07:50:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: trying to force my way in no matter the cost to me</span><br />
[07:51:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, Kats health is more important then me.</span><br />
[07:54:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, if Fluffy can tell us what that stuff was and something about the machine, we'll probably have a better chance of understanding how to fix Kat.</span><br />
[07:55:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...hell, for all we know, putting her back in the cocoon thingy and plugging it in backwards is how to do it <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />

[08:03:27] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: wha</span><br />
[08:03:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, when I tried doing the Lighty Thing on the pod, the only info I got was that the occupant was /definitely/ human...</span><br />
[08:04:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, so it might be a clone</span><br />
[08:04:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit, we /can't/ rule that out now that I think about it :/</span><br />
[08:05:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and if it is a clone, who made it and where's the real Kat?</span><br />
[08:05:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well, even if it is a clone, it wouldn</span><br />
[08:05:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It wouldn't be right to kill it off.</span><br />
[08:09:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... As a general, you do not kill the person until you know for a fact what happened, yeah.</span><br />
[08:11:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: especially for the fact that even if it's the real Kat, a mercy killing in an attempt to reboot her /may/ end up counting as Just, depending on what happened while she was gone...</span><br />
[08:14:13] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: yeah... normally I would suggest that to rule out the possibilty of a doppleganger... but yeah. Don't wanna risk anything.</span><br />
[08:21:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........YOUTUBE WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO THIS TIME</span><br />
