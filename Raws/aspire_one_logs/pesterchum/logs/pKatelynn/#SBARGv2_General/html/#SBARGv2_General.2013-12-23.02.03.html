[03:13:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I sorta want to be able to use this to highlight parts of Seth's adventure that happened on and offscreen. ➜</span><br />
[03:13:44] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: do that yes</span><br />
[03:15:29] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: that would be interesting to see</span><br />
[03:16:18] <span style="color:#aa557f">CPK: well i wrote up a giant textwall of pretty much what a pk refrenced level would be</span><br />
[03:16:26] <span style="color:#aa557f">CPK: complete madness</span><br />
[03:16:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, this will probably take forever and a half to work on. ➜</span><br />
[03:17:14] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... well, it depends on the game style, how many levels you want, and what other things you want added.</span><br />
[03:17:59] <span style="color:#aa557f">CPK: if she does "Can you get it" that will be most of the game coding probally</span><br />
[03:18:39] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: (finally something I may be able to help on!) But yeah... The general construction should be simple enough... I'd need to figure out text-boxes, but thats just a quick trip to google.</span><br />
[03:18:41] <span style="color:#aa557f">CPK: that's what i named the PK baed level</span><br />
[03:19:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll probably be made in game maker studio ➜</span><br />
[03:19:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *it'll ➜</span><br />

[03:19:31] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey, that's what I used to make the pcaketblocker game ➜</span><br />
[03:19:57] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm... Fair enough. It's a quick way to make games, I'll give you that.</span><br />
[03:20:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I've made platformers before in that program. ➜</span><br />
[03:20:20] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True...</span><br />
[03:20:21] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (not complete ones, but at least working ones) ➜</span><br />
[03:21:24] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I myself also have had experience with gamemaker. Its nice, but there isnt a whole lot that can be done, above  stuff like platformers.</span><br />
[03:21:34] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But it is simple and easy to use.</span><br />
[03:21:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but there's options for plugins ➜</span><br />
