[14:14:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: CEA: But yeah, anything involving multiple unnecesary operations at the same time is something I'll be doing my damnedest to block.  CVD: I was wondering why a few things changed with the server. CEA: Also no offense, but I'm not particularly inclined to help EZ anyway. Bit of a whiny bitch, he is.  CVD: You've got a tendency to avoid saying grievances you have with people to their face, don't you</span><br />
[14:14:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">FL: ? CEA: Case in point: 2 days ago when he complained and whined to try and get me to edit his 17 implemented items despite me not knowing anything about the affinities/effects system and having said so multiple times, rather than taking 10 seconds to send a PM to the actual moderator. CEA: Also: Yes. I find it helps avoid conflict.</span><br />
