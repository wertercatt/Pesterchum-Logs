<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, considering the session diameter is... wait, how big are lands again? ok, let's say an upper bound of Earth-to-the-Moon distance from one edge of the Veil to the other (just over one light-second)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (it's probably way less, but for math reasons let's say it's a light-second)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The diameter of a land is about that of a large city.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: your missing the point its dangerus to use warp drive in a star system</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: its warping space</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: interesting idea, though. what happens if you warp-drive in the Furthest Ring, with no actual spacetime?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: well its not space time as far as miving space around you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you consider the trolls a warhammer 40k clone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: if the ring has no space time then how can you travle through it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not that it has no space time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: NO FL we are not dealing with the warp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its that it doesn't operate normally out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I don't think it /doesn't/ have space time, its just that the rules for those things out there are completely different</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, like that one Enterprise episode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: plus we dont have an emperror to guide us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *ok, it doesn't have MATHEMATICALLY COMPREHENSIBLE spacetime.</span><br />
