<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (but there's no rule saying you can't submit your own quotes, so...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I will not be immortalized. Daisoujou is unpleased.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (........and I'm still trying to figure out who you are, ID...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: DD/CC/MM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Isn't my Aura of Shittiness(tm) enough of a giveaway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: it could be mistaken for others</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I could tell who you were by a combination of text coor, personality traits, and references known. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *color ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So I'm that shallow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no, just distinctive ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I never asked for this sadness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I'm going to drink myself into an alcoholic depression, which is ironic, considering why I started in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it might be more that I'm good at figuring stuff out/ I've been here for 5 ever and remember almost everyone or something  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: the latter seems more feasible</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMM</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So who remembers who Bonerfart was?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember the name, not exactly who the name was given to. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing it was MM? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: No, MM was the irrelevant one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I think it was the Imp that backstabbed DD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, that thing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, have you read the actually updated improved infopage yet? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: The one in the memo greeting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Sure did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so you know about the new universe stuff and who runs the place? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: You, FA, and Kaylen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: NN is an admin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. (just as a note, I'm the most leniant of the bunch and usually don't make that many huge descisions) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: I gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: my role is mostly as welcome wagon, canon consultant, and watching over the IC memos. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, tonight's slow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So why do we have a time for Vanilla Earth? IIRC, that's the one that got METEOR'D, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Or is that another Earth because you can never have too many Earths?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because most people use the old time system for reference. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: considering starter planet has a 26 hour day. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Oh, I getcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because everyone is still hardwired for a 24-hour day</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So no humans on the Starter Planet yet, I'm guessing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: besides the players, and visitors from other sessions, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: In that case, I suppose Oy Vey's coming back!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (also SJ's bro, being a non-player technically)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (also wat)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: shekelSearcher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: remember, the sylph of life? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I know who.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: The redundant one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I mean "wat" as in "wasn't he killed in the reckoning or something"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was generally accepted that he and that GnG guy ran off to have adventures together. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: My headcanon for him is that he has the most overpowered Classpect that isn't a double tier, in terms of "FUCK WHY ISN'T THIS GUY DYING".</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So yeah, he's back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: And before you ask, he's worthless at fighting, so he's not TOO overpowered...right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it sounds alright. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: So he's a White Mage with hollow bones and on magical steroids.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa00">CID: Anyway, bedtime for ID. Sweet dreams baybeeeeeees.</span><br />

<span style="color:#d40e00">CMM: I have no idea who he even is</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he was the guy that was responsible for the "orbital mute laser"(read as: NN attempting to mute the memo because this person didn't seem to want to be kicked) during the final chronos battle. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he said some fairly nasty stuff and was banned from the memos. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he only got back on because of an alt and most likely a proxy. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........wait, he was responsible for that? I thought Noodles' attempted shenans were...</span><br />
