[07:37:55] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: actually that could work if you surprise him</span><br />
[07:38:29] <span style="color:#eab800">CCG: All I would have to is get clsoe enough and scare play a big note to possibly distract him.</span><br />
[07:38:41] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
[07:38:49] <span style="color:#eab800">CCG: Then if he chases after me I could lead him somewhere.</span><br />
