<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, I'm starting to wonder if anything is even hapening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Not Really... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I'm just working on some land and lore quests</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ever since aspects were revealed, I've been having the inkling feeling that I haven't even explored half of the important places on my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Uh Huh... you are space right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#970025">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, what he said</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ah, sorry....</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Which begs the question what, you think you need to tap into it to explore certain areas?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I think we need another survey, or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Good luck SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I heard NN was working on something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I got Mind and I've been experimentally trying to, Iunno, do any kind of funky stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: For Me, tapping into my aspect is... difficult.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Nothing so far.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I think the problem is that we don't know HOW we are susspose to handle it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Maybe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Also, thats good to hear, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: For Mind, I would try not doing things taht effect the outside world, put rather your preception of them, RS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Matters of perception, right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: So I just need to</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: turn my view</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: turnways</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: maybe jiggle it a little from side to side</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like, for example, how much X does something need in order to X.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: how much space do i need in order to carry on with this dumb idea that's probably more effort then its worth...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Oh wait that's all of them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Maybe ya just need to focus it like Amadeus Cho.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm willing to bet there's some dungeons that can only be accessed in certain time periods, kinda like in Oracle of Ages and a couple other Zelda games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Here's a good example, RS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF:  <a href='http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/123873/2766366-cho08.jpg'>http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/123873/2766366-cho08.jpg</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: How about you, SJ? Been able to make time ya bitch, yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but I know it's going to happen eventually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Huh. Thats Good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I made a journal post about it a couple days ago</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Guess you could say its inevitable</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Yeah, Time hero to be sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ah. Okay, Sorry, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's all cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Been Kind of lazy and busy.</span><br />
