[06:37] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 GGV2 BASEMENT.</span><br />
[06:38] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0078f0">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:38] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  is holding the bit of his hand that he just cut. --</span><br />
[06:38] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  slowly begins to draw a circle. --</span><br />
[06:40] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  starts making a five pointed star, and begins to place random objects in it. --</span><br />
[06:40] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  comes downstairs --</span><br />
[06:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, what are you doing.</span><br />
[06:40] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // Some Cheese. A doll. A heart. A Touhou CD. and- --</span><br />
[06:41] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  looks up from the circle of his own blood --</span><br />
[06:41] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...ummmm</span><br />
[06:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, no. this isn't gonna do anything.</span><br />
[06:42] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: How do you know.</span><br />
[06:42] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  slowly sets a miniature scythe down. --</span><br />
[06:42] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  scribbles over the drawing, removing the ink/blood --</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  // the blood is removed. --</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because she died on game terms.</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I don't give a fuck if it was game terms or not, she is coming /back/</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you want to revive her, it's /only/ going to be possible on game terms.</span><br />
[06:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:45] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So be it.</span><br />
[06:45] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I'll collect her body and head to a barren wasteland of a planet, and launch a new instance of the game.</span><br />
[06:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and prototype her?</span><br />
[06:46] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I will steal a meteor, and bring her new form back through the portal.</span><br />
[06:46] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...yeah, that /is/ the plan.</span><br />
[06:47] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[06:47] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I don't know how the game would react to someone who has already ascended beginning a new session... but at least I'll be able to bring her back.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...But I would need someone's help to prevent complete disaster.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um... actually... it'd react how Chronos happened, if I read the Pre-Scratch stuff correctly.</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...So I would have to convince some non players to start up the game instead.</span><br />
[06:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. you'd have to somehow get her single-tier-prototyped without being a player or entering the game yourself.</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: No, I could enter the game as a guardian of sorts.</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: After all, Niki's brother Jake survived.</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So it means that myth is busted.</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I mean for safety reasons of you having been a player before... but then again...</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0078f0">[CFL]</span>  realizes that the slight wound he has made has closed up, and his ruby necklace is glowing slightly. --</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...Oh. Its... working again.</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh. mmk</span><br />
[06:58] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads back upstairs --</span><br />
[07:57] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
