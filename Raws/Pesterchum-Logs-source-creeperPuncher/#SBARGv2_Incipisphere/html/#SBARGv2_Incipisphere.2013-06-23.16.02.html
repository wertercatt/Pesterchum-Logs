<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: kids and fun. 'nuff said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Well, I suppose it isn't really needed anyways at the moment. We've got some good group cohesiveness already, and even if that was Chronos he's still one entity struggling against a team of teams!</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF:  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nSOp6B4WL8'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nSOp6B4WL8</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I was gonna die after TT, but then TT is gonna die last, so... I'm dying first?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: WHAT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: What is this about dying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: why is there dying being emntioned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: i thought half of tt was dying first then you? idk chronos is stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, he said that he was gonna kill TT first, then me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: let us mention no more of that please</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Agreed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: .........</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: what the flying fucka re you folks talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: I do suppose, out of anyone, Chronos will try to kill me first.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then he said he was gonna half kill TT later on, which I guess bumped me up on the list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: what does .5st even mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, she will be dying 21.5st, 31.5st, or so on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, the st only goes after a one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: skipping eleven.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: as in first</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Twenty-first and a half.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I would not vie for the position of being placed in a list of who is to be killed, neither would I place much stock in that portion of Chronos's speech</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Thirty-first and a half.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, TT might be dying One Hundred First and a half.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Etc, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: At the time, he seemed to be growing aggravated from the lack of respect he felt was due to him as a demon of space/time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Look, if hes gonna kill me first, I'm taking him down with me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: how do you plan to do that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: End of story.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my boots can change their mass... so I'll raise them to mini black hole level.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: You will not be dying at all if I have anything to say in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And at the same time Ornis</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The warping of timespace might prevent use of his powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: you will ensure that you do not throw yourselves into any positions of possible sacrifice at the same time, yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And, if worse comes to worse, I can throw the boots at him and use the gravity fielder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: I cannot promise that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, lets just try to Telefrag him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With bricks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: LOTS AND LOTS OF BRICKS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: My Plan is simple. P.O.K.E him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: p.o.k.e.?</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: for a second I thought you said telefang</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: "Have you had curry?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Punch of Kill Everything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I had curry once.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, it was made from a Brawl Disc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: My plan is to continue to play the game, work with other players and Ornis in order to coordinate any combined efforts, then at a certain series of times do my part in a larger plan to assault Ornis from several fronts using all of our various tricks rather than rely on a single ace</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You mean chronos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You said Ornis twice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........seriously, this freaking blizzard. soon as it lets up I'm running back to my dwelling spire</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: ...Yeah it was a mistake</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: pff</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Ahem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I meant to say working with Ornis in order to assault Chronos from different fronts</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: I do hope you're not going to assault me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Because, as a demon of space/time</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Attacking him at one causal point would likely be futile</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: EU, you aren't fooling anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: You just said ya planning on attacking FO. hope ya meant Chronos.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Get some bloody sleep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: even though your dreamself is freaking annoying sometimes, you still need some rest sometimes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Sleep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: maybe you could try going to that jamming field area that FL keeps mentioning?</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Thank you, FO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: let me tell you about the jamming field</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: It is unhealthy to stay up so long. I know from experience.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: it cuts off all connetions temporarily while under it, including dreamself connections apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It blocks both electrical and phychic transmissions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#945ba8">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might prevent Chronos from finding us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: that is if he not know of it or it´s not the only place that hiddes us, or else it whould be logical that we where hidding there and he would end up knowig exactly where we where hidding</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its to prevent my denizen from escaping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I'm afraid I can't do that First Guardian. Tis better to ward against the terrors of the night rather than succumb to them, and I have no intentions of ever falling to the starry bastard whose entire ideology and belief system is built on a bunch of sugar-coated lies fed to him over his entire lifespan because he couldn't handle the idea that there were some problems in life you couldn't fix on</span><br />
