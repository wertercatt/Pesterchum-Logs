<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: every time I try to get him to watch it, he refuses to watch it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh, that makes sense.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and yeah another good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: nightmares really? it cant be that scary</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: you guys are just wimps</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: my recommendation would be to have him watch in the morning, so he has all day to calm down from it.</span><br />
