<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A few ounces of what, liquid courage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Courage is just being more afraid of something else than you are of what's in front of you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay Rob liquid courage is slang for alcohol and it ISN'T measured in ounces</span><br />
