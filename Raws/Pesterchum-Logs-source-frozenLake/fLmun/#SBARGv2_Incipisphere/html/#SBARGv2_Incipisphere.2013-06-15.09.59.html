<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: atleast thats what I think will happen if I do this</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ just be careful, mate /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it seems a lot of times this game tries to stress interdependence between players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Its a button</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Good luck then BH. Hopefully you can ally yourself with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: theres a huge table</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: with a button</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess the button activates the heaters</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: here goes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: definetely activated the heaters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the ice is melting </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Uuuh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess the Denizen is still asleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just wondering, last night when I was flying the heck away from stuff, I accidentally forgot to give you the thing I snagged out of that pyraxis thing. I can't tell what it's supposed to be for some reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think I might have figured that out</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: keep it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still doesn't answer my question on what it's supposed to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: its a bomb that goes off when its in a certain proximity of my Denizen as well as at a certain heat</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The consorts said such an item should have been found there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: That must be why the Denizen isn't awake</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Well, I guess its time to go down and see what this place is like without all the ice obscuring shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so, SJ. Destroy it or save it incase we can use it for something later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Your safe from it exploding, just to be clear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess this turned out well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I don't have to fight the Denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and I get to explore my land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: at this point it doesn't really make since to call it LOCAG</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: I guess so. Some of the books collected yestrday have also proven to be useful in my research. So theres that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I wonder if there are any cave-consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: frozen in time</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((who wants to see a drawing thign))</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((thankies))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: You know whats wierd though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I can't find my frozen denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so he must be free</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and yet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Everything seems peaceful</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh... If hes free, and made of gas, there is a chance you might have inhaled a little bit of him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ew</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe he got stuck in the atmosphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe he's awake and he just can't come down</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: also, some consorts have been telling me something interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what are they whispering now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: apparantely, the Denizen's palace is vacant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Which would make since</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because the Denizen is trapped in the atmosphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I kind of want to see whats in it, if its not the Denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Careful, there might be an "ink" effect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe we'll find something that will help us to hunt down the imposter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ink effect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Whyy' this memo suddenlyy filled with kids wanting to go after their denizens oh myy god... /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: i'm not going after my Denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I just want to go into his palace</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: since its vacant anyway</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TT could explain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the Denizen can't re enter it once he leaves.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2"> AG: Where're the other ones, FA?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because he just rises</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: waiτ whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: he's a gas</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: a map</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Its of the incipisphere and I think we can probabely use it at a later date</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: cool, keep in touch I guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I also found another bomb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Its looks kind of like the one SJ had</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but I think it serves a different purpose.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but it looks pretty much exactly like the one SJ had</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: odd...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Who knows? Maybe its a part of Skaia's plan to stop the imposter.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: well I dunno</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, its RAINING on my land.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure I could incorperate them into the IPS.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I'm tempted to crack it open and see whats inside it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but if I do that we might not be able to use it later</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure the scan visor function would be able to tell me about it without the risk of it exploding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like what would happen if you CRACKED IT OPEN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: FL, let me do my own research on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the consorts might be able to help</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and so will the library in the Denizen's palace</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: BH, don't you dare try to rip it open.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I'm going to see if I can find anything on it </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The Denizen has a HUGE library</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Does it now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: understandable, since he was once the gaurdian of LOCAG history</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL, I doubt that thing is that powerful. At most it'll probably only blow up a room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I found something on the incipisphere and types of sessions</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: its like the one is porspit's library</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but its volume 5</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what does that mean then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Another library... I might be traveling over to your land quite a bit then. I need lots of information. As much as I can get.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I wonder if it can tell us about glitched sessions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The las t volume that Prospit had was 4</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the table of contents has Glitched Sessions</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: thats</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and the Glitched Sessions section has something on bombs and there connection to space players</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: um...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Clio likes history if he managed to get a copy of this</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the denizen just so happens to have a book that has information on glitched sessions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: He has all the books</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: all 5 volumes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: bh i only as that you read whatever it has to say with caution</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and thousands of other books</span><br />
