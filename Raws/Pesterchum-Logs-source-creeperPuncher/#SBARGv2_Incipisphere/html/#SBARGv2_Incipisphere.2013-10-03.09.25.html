<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Guess so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't know man I can't tell you what weapon's best in your hands, only you can. Just, make it your own.</span><br />

<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: hey fl i figured i should invite you to my planet for a dungeon crawl</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: since you got here late and probably missed the e-vite</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: a /furby/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ehhhh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not really in the mood for dungeons</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((._.;;;;;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: okay!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Personally, I would perfer to just... kick back, maybe spend some of this insane ammount of grist</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and recycle everything when Ash is ready with the frog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so we can /finally do/ the ultimate alchemy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the other combo makes a portable replicator</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not alchemiter, /replicator/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........did you just say you made a furby?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( the ones that leech the life and color from everything around them? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, it's kind of an in-joke that prolonged breaches of the fourth wall release the Evil Monster Furbies into both worlds))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I decided to set it on fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( /good/ ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its screaming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((phew))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hopefully it's not lava-proof or something ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: naw, it /was/ melting</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just wanna speed up the process</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: send it to a Dead Land.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll put it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and send it to chaos</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I should have sent it backwards in time to chronos, but... eh, its not like those devices can break from the alpha</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (seriously though if I had done that, chronos would be killing me /now/)</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (and see if I can trick the two into killing eachother)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (that would be crazy dangerous, but might just work) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (which is why it wouldn't)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (logicly we would need to kill chronos in a way that would /never/ work)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (why are we whispering) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no idea</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it might be a good idea to make a bigger world map</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, if she isn't a teen now</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: imagine her /later/</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does this have anything to do with pesterchum cutting out for a millisecond?</span><br />

<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: are you part cybernetic or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ..do you think it has something to do with that furby? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All I was doing was browsing the web!</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: flash player crashed you? well fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: doesn't seem like a thing that would be harmful... then again, cookie clicker... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and tvtropes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: about 5 tabs of tv tropes</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok fl speaking as someone who also uses a neural interface</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: cookie clicker is probably what crashed you</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thanks SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, CP might have been right</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah, that was also a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why would you even run videos on a neural interface</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just gives me a headache</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: man, even THINKING about that is giving /me/ a headache...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no you dont</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: text only bro</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: even without the risk of crashing thats just confusing and dumb</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: even 4chan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cause personally I drank brainbleach after my brain viewed it right after going godtier</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fuck pants</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sorry I'm not a youngster with an obsession with shorts :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: Hearts are red...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: heart as an aspect, fuzz</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god its the fuzz</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: Oh! r-right you're a....a heart...person, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: uhm....hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hearts are burgundy~</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a new theory when it comes to rogues</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rogues trade (with) aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: w-well....AG and the Commander...i asked them...about the whole title thing and....and what they think...i might be? th-they said...something about hearts and...minds...as...aspects? right? those are aspects and the other part's uhm....shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, they steal from people, and give to others</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sounds kinda like trading</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: like robin hood?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where as, I trade souls?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or even, trade my own soul for something else?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would make sense with my power set</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: do uhm.....do you know a lot about other kinds of heart people?</span><br />

<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, a bard invites destruction of/using aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and a page masters (with) aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: commander said he thinks...uhm...hold on lemme check</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: "page of heart" or....."seer of mind" maybe....AG said maybe bard of either...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heirs and Pages are classes about growing up I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Possibly/probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That sounds about right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While an heir becomes their aspect, a page masters it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb984">CIA: ...masters?</span><br />
