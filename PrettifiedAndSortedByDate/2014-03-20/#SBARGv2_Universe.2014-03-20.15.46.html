[17:45:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I only usually read the first 2 words of whatever Charles says</span><br />
[17:46:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's simpler that way</span><br />
[17:46:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh wait I forgot to add random bouts of democracy and anarchy</span><br />
[17:46:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But Anyhoo, been catching up on reading. Interesting stuff in here.</span><br />
[17:47:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://twitchshoutspokemon.nodejitsu.com/'>http://twitchshoutspokemon.nodejitsu.com/</a></span><br />
[17:47:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Neat</span><br />
[17:48:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its gonna get louder in a Starter Planet Day.</span><br />
[17:49:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, Emerald starts?</span><br />
[17:49:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[17:49:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also! I'm hunting through Space for Miss Universe McSplodes.</span><br />
[17:50:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What, you /actually/ think she can pull it off?</span><br />
[17:51:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, stupid question</span><br />
[17:51:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: From the looks of it, yes.</span><br />
[17:51:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, maybe.</span><br />
[17:51:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's she up to right now?</span><br />
[17:51:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no idea! I'm only a tracker on land.</span><br />
[17:52:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, to get to full universe exploding mastery, she would need to absorb the powers of a void player to spawn in... oh fuck nuggets</span><br />
[17:52:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No Charles, no explosions.</span><br />
[17:52:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nobody is as big a munchkin as you.</span><br />
[17:52:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...tell me she's not a Voider.</span><br />
[17:52:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not even someone that wants to fully destroy the universe?</span><br />
[17:52:53] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But all I found is some coordinates and some myth.</span><br />
[17:53:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not.</span><br />
[17:53:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: A munchkin doesn't have determination </span><br />
[17:53:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not a Voider either right now, I'm just not a Seer.</span><br />

[17:54:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[17:54:33] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Whoops</span><br />
[17:54:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it doesn't take a munchkin to think that antimatter would be good to blow shit up.</span><br />
[17:54:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Imagine trying to find a single fish in an endless ocean</span><br />
[17:55:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((btw, PA's dragon-dance thing made perfect sense after watching Book3Ep13 last night :P))</span><br />
[17:55:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm just trying to find where the fish come from</span><br />
[17:55:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, she said she was from an Earth, from a universe neither this one nor our old one...</span><br />
[17:55:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Siiiiic }</span><br />
[17:56:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, which is where I was sorta looking</span><br />
[17:56:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You think she could be pre scratch?</span><br />
[17:56:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Instead I just jumped around a bunch of boring myth classes in random universities</span><br />
[17:57:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I highly doubt she could be from Beta Earth...</span><br />
[17:57:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You ever had a history lesson with a bunch of geeky aliens? Not fun.</span><br />
[17:57:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But she might be, and I know where to find more!</span><br />
[17:58:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[17:58:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
[17:58:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay where are these aliens</span><br />
[17:58:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, not Beta Earth.</span><br />
[17:58:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: In space.</span><br />
[17:58:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[17:58:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, what are we looking for now?</span><br />
[17:58:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I wanna learn about history and stuff... since it would be new to me!</span><br />
[17:59:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean more information before the Earth thing</span><br />
[17:59:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We're looking for....FOR</span><br />
[17:59:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: A....A...</span><br />
[17:59:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Library.</span><br />
[17:59:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now excuse me as I try and see about making the Dakkagun.</span><br />
[18:00:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I guess if you find a planet with a school you can learn history Charles</span><br />
[18:00:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...gonna have to ask Gambit probably, she seems to have lockdown on all the library-planets' locations.</span><br />
[18:01:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good idea. Maybe.</span><br />
[18:01:23] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably.</span><br />
[18:01:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm currently thinking it would be some sort of Electromagnetic Rifle that would use the power from a golden hub to accelerate several metal slugs to relativistic speeds.</span><br />
[18:01:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Voiders are always so weird, I hate relying on them.</span><br />
[18:01:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, an Electromagnetic Chain Gun.</span><br />
[18:02:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's...actually a cool idea.</span><br />
[18:02:10] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: are we using the same laws of physics here</span><br />
[18:02:16] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: golden hub</span><br />
[18:02:20] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: what the fuck are you on about</span><br />
[18:02:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But yeah, I might have a lead on the Library to investigate</span><br />
[18:02:49] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: it sounds cool and all but the energy required to accelerate mass to relativistic speeds is just stupid</span><br />
[18:03:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh.</span><br />
[18:03:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Since MP was sleuthing and like, ragequit.</span><br />
[18:03:17] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: and like. a waste. not worthwhile at that point, considering guns are pretty much 'rooty tooty point and shooty' at this point</span><br />
[18:03:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just think like a Rail Gun thats combined with a Chain Gun.</span><br />
[18:03:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Guns are still cool, I'm proud of Charles for not being a huge loser.</span><br />
[18:04:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, since /supposedly/ magic and powers don't work on this Cal lady, we are gonna need to hit her fast and hard with something solid.</span><br />
[18:04:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Rock Beats Laser, basically?</span><br />
[18:04:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Shit, all the snowflakes from the session are screwed :v</span><br />
[18:04:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does anyone have any depleted uranium?</span><br />
[18:05:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Oddly enough, yeah</span><br />
[18:05:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........wat.</span><br />
[18:05:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have some leftover from the bee farms</span><br />
[18:05:30] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: have any of you nerds even used actual magic yet</span><br />
[18:05:57] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: like, against her</span><br />
[18:05:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have indeed. Not my cup of tea.</span><br />
[18:06:02] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: or just like your nonsense game powers.</span><br />
[18:06:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh not against her. We saw her like once though so</span><br />
[18:06:22] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Didn't test a lot.</span><br />
[18:06:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I tried a few brush techniques, which are technically legit magic... she shrugged them all off.</span><br />
[18:06:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats divine, not arcane.</span><br />
[18:06:42] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: so it's deriving power from your mana, yes?</span><br />
[18:07:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mana, ink pots, flower points, they're all the same stat basically.</span><br />
[18:07:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm mildly proud of being a Spacer and not actually using that many powers.</span><br />
[18:08:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((afk walking dog))</span><br />
[18:09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I highly doubt that even the STRONGEST person in our session would be able to carry such a weapon however.</span><br />
[18:09:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But if we find anything in this library hell it could at least tell us how she's gonna do it.</span><br />
[18:10:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean most people don't say they're gonna destroy anything without a plan</span><br />
[18:10:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, you can look for this library then, I'll be getting this thing built. Maybe it can be a tank or something.</span><br />
[18:10:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or better yet, a fucking METAL GEAR.</span><br />
[18:11:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Try the tank</span><br />
[18:11:20] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: all the same shit?</span><br />
[18:11:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you'll think of something original</span><br />
[18:11:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((back))</span><br />
[18:11:28] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: sure, if you want to get your ass beat by an actual wizard</span><br />
[18:11:41] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: and have no counters to, y'know, people that derive energy from mana</span><br />
[18:11:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Bipedial doesn't really work to well.</span><br />
[18:11:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: too*</span><br />
[18:11:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Unless Rob does it</span><br />
[18:12:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Y'know</span><br />
[18:12:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, two legged machines usually have the problem of toppling over.</span><br />
[18:12:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I wonder if I need a library card</span><br />
[18:12:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or if I just have to walk in</span><br />
[18:13:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps a more spider tank would work better.</span><br />
[18:13:16] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: spider tank? sounds cool</span><br />
[18:13:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Those are the coolest</span><br />
[18:14:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I built a few lego robots when I was younger and the six-legged design is pretty stable if you do it right...</span><br />
[18:14:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually seen those in some planet's militaries</span><br />
[18:14:34] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Super creepy at higher speeds though ;;</span><br />
[18:15:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: question is, would I be able to get it to get where it needs to go?</span><br />
[18:15:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I /could/ try and see about finding the specs for some sort of jump drive.</span><br />
[18:16:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Jump as in, space travel?</span><br />
[18:17:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah. Like, teleportation based.</span><br />
[18:18:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Huh. Usually tanks don't have those at all.</span><br />
[18:18:43] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most people just use carriers or vtols.</span><br />
[18:19:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Smaller ships drop the tanks off I mean.</span><br />
[18:26:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, whoooo wants to go exploring!</span><br />
[18:26:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heck yes I'm in</span><br />
[18:27:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: heck no I'm out</span><br />
[18:27:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why not FL?</span><br />
[18:27:54] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We might need a tank</span><br />
[18:28:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not going to go /exploring/.</span><br />
[18:28:23] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why not?</span><br />
[18:28:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, with my luck you would just awake /another/ ancient horror.</span><br />
[18:28:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I'm staying behind so you can't blame it on me.</span><br />
[18:28:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bleh... I see your logic.</span><br />
[18:29:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Did anybody ever blame you?</span><br />
[18:29:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually technically no.</span><br />
[18:29:34] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I thought you were easily the smarted one in the room</span><br />
[18:29:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Your paranoia was totally founded for once</span><br />
[18:30:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That could ACTUALLY be a useful exploring quality so we don't release anymore.</span><br />
[18:30:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which makes me a perfect target for paradox space to go after if it wants me dead.</span><br />
[18:30:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I'm starting to think it does.</span><br />
[18:30:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Little bit too paranoid but good effort.</span><br />
[18:31:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I need to stay back and make sure its completed.</span><br />
[18:31:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: If it wants you dead it'd have killed you by now, I think.</span><br />
[18:31:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Tank, I mean.</span><br />
[18:31:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ah. Well obviously not exploring tonight</span><br />
[18:32:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or the MRFRG for short.</span><br />
