[07:47:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[07:47:34] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *appears out of nowhere!*</span><br />
[07:47:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[07:48:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  You are standing on a platform above a large graveyard-like area. Multicolored glowing clouds blow  about lazily like a fog. On the ground, zombies, skeletons, and other "halloween-y" creatures roam, they cannot reach the platform. --</span><br />
[07:48:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  The creatures are /everywhere/ --</span><br />
[07:48:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ZkRDgKoaw'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ZkRDgKoaw</a> --</span><br />
[07:49:52] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so yeah, this is the place</span><br />
[07:50:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT adorableSlayer <span style="color:#be00be">[CAS]</span>  already has her 6 carapace swords drawn --</span><br />
[07:51:02] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has Requiem for a Whiplash and User's Revenge both ready to fire --</span><br />
[07:51:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has a deck of cards and is grinning like mad*</span><br />
[07:51:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the enemies go down to pretty much anything, but they can swarm you if you aren't careful</span><br />
[07:52:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Let 'em..</span><br />
[07:52:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: They'll just die en masse!</span><br />
[07:52:23] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: if one has a pot on its back, theres a weapon or item in there you get if you kill it. i dont know how or why.</span><br />
[07:52:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Really/?! /Awesome/! It's like a murderous treasure hunt!</span><br />
[07:52:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but most of them dont, so theyre only good for grist.</span><br />
[07:52:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: sweet, sweet, grist.</span><br />
[07:52:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: free loot either way :D</span><br />
[07:53:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Midair calculus and treasure murder-hunts.</span><br />
[07:53:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: This place is… I /love/ this Game.</span><br />
[07:53:24] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: still, though, i can see why this land is abandoned</span><br />
[07:53:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: if i entered this place as soon as i entered, theres no way i would have survived for more than a few minutes</span><br />
[07:55:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah...</span><br />
[07:55:19] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: also: dont take items from enemies somebody else killed. theres plenty to go around, and i really dont want this to turn into a childish argument about who gets what</span><br />
[07:55:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you kill it, you get it.</span><br />
[07:56:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *stares at him blankly* /Obviously/.</span><br />
[07:56:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: just wanted to make sure</span><br />
[07:56:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  sideeyes ag --</span><br />
[07:56:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *offended*</span><br />
[07:56:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[07:57:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: anyway, go wild</span><br />
[07:57:55] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *launches herself down off the platform at the nearest enemies, somehow midair-summoning a demonic bicycle and managing to fling herself onto its back*</span><br />
[08:00:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts firing jawbreakers at a group of skeletons coincidentally arranged in a bowling formation --</span><br />
[08:00:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  leaps down, swinging his Bionic Arm in a circle --</span><br />
[08:00:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((required listening: <a href='http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=47Y97lo4ve8'>http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=47Y97lo4ve8</a> ))</span><br />
[08:01:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT adorableSlayer <span style="color:#be00be">[CAS]</span>  leaps down, a whirlwind of blades, into a cluster of zombies --</span><br />
[08:03:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has drawn a black butterfly knife with a blade that almost looks like it's dripping, and another with a blade made out of what could easily be ice, and rides her demonbike into a cluster of enemies, slashing at anything that comes near her and letting her bike take out anything that gets near /it/*</span><br />
[08:06:23] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((you get to decide whats in the pots btw, this gives you an excuse to have that crazy weapon you couldnt figure out a believable alchemy formula for))</span><br />
[08:09:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh, sweet</span><br />
[08:09:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: hey guys1</span><br />
[08:09:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: *!</span><br />
[08:09:43] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: found a cave over here</span><br />
[08:09:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[08:09:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the donjons here are pretty small, but they usually have good loot</span><br />
[08:10:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  collects the dropped grist and Ultra Bone Hammer, then runs over --</span><br />
[08:11:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: enemies never respawn here, either, the enemies that are there never leave and don't respawn when they die</span><br />
[08:12:35] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So anything in there is for killing?</span><br />
[08:13:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah, they dont drop loot though</span><br />
[08:13:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay, got it!</span><br />
[08:13:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: theres usually a chest at the end with something sweet though</span><br />
[08:13:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Everything in the cave is for killing, even if it doesn't loot-drop.</span><br />
[08:13:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Let's /do this thing/.</span><br />
[08:13:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yep</span><br />
[08:14:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *gets her demoncycle to turn and kicks it towards the entrance to the cave*</span><br />
[08:14:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  Gambit rides over a tripwire, causing a dagger to fly  out of  the wall. Fortunately, she was too fast  to be hit --</span><br />
[08:14:39] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: what</span><br />
[08:14:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats uh</span><br />
[08:14:48] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: thats new</span><br />
[08:14:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ponders how a rosary made of 12 jawbreakers can fire so many more than that, then shrugs and follows the others inside-- whoa traps --</span><br />
[08:15:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe this is some special donjon</span><br />
[08:15:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...there are also usually enemies attacking by now</span><br />
[08:16:20] <span style="color:#be00be">CAS: I don't remem8er ever coming in this cave, either...</span><br />
[08:16:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok, just keep close</span><br />
[08:16:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  rolls for Detect Traps... and by that I mean does the Lighty Thing to illuminate any tripwires or other things --</span><br />
[08:18:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#887000">[CSL]</span>  Holy shit, there's tripwires and pressure plates everywhere. They are all linked to various launchers that fire knives out of the floor, walls, and ceiling... hot damn that's a  lot of knives. --</span><br />
[08:18:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: All right, don't worry, I'll just murderalise anything that moves.</span><br />
