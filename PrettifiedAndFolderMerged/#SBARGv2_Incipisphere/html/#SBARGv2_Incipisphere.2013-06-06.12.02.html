<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi EU</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Blue Hole? Honestly, I have no idea beyond just cleaning up the rest of the session and hoping that chokes it to metaphorical death</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Glad to see everyone's submitting bug reports, though I still stand by my opinion that</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It'd be easier to list what wasn't screwed up in this session</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...basic alchem- wait, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alchemy is completely unbalanced.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_LoIaR'>#SBARGv2_LoIaR</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And it's rather easy for me to extrapolate the code for an object.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Anyone know the code for a snow golem from minecraft?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: If anyone wants to jo▓n training, I'm up for a frien▓ly spar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wanna use the recipe modus with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ooh, that sounds like fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I might be able to snap a pic and get it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll be there... to make sure no one gets injured.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Like I'd want to hurt any of you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wasn't saying that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: What is the status of your Land connections and cross-Land travel, if I may ask?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just figure some one IS going to get hurt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, its been forever since I've played singleplayer on this map...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: EU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: That stuff is dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: We've been stuck mostly going back and forth between a three-Land system, no transportalizers outwards</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Try making some wings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Did someone create a space elevator?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Like, if anyone ne▓ds a ride to another land. Ju▓t t░l me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: tell*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I'll pick 'm up later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh my</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I had not thought of the possibilities of outwardly mobile flight</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alternatively, if anyone needs a ride I'm always game too</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Your mind gets dulled when you've been welding pieces of glass to create slightly larger pieces of glass together for six hours</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: W're just trippin' options</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either your being sarcastic, and you can't use wings for some reason, or your- I'll shut up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Yea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I ship RS.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Don't even.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I found some snow and some pumpkins.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: was a little easy since I already had them on this old map</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Are you talking about Minecraft?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: somebody said they wanted a snow golem, so I'm going to use my digital camera modus to capture one</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: freaking spiders</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Just be cautious you don't end up with a Headless Snowman or something like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Okay it looks like with some tinkering with an Enlarger, this might work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: freaking biome changes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this map is so old that there's snow biome stuff where it's now marked as a desert biome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and now it's an ocean biome where there's a forest.</span><br />
