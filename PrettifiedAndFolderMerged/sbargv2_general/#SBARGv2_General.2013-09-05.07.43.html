<span style="color:#133295">CEP: How many PP's do we have now? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: pocketed &amp; paperParadox :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and then this pyro :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so that would be three, but am I missing any PPs? :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yo</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hahahaha now I'm remembering pyroTherapist, an old handle I RPed with</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny that</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so many coincidences :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: RS, for some reason, every night I exit pesterchum. And then the next morning, turns out pesterchum was somehow still open but hidden and I don't know it until I open it and it says EP is already taken. So I need to go into task manager and end the pesterchum process, which I thought was already ended last night, but somehow still running. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ._.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Actually, are you clicking the x up in the corner of pesterchum and such?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or whatever the x is depending on your theme?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah. And then going to my taskbar and right clicking and clicking exit. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because that only minimizes it in the tray, doesn't actually close it. To close out of pester you gotta go to the first dropdown menu (again whatever it's called depending on your theme) and go to the last option.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: that's what I do after I minimize the tray :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I go to the taskbar and right click and click exit :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and then it disappears from the taskbar :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and it works sometimes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but then it seems like every night, it ends up still running, despite being unable to tell unless I go to the processes section of task manager. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Okay, this will sound weird, but I can't actually trust my follower count. I can trust the followers, I just mean, the stats that say my count. I think tumblr might be glitching out. Or has been for the last few days. Someone followed me the other day, and then it didn't show in my count that they were following me, but then they said that in their "following" count, that it showed they were followin</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">then I got this email a few minutes ago saying someone started following me, but it doesn't actually show up in the follower count. Nor does it show up in the activity. Just an email. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: like, if it was an unfollow, it would have at least shown up in the activity.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: the original follow :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: that is :&gt;</span><br />
