<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, FF, the story's called "Witch Hunter". It's about what the title suggests. Evil witches waged war on humans and humans fought back. The main character is a really powerful hunter, though he prefers to nearly kill or deplete their energy rather than outright kill them. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Similar to a lot of series, the witch hunters are in teams, except the main character prefers to work solo. What's different is that he doesn't really care as much about protecting his friends as evidence when one of them was possessed by a witch and he decided to shoot anyway. Although subverted in that because of his no kill rule, it was a trainquilizing bullet. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i dont like him as a sexy young man because he wouldnt be hosting community radio if he was</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: me neither but my mom wouldnt shut up about it for a while there</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: East just kinda does whatever she does to cause the most destruction as possible. Which, is evil, but also means she'll help out the good guys if she encourages them to get into a fight. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so its basically the dnd alignment grid</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like she opposes North and South's plans and works to foil them and works with the main character, but also puts him into situations where it would cause him to go evil. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: All the while, she floats by and destroys cities. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, another thing I forgot to mention, FF. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The witches all have one similar power where basically everyone is a summoner :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: With one summon creature :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And the main character is one of the few non witches who has a summon creature companion. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: theres actually a summoning idea ive wanted to see explored</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: which wouldnt fit with your story but i want to get it out there</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, it's not my story, I'm just reading it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But go ahead :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Get it out there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: have final fantasy-style summons where there's like a list that all summoners draw from</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but the summons in question are aware while they are summoned</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: they have to obey whoever summons them because summoning shenanigans</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think that's been done before. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Have you read Fairy Tail? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but they often have knowledge of the other side</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: because both sides are summoning them</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so summoning can be risky because the other guy can go "hey what did you see when they summoned you" and theyre bound to answer truthfully</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: hehe. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: In Witch Hunter, the main character's summon companion is a pumpkin head doll that turns into a loli. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But they both have the same personality. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The pumpkin head wants to beat up anything and everything and only doesn't because it's forced to obey the main character :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So when she goes into loli form, still the same :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i remember there was an anime that i heard about in an article about various japanese interpretations of beelzebub</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: where hes either a penguin or sexy fangirl bait most of the time</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: see ff3j has an overarcing quest to restore the 4 crystals</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but half the stuff you do is completely tangential</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: as in object a is blocking objective b so you need to do quest c which requires item d that you get from donjon e</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: and so on</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: which makes the world feel so much more alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: tbh that's kinda convoluted in a tiresome way</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: the thing with the japanese is that they're a graphomaniac nation</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: and i think that view is why it doesnt happen anymore</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: they like text everywhere</span><br />

<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: parallel storylines, for example</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but modern jrpg worlds feel so player-centered</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think what SL's getting at is stuf that's unrelated to the plot that makes it feel like the plot isn't the only thing that matters. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: whereas stuff like ff3j really gives the impression that there are people and events that would still happen if you werent there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: yeah that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i say this because im playing earthbound and it does the same sort of thing</span><br />
