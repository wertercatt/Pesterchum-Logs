[07:44:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, fine.</span><br />
[07:46:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I disconnected DT after he went behind my back and tryed to prevent Ash from talking to me, he took it the wrong way, used the backup power supply he installed into himself, and flew off with two drones.</span><br />
[07:47:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The drone he transfered into took the brain scan I just made to check DT with, discovering that he was based on a period of time when my dreamself was still alive, alchemized a copy of Revelation 4.13, and flew into the jamming field.</span><br />
[07:48:04] <span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: Someone's learning the Quarian/Geth problem the hard way it looks like</span><br />
[07:48:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The other drone was remote controlled to make the satelite that makes the jamming field, and send it back in time using the sendificators in the veil.</span><br />
[07:49:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And he has adapted his code to be running around a picture of a certain shipping wall.</span><br />
[07:49:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, he is having code pointers point at code pointers IN THE image.</span><br />
[07:50:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we can't take out the satelite, as he will activate revelation if we do.</span><br />

[07:51:09] <span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … What's Revelation?</span><br />
[07:51:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Best case scenario, it wipes out all the computers in the session and we can alchemize more.</span><br />
[07:51:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Worse case, it gets into the fundamental code of the session.</span><br />
[07:51:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So basically the ending of ME3 or some wacked out shite</span><br />

[07:56:39] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: But considering that I don't know the location of said AI, it would be very difficult, and would take /way/ too much time.</span><br />
[07:56:52] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Other AI's could help, but still.</span><br />
[07:57:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...basically, if DT activates Revelation, and it gets into Sburb's source code, THIS ENTIRE MOTHERBARKING SESSION WILL SELF-DESTRUCT.</span><br />
[07:57:15] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: A jamming feild is a good place to hide from a computer.</span><br />

[07:57:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...The jamming field is off center from the south pole.</span><br />
[07:57:37] <span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Well, the others seem to know where the jamming field is, and… what's it jam, anyway?</span><br />

[07:59:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh right, explaining /that/. in Uplink, Revelation is a virus that is meant to destroy the internet by infecting computers and, well, making them self-aware and then self-destruct.</span><br />
[07:59:14] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Can't we have one day without shinaigains?</span><br />
