[03:34:03] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Hm?))</span><br />
[03:34:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( EQ, kinda wondering if anyone made any progress and mentioned it ))</span><br />
[03:34:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Not that I know of, no.))</span><br />
[03:35:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( ...its times like this where I think I should have stuck with the easy puzzle. ))</span><br />
[03:35:48] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Yeaaaah... I know how you feel with that sorta thing.))</span><br />
[03:37:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( SL made a good point though, I do suck at this. ))</span><br />
[03:37:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Eh... its more along the lines what word puzzles and math is easier to solve than stuff involving sound.))</span><br />
[03:37:58] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Theres more of an idea where to go and what to do.))</span><br />
[03:39:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( I found this looking for a phone tone reader on the web. <a href='http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/'>http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/</a> ))</span><br />
[03:39:44] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Huh... I see.))</span><br />
[03:39:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( It doesn't take MP3s, but I bet /someone/ could convert like I did. ))</span><br />
[03:40:29] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Yeah, thats a problem then. You generally dont want a puzzle to depend on ONE webpage, in order for it to be solved. I had no idea that sort of thing existed, until now.))</span><br />
[03:41:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( it is literally the second result for phone tone reader ))</span><br />
[03:41:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( which makes me sad. ))</span><br />
[03:41:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( cuz that might mean noone even googled it. ))</span><br />
[03:42:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Shrug. Like I said, that sorta thing might not always pop-up for some people. Its not showing up when I google phone tone reader, for instance.))</span><br />
[03:42:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( huh. ))</span><br />
[03:43:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( okay time to snark with consortCultist ))</span><br />
[03:43:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( does this work <a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Detect+DTMF+Tones&l=1'>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Detect+DTMF+Tones&l=1</a> ))</span><br />
[03:44:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Mhm. -And have fun.))</span><br />
[03:44:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Actually, on second thought, that might make me come across as an asshole. ))</span><br />
[03:44:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( fuck what to doo... ))</span><br />
[03:45:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Hm... tough one...))</span><br />
[03:47:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Yeah I'm not sure, because people NEED to find that website, but I'm not sure how one would get them to find it, without sounding like a jerk in the process... hm...))</span><br />
[03:47:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( well is EQ looking IC? ))</span><br />
[03:48:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( sorry for suggesting that idea. ))</span><br />
[03:48:26] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((ICly... yes, but she's failing miserably.))</span><br />
[03:51:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( I mean, I could give them the password to get /in/ by itself... somehow, but then a plot hint wouldn't get through. ))</span><br />
[03:51:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Well, two of them. ))</span><br />
[03:52:05] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Yeah... -and theres not much of a way the plot hint can be given, once everyone is inside, right?))</span><br />
[03:52:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Well it might assist to get through the first obstacle. ))</span><br />
[03:52:59] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Hm...))</span><br />
[03:53:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Knowledge is power... ))</span><br />
[03:55:35] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((Well, what can I say? If you need me to be all like: "Oh hey I found a site where you can translate phone sounds" if you wish, but I'd like to think there is a better way to go about this...))</span><br />
[03:56:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Yeah, there likely is... maybe link them to wikipedia with all the tones and stuff. ))</span><br />
[03:57:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((shrug? or give them an easy puzzle, which links to that site, which they can then use?))</span><br />
[03:57:32] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((i'm not so sure.))</span><br />
[03:58:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Well maybe we can put a plan into action after I do some minecraft. See ya later? ))</span><br />
[03:58:53] <span style="color:#2806ea">EQ: ((As long as you tell me what to do, yup. See yah!))</span><br />
