[05:00:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  lands on the other side of the portal --</span><br />
[05:00:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  turns around, waiting for EQ. --</span><br />
[05:01:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:01:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  hops out the other end of the portal, and looks around. --</span><br />
[05:01:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks around as well. --</span><br />
[05:02:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  the land is mostly grey and colorless, aside from the BRIGHT lasers shooting up from the ground here and there. There is a small village of consorts near-by. --</span><br />
[05:02:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...which way?</span><br />
[05:03:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  adjusts his shades --</span><br />
[05:03:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... around now she should be in the village square for... that village there!</span><br />
[05:03:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ah man, still bright.</span><br />
[05:03:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That one?</span><br />
[05:03:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  says pointing to the nearby village. --</span><br />
[05:03:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright...</span><br />
[05:03:44] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm. -and sorry. You get used to the lasers.</span><br />
[05:03:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess...</span><br />
[05:03:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: kinda like flash bombing Gambit...</span><br />
[05:03:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: heh.</span><br />
[05:04:03] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: pff</span><br />
[05:04:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Funny how she can see light but be intangable to it.</span><br />
[05:04:28] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed.</span><br />
[05:04:44] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Anyways, she should not be teaching now... hopefully. You should hurry, just in case.</span><br />
[05:04:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We can just look through a window.</span><br />
[05:04:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right?</span><br />
[05:05:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...does her class room have windows?</span><br />
[05:05:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what does she teach anyway?</span><br />
[05:05:29] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed. You just don't wanna be caught stalking by it, though.</span><br />
[05:06:00] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh, all sorts of things. She is based around the goddess of knowledge and crafts, after all.</span><br />
[05:06:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But yeah...</span><br />
[05:06:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  equips her LR-Pack and hovers in the air a bit. --</span><br />
[05:06:53] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: We should go soon.</span><br />
[05:07:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  activates his jet wings --</span><br />
[05:07:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, low speed, don't wanna disturb the consorts...</span><br />
[05:07:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  moon jumps off the house. --</span><br />
[05:07:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  flies up and towards the village, motioning for FL to follow. --</span><br />
[05:08:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just jumping hopping torwards the village, not wanting to increase the jet wings any louder. --</span><br />
[05:09:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  deactivates the jet wings after entering the village. --</span><br />
[05:09:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  soon lands in the consort village. The consorts are not bothered in the slightest. The consort village is of standard fare, except for the large, extravagent building titled "SCHOOL-HOUSE NUMBER 112" --</span><br />
[05:10:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the building. --</span><br />
[05:10:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... here we are.</span><br />
[05:10:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so, is this seperate rooms?</span><br />
[05:10:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or should I just look in the window?</span><br />
[05:11:28] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh, its a large building, but its only really one big room. Just... look in a window, or enter.</span><br />
[05:11:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks in the window --</span><br />
[05:14:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT athensHeroine [CAH]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:14:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#000000">[CAH]</span>  You see one very large classroom, with only one person setting up. She is a very tall, golden-brown haired woman, seemingly iin her mid-twentys. The only thing that sets her apart is that her eyes are a shocking electric blue, and that she seems to have brown feathers around her wrists. She does not pay any attention to the windows, at the moment. --</span><br />
[05:14:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[05:14:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads to the door --</span><br />
[05:14:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... welp.</span><br />
[05:15:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, shall we go in?</span><br />
[05:15:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need to say sorry</span><br />
[05:16:02] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: After you...</span><br />
[05:16:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  nerviously reaches for the handle... --</span><br />
[05:16:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#000000">[CAH]</span>  absentmindedly opens the door for FL with a flick of her wrist. "Ah, class has not started yet, dearie, but is there anything I can help you with..?" She says, not turning he gase from her desk. --</span><br />
[05:16:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I wanted to say sorry.</span><br />
[05:16:45] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Ah..?</span><br />
[05:16:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#11ddbb">[CAH]</span>  looks up from her desk. --</span><br />
[05:17:22] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Oh... a player... what is it you wanted to say "sorry" about then?</span><br />
[05:17:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Sorry for attempting to threaten you with the dice... I know we haven't met in person, but Sog kinda relayed the message.</span><br />
[05:17:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm Charles, or FLmun on the memo...</span><br />
[05:17:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not sure what Sog called me as...</span><br />
[05:18:17] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Ah... those things... -And you are the "FL" person, hm?</span><br />
[05:18:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yes.</span><br />
[05:19:04] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Well, no need to worry. It was clearly an empty threat, and I cannot send my warriors to your land...</span><br />
[05:19:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is glad hes wearing shades right now... --</span><br />
[05:19:13] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Thankfully for you.</span><br />
[05:19:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[05:19:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah... thankfully for me.</span><br />
[05:19:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is backing away --</span><br />
[05:19:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll... just go.</span><br />
[05:19:58] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Indeed. Now, if you were to ever go through with any sort of threat to me or my land...</span><br />
[05:20:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
[05:20:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would be more dead then a squirrel in the middle of the road.</span><br />
[05:20:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#11ddbb">[CAH]</span>  chucks a knife by FL, it barely missing and sticking in the door. --</span><br />
[05:20:47] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: Indeed. Now go.</span><br />
[05:20:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  drops to the floor, hands behind his head. --</span><br />
[05:21:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, going now.</span><br />
[05:21:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  crawls out in a hurry --</span><br />
[05:21:19] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: I have a class to run. It's not welcome to players like yourself. Goodbye.</span><br />
[05:21:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  gets outside. --</span><br />
[05:21:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#11ddbb">[CAH]</span>  slams the door with another flick of her wrist. --</span><br />
[05:21:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So... yeah.</span><br />
[05:22:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I pissed off the god of knowledge.</span><br />

[05:22:13] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: - and warfare.</span><br />
[05:22:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Don't forget warfare.</span><br />
[05:22:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
[05:22:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: kinda did forget that</span><br />
[05:22:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Yeah you really fucked up.</span><br />
[05:22:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...At least I came in person to say sorry.</span><br />
[05:22:58] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh</span><br />
[05:23:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: instead of putting it off forever.</span><br />
[05:23:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...That door might have been me if that was the case.</span><br />
[05:23:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: She's mostly talk. As long as you don't harm her or the land, you should be fine.</span><br />
[05:23:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah... she has good aim... But anyways.</span><br />
[05:23:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...kinda wanted to know what she was teaching today... I guess I won't now.</span><br />
[05:24:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
[05:24:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyway, I guess I should get going</span><br />

[05:24:42] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Er... It might be kinda late for that, huh.</span><br />
[05:25:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah...</span><br />
[05:25:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah well. I'm heading back to HQ then. See yah.</span><br />
[05:25:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
[05:26:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks around the consort village, looking for an odd shop. --</span><br />
[05:26:13] <span style="color:#11ddbb">CAH: ((... in which I learn that "Ah" pings this))</span><br />
[05:26:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs and blasts off, to the HQ. --</span><br />

[05:26:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is looking for a consort shop before going. --</span><br />
[05:28:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT athensHeroine <span style="color:#11ddbb">[CAH]</span>  the village is standare fare. The chameleons stare at you as you pass. The lone "shop" has a purple chameleon running it, and it is lost in its newspaper. --</span><br />
[05:28:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks over to the shop. --</span><br />

[05:29:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT chameleonConsort <span style="color:#000000">[CCC]</span>  looks up from its news paper, clearly annoyed. --</span><br />

[05:29:45] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks around the shop to see whats for sale. --</span><br />
[05:29:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Maybe Athena wrote a book he could buy... --</span><br />
[05:31:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: uh, just browsing right now.</span><br />
[05:32:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT chameleonConsort <span style="color:#9816e3">[CCC]</span>  the shop has all sorts of goodies, waiting to fly off the shelf. They sell things from gummies to robotic-parts. On closer inspection, there is a whole section on books the local denizen has written! However... THESE PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUS. --</span><br />
[05:32:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks his book dollar count, maybe he can still buy some... --</span><br />
[05:32:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( boondollar* ))</span><br />
[05:33:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // I mean, its not like they cost the same as Fraymotifs... right? --</span><br />
[05:34:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT chameleonConsort <span style="color:#9816e3">[CCC]</span>  if you have been saving up, you most likely can still buy things. That being said, half a boon-buck is still /way/ too much for a book. --</span><br />
[05:34:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks again... yeah, he has the moneys through Honey Jar sales to his consorts. --</span><br />
[05:35:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks how many books she has written... he is gonna try to buy all of them. --</span><br />
[05:36:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( remember, his Consorts are geckos, so the honey jars are gonna be selling like crazy even at the decent price he set them at... ))</span><br />
[05:36:34] <span style="color:#9816e3">CCC: ((noted))</span><br />
[05:37:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( FL has a few boon bonds to his name... not that many, but still. ))</span><br />
[05:38:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT chameleonConsort <span style="color:#9816e3">[CCC]</span>  Well... besides an autobiography, the current books written by athena that are for sale are: "Warfare and you," "Sharp blades are your friends: a novel," and "How to advance your skills the easy way!" All the other books are just normal Science and history textbooks books of the local lands. --</span><br />
[05:39:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'd like one of each of Athena's books.</span><br />
