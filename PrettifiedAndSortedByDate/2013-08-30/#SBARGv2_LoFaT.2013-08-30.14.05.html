[02:07:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  takes a while to get to the basement, he just /had/ to check the upper floors first. --</span><br />
[02:08:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  finally spots ash... oh /god/. --</span><br />
[02:08:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *waves over at FL, sprawled out in midair by the corpse* Yo.</span><br />
[02:08:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You want her?</span><br />

[02:09:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is... is the bullet still in there?</span><br />
[02:09:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly walks forwards. --</span><br />

[02:10:09] Ash is laying there in a motionless heap, blood pooling under her head, her cape flung untidily over her body. Gunshot to the temple was the cause of death. The catgirl sprawled out next to her with a deck of cards just staaares at FL.<br />
[02:10:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, I performed surgery to remove it.</span><br />
[02:10:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[02:10:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't even need a detector.</span><br />
[02:11:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't even know what a bullet /looks like/, FL.</span><br />
[02:11:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's /probably/ still in there.</span><br />
[02:11:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  examines Ash, rolling her over. --</span><br />
[02:12:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  the shot went right through --</span><br />
[02:12:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  there is no bullet, looks like she used a Sniper round at point blank --</span><br />
[02:13:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, that means that the bullet isn't inside her... so that shouldn't be blocking revival...</span><br />
[02:13:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, then, I've been here for long enough that she /should/ have revived.</span><br />
[02:13:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: do you know when it happened?</span><br />
[02:14:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: More than, I'd say, fifteen minutes ago.</span><br />
[02:14:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  several hours, actually --</span><br />
[02:14:38] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has only been here for fifteen minutes, geez!*</span><br />
[02:14:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  :P --</span><br />
[02:14:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why hasn't she revived?</span><br />
[02:14:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok. well, it ranges from a few minutes to a few hours usually...</span><br />
[02:15:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, maybe it was Heroic, Just, or a load of glitched melodramatic bullshit.</span><br />
[02:15:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  attempts to feel the temperature of Ash's skin... --</span><br />
[02:15:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  cold as ice. In fact, it static glitches a little bit, Originating from he rknuckles --</span><br />
[02:15:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[02:15:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god</span><br />
[02:15:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Stop being lazy and revive now, geez.</span><br />
[02:16:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or I'm keeping you as a pet.</span><br />
[02:16:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, it doesn't make sense. if she pulled the trigger, suicide cannot count as Heroic or Just, and the definitions of those terms are so hardcoded I doubt Chronos could have broken them...</span><br />
[02:16:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well, we have a completely illogical death.</span><br />
[02:16:31] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or a /really/ convincing corpse.</span><br />
[02:16:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or Chronos hacked her memo and she fought back...</span><br />
[02:16:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  theres more static, glitching more frequently, Combined with Rainbow sparks of energy now, arching off her knuckles --</span><br />
[02:17:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[02:17:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait... whats going on?</span><br />
[02:17:16] <span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Maybe she's reviving now...?</span><br />
[02:17:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *looks down* If she goes trickster mode, it's a Just Death to put her down, right?</span><br />
[02:17:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, stand back guys...</span><br />
[02:17:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks the the knuckles. --</span><br />
[02:17:30] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *shields herself with a card*</span><br />
[02:17:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is not standing back... --</span><br />
[02:19:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe6a27">[CPO]</span>  stands next to FL, pressing a button on his armor --</span><br />
[02:19:46] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just... looking at the sparks... --</span><br />
[02:20:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  For reference I guess <a href='http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111203201723/mspaintadventures/images/2/2a/03850.gif'>http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111203201723/mspaintadventures/images/2/2a/03850.gif</a> --</span><br />
[02:20:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup, that's definitely a revival happening.</span><br />
[02:21:27] <span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Woooaaahhh...</span><br />
[02:21:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  the Body rises up to a floating position before the energy pulses off her body, Wound gone as she just kinda floats there, Hood up and hiding her eyes --</span><br />
[02:21:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's cool.</span><br />
[02:22:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ash...</span><br />
[02:22:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  cannot hold the tears in. --</span><br />
[02:22:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fe6a27">[CPO]</span>  puts a hand on FL's shoulder. --</span><br />
[02:23:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  looks up, eyes glazed over a bit, but she's moving --</span><br />
[02:23:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hooray, she's alive again. What'd she want, an audience?</span><br />
[02:24:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  looks over at AG with a questionable look, Mute otherwise --</span><br />
[02:24:16] <span style="color:#fe6a27">CPO: Is it a crime to be concerned, Gambit?</span><br />
[02:24:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks forward slightly. --</span><br />
[02:24:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gives Gambit a "really?" stare --</span><br />
[02:24:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I /showed up/, didn't I? *scowls over at them both*</span><br />
[02:25:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  smiles brightly and shakes her head, Gestureing her hands... Sign language. "It's okay, Don't worry" --</span><br />
