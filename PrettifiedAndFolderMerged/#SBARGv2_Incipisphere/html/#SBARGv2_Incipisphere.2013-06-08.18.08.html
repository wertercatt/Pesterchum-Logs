<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ What? /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It will strip us of our aspect powers, but it should strip chronos's as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: how about /no/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bad idea in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Sounds highly dangerous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: have you never played anything ever</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ Despite the supposed 'good' side /)</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: FS has a point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">PSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: there's almost a 99% chance all that would do is deprive us of our only weapons and leave him untouched</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not if the weapons aren't aspect based.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like both of mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I meant aspects as weapons</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and a 413% chance that even if it worked, he'd still be able to beat our faces in</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That is a /bad/ idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You are drop dead horrible at it and I would much rather sacrifice you to the dark gods to give us the power to kill him than listen to a word you saaaay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You know that guy that makes that plan that gets everybody killed because everybody was such a hardtard to listen?</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Despite how messed up we already are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yes, besides make him look like a glitchy dumbass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nobody is scared of static eyes.</span><br />
