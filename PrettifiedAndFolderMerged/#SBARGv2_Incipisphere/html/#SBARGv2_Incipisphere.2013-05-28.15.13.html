<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So I think the secret passage might have to do with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: wαs it a fucking trickster?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't know, possibly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: It could be...Ushiromiya Maria.......</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Your straying from the point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ((afk for reals))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...I know SOMEONE threw in a T!mutie plush/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that was MG...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: trickster mutie? oh frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The point is that whatever's doing it might be in that passage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And it may be able to affect ALL the imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Not just that one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...touhou?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what were we even thinking when we were prototyping?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: FUCKING STOP GUESSING!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I AM ALMOST SURE IT WASN'T ANYTHING PROTOTYPED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I needed to prototype /something/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I prototyped cruxite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Are you going to come and help investigate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The imp was trapped outside of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not yelling at you, yours porbably was opne of the least harmful right next to chocolate</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And the Battlepen barely defeated it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: i αm staying the fuck away from that trickster shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You sure it was an Imp?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So imagine something farther inside of the passage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, check the body.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't know what it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might have gotten a weapon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I can only guess that it was an imp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The body is under a pile of rubble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...might be ya Dezien.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: effecting ya imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: THEN COME HELP ME!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: If its the denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: then there is a denizen under my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I need help to stop it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Did ya fight ya dezien ye, or no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It is still under the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: But it might attack at any time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't even know that it IS</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: a denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It could be something WORSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I bet the underling was a lich.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: you αre so fucked if it is your denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: jst wondering, what kinda professions did your parents used to have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I still don't know that it was a common underling, if it even was an underling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I've lived with my sister.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually, I'm pretty sure the denizen lair only spawns in an area far away from the dwelling spire (like, in the southern hemisphere if the spire is considered the land's north pole)...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: then... what was it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so what you saw was probably some kinda underling, but with shithive-maggots stats</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: oh god oh god oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It must be a new archtype</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I've met a lich queen...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You may need to upgrade your stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: What could I prototype at this point?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The battle pen is made of an artifact I stole from denizen accultists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Scribblenauts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It cost a shit ton of grist. I stole most of it from SA.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...who was SA agai-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: player death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: the one I prototyped.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Where is he anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: He went back in time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, that may have been hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Uh, like I said, we pulled a different approach, as that would have caused a doomed timeline... he got eaten by a glitch instead. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((well too late now, I guess the person I believe to be the owner knows, I think.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...uh... should I should I not send my sprite to the FG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If he needs power, I can give him the Mr Fusion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: HE IS NOT GOING TO GET MY SPRITE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He, she, it, whatever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((lets just say that he is from a doomed timeline))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((and I'm pretty sure FG is a girl, at least in the fanart on that one site thingy))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Could just have the hair. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#c1bb10">CURRENT courageousScribe [CCS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I just thought of this but what would happen if two people with only one teir prototyping fused their sprites together by prototyping one into the other?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( BISHI. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Anyway, I sealed it off temporarily.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CS, you are an idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ..Yeah. I'm worried he's goingto turn the sprites into a powersource.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: am I?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: But at some point i'll need your help...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ... I say try it, CSS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: or am i just curious about the outcomes of anything\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would obviously begin to prototype everything it touches, and pull stuff in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: BLACK HOLE KERNEL SPRITE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah^</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: remember in homestuck when Caliborn entered?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually FL, that was jossed. Caliborn didn't have a KernelspriteDivideByZeroException, it was ONE sprite that became a black hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EVERY IMP CAN PROTOTYPE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either way, it ends the world.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: generally a bad idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((I was thinking the underling under the house was one of the misc. ones that John defeated in cascade))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Considering FL almost got killed by a lich queen, I doubt it. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((doesn't matter at the moment, I guess.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tired...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gonna nap now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: so... ya still need help, yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I'm going to procrastinate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Make some better weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Good idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...when did you enter?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I'm still hoping for a response soon re: sprite safety with this battery thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: That must be why SA got pissed</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I asked him to go help with the sprite thing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I'm going to fight my way down the passage when I have stronger weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And a flash light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: We're just lucky no one prototyped with a shitty creepypasta.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: That would fucking suck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: no one protoed a creepypasta, but I think FG used a bit of "SCP: Containment Breach" code to patch something, since more than once I've seen memetic hazards in the skaian clouds...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: ...NicE...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...actaully, we should be thankful there aren't more prototyping around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: well, it is a... what, how many players have we seen in total? 20-30ish? so we're at least twice as many as the trolls' session</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...Actually, it's connected to me asking when ND entered, and why he hasn't come in here before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: maybe the glitch affects their time of appearance into the medium even though they left earth at the same time we did... kind of like that one bit in half-life 2 where they were sent a week into the future and they didn't notice</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so like a few players are in "earth-medium limbo" randomly and they don't enter the game proper until now, but to them it seemed like a normal entry</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: That What I was thinking CP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((and it kinda works better from a meta perspective than "they were out of contact / didn't know about the memo / etc"))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I think I get that</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ((tgat was my headcannon, as well))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: expepct... how many do you think are... trapped?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: okay, here's the million-boondollar question: /how many prototyping towers are there on Prospit and Derse?/</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...from the sight I saw, the answer is many.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...also looking like they were glitching, as if it wasn't sure howmany there should be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: this session os so fucked up</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: When I was on prospit, there were quite a few.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Atleast 100</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: If we scratch our session and a player enters after that because of the glitch, where will they end up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...holy frogsprite, 100 kerneltowers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ND: probably irrelevant, a Scratch retcons the home universe as well as the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: there were more than a hundred</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: the place is like a giant concrete jungle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: except with whatever material prospitian buildings are made of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: its likely that there are even more of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: but they ended up somewhere else... I guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#005500">[CCP]</span>  just had a NerdCubed-tier idea... Mirror's Edge: Prospit Edition --</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The amount of towers itself might cause its own glitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: But the result of that glitch remains to be seen</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I have not had any visions of such a rift</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: I think we are already in a scratched session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: or of such an anything that the glitch may have caused</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: At the moment, I can only theorize that there is likely a kernel glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FF, I think several of us already believe that. the "corrupted player" mentioned earlier has already been informally named Pre-Scratch Douche Bag</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Unless our gaurdian resolved that, which since I know a lot about coding, is nearly impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: maybe things are getting worse because the Pumpkin Battery is drained?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Not even reality warping could easily stop such an error</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: If I could find a way to hack the session, it would take me months to try and fix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: If not years.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And at the rate everything is getting fucked up, we don't HAVE years OR months.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Even with time travel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: we could if we had a way to create a secondary type of gaurdian, but thats only a theory.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And there is no way to even TEST that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Much less execute something so amazing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So unless we can create a new type of power source, reminescent of a Green Sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: We cannot possibly be able to stop this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: did someone say......</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: Green Sun?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: THATS what he's tying to DO. Make the green sun... maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: IDE: our session is fucked up because it's so close to the <span style="color:#00ed4f">Green Sun</span> the radiation is causing Bec-Tier interference</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I was rambling about how we could possibly be able to get a powerful enough computer to fix the glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: We would literally need what I would like to call, a Pink Sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((How do you do that fancy text?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And that is most likely impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Can we...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Maybe we could alchemize one though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: but that would require EVERY grist EVER concieved. In high quantity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And then, even if we could do that. We would need a way to harness it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: We would need to create a 2nd Gaurdian or some bullshit like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((ND: regex quirk to colorcode-wrap any instance of "[gG]reen [sS]un" ([] meaning case-insensitive of that letter)))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: that would be...silly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((that is confusing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Its impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: no. if we were going to make a <span style="color:#ff00ff">Pink Sun</span> (fuck that's magenta), it'd require the mass of two dead universes, just like the regular <span style="color:#00ed4f">Green Sun</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Thats what I just said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, what's going on now? I was  kinda zoned out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I meant, impossible in a DIFFERENT manner than you said</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: the morons wαnt to make a pink sun</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: NDwants to make the pink sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Then in order to make the 2nd Gaurdian we would need to piece together code from a 1st gaurdian. As well as try to get rid of any psychotic urges that could arise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I can't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: you said we need ALL THE GRIST IN EVERY SBURB SESSION IN PARADOX SPACE, I said that <span style="color:#00ed4f">Sun</span> creation (regardless of color) requires the mass of two universes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Its impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: OMG, did you pay attention? (not you ND) I said like 15 times that it is impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't want to make one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: BECAUSE we can't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: CP was paying attention.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((fuck I said not you ND, I meant CP))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: She even came up with her own reason for it being impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Both reasons are correct in different ways.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c31212">CND: (Okay, doesn't matter. The point is that you listened)</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So that entire rambling was basically for nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Any of you have ideas for how we could find a computer with enough power to run a code of that scale?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It would literally be an acre in mass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...What code?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: A code for getting rid of something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The point of the Pink Sun idea was to get a computer with enough processing power to run a code on such a large scale.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Explain this idea more?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: We would create the Pink Sun (if that were even possible) to create '2nd Gaurdian' who's power we could harness to make a computer with enough proccessing power to run a code that literally has an Acre's mass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That is literally the most stupid thing I have ever heard.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c31212">CND: EXACTLY!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: God, I have been saying how stupid it was through that whole rambling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay first of all, we would need some kind of tumor to even create an explosion of that intensity, the Green sun was created by the explosion of /2 universes/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: EXACTLY!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I thought the <span style="color:#ff00ff">Pink Sun</span> idea was for powering FIRST Guardian's fixing machine so she doesn't have to use our sprites...</span><br />

<span style="color:#c31212">CND: That... would have made more since.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Why didn't I think of that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: in which case, we'd only need a <span style="color:#ff00ff">Pink Dwarf Star</span> the size of Planet Fucking Jupiter. still dumb, but magnitudes less impossible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: yah</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: we don't even have a way to harness the power</span><br />

<span style="color:#c31212">CND: yes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">FCP: SJ, no. last I checked, we were contemplating *making* a <span style="color:#ff00ff">Pink Dwarf Star</span> so the sprites don't have to sudoku-sacrifice</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What exactly is a Zillium?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">FCP: NV: more vague shit about the self-prototyping. and of course he didn't mention the outcome of the <span style="color:#ff00ff">P.D.S.</span> plan</span><br />
