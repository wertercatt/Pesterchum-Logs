<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Okay, got it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its not black, this one is green and has an atom symbol on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But it seems to be okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Even has an internal powersource.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I think that it's a Power Cell then</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Have my laptop plugged into it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: There has got to be an easier way other than just guessing from the codes on the back of my cards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Depends of if you trust Gamefaqs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Everyone on the forums for the game are complete idiots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Well then get back to guessing. =P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'll check it again...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...wait, double punching?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Ill try that, hold on one sec.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Oh my lord.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Oh yeah, I managed to mix my hub and power cell that way</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Also, what's "oh my lord"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THIS EARLIER!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Okay, laptop AND hub OR shades.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: This is something someone on those forums by punching cards like that: <a href='http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0ljpcmvSU1qzmxxso1_500.jpg'>http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0ljpcmvSU1qzmxxso1_500.jpg</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Also I mixed my phone, laptop, shades, hub and power cell just now</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I was attempting to find similaritys in the numbers of the codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: This is much easier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I need to experiment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'll be wasting a ton of grist now!</span><br />
