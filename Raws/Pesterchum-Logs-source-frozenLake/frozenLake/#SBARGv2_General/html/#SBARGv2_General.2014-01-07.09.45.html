[05:26:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its a summoning chip.</span><br />

[05:27:10] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: still though, you wouldn't want people using your character like that even if it weren't the actual one</span><br />
[05:27:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
[05:30:23] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: especially since the navi that the chip belongs to can create a second copy of themselves in the games</span><br />
[05:30:31] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: *that the chip is</span><br />
[05:31:23] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: probably what'll happen is that they'll leave the chip after a fight if the OOC wants to</span><br />
[05:31:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Style Change would obviously be limited to Navi's with Chng,BAT installed.</span><br />
[05:31:57] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I was thinking we might invent some new features, tbh</span><br />
[05:32:17] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: something like style change and soul cross definitly</span><br />
[05:33:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Style Change would be avaliable to everyone, but other than Cross Fusion, soul cross wouldn't really... work, for anyone other than megaman.</span><br />
[05:33:30] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we're going to make up something like it probably</span><br />
[05:33:43] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and then make it a downloadable program or something</span><br />
[05:33:54] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: might even have some plot potential if we do it right</span><br />
[05:34:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, expanding Style Change with Navi Styles would work out, but it would require a navi chip to activate.</span><br />

[05:34:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For Balance reasons.</span><br />

[05:43:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (well except for gospel)</span><br />
[05:43:56] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: maybe sometime after megaman bn6 but before star force, then?</span><br />
[05:44:09] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I dunno, I just don't want them to have an extreme influence is all</span><br />
[05:44:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it took place after BN6, we would have too many copy bots running around.</span><br />
[05:44:21] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: so we can do some more original stuff</span><br />
[05:44:49] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not make an OOC rule about not having copy bots?</span><br />
[05:45:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, obviously the main goals could be similar... but the way all of them go about doing it could be /massively different/</span><br />
[05:45:42] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Its a matter of not wanting it to be at the beggining of the series or before it </span><br />
[05:45:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ah.</span><br />
[05:45:59] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: because the technology is kind of more fun in the later games</span><br />
[05:46:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, most of the tech exists before hand.</span><br />
[05:46:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, what Tech are you talking about?</span><br />
[05:46:26] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but it gets more advanced over the course of the games</span><br />
[05:46:43] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: doesn't the PET go through a shit ton of upgrades from the first game?</span><br />
[05:46:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We could start out with the more advanced PETs... and upgrade it further.</span><br />
[05:46:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wifi PETs.</span><br />
[05:47:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, it does.</span><br />
[05:47:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, those can be done earlier in this branched timeline.</span><br />
[05:49:24] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and then also, I feel like maybe having some more original antagonist organizations might be a bit more fun</span><br />
[05:51:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The problem with basing it after EXE6 is Wily reforming.</span><br />
[05:51:26] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Why is that a problem?</span><br />
[05:51:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Wily was behind of /all/ of the organizations.</span><br />
[05:52:18] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not have organizations that aren't based around him</span><br />
[05:53:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because well... big bads, man. You can't live without them.</span><br />
[05:53:45] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not have a different big bad</span><br />
[05:53:56] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we could probably do it after the main cast is dead</span><br />

[05:54:23] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but I think its a few hundred years before starfor-</span><br />
[05:54:26] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: wait what?</span><br />
[05:55:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000aa">CURRENT Noodles [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:55:00] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Leaf, Link or Legal System?</span><br />
[05:55:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Survived islands sinking, massive pointblank explosions, being absorbed into alpha...</span><br />
[05:55:40] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: isn't it explained how he survived those</span><br />
[05:55:43] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and also, didn</span><br />
[05:55:46] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: fuck</span><br />
[05:56:03] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: didn't Wily reform in the first megamans then turn out to be fucking with everyone</span><br />
[05:56:13] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I mean, i'm not sure we want to use him</span><br />
[05:56:23] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but I think that if the original game's Wily would do that</span><br />
[05:56:34] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: the BN games' wily might do that too</span><br />
[05:57:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats an irk that I have with the original megaman games that isn't realistic.</span><br />
[05:58:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /they fucking believed him/</span><br />
[05:58:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like how they /let regal back in at the end of 5/</span><br />
[05:58:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dude, he had hidden himself then took over in 4.</span><br />
[05:59:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If noone thinks it is and act and doing it again, I have no faith in logic.</span><br />
[05:59:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is an act*</span><br />
[06:00:09] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: well i'm sure he dies eventually</span><br />
[06:00:19] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: or else he'd still be there for starforce</span><br />
[06:00:34] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: or you'd atleast here about him </span><br />
[06:00:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who says he isn't?</span><br />
[06:00:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He might be playing a role like Model W.</span><br />
[06:01:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we never got past 3 games.</span><br />
[06:01:03] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: &gt;:?</span><br />
[06:01:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you ever played Zero and ZX?</span><br />
[06:01:25] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: yeah</span><br />
[06:01:37] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Model W is important throughout both games</span><br />
[06:01:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Model W is the last traces of Dr. Weil.</span><br />
[06:02:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Combined with Ragnarok.</span><br />
[06:02:19] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: how would that work for Wily then?</span><br />
[06:02:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The answer lies in the third game, and basic computer logic.</span><br />
[06:03:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the third game, Wily was able to upload into a computer.</span><br />
[06:03:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And tell me, what do you usually do to game files before making changes?</span><br />
[06:03:52] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: what do you mean?</span><br />
[06:03:58] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: save?</span><br />
[06:04:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, for when you are modding it.</span><br />
[06:04:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does one normally do?</span><br />
[06:04:22] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I don't know? I don't mod shit</span><br />
[06:04:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /they make backups/</span><br />
[06:05:30] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: ah</span><br />
[06:06:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So basically I just managed to combine the Sigma Virus and Model W for... potentially something that takes place after the 3 starforce games.</span><br />
[06:07:08] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: &gt;:?</span><br />
[06:07:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#72a0c1">CURRENT imagineBreaker [CIB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:07:47] <span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Model W = Weil</span><br />
[06:07:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, why don't you just do a Post Starforce RP?</span><br />
[06:07:53] <span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Wiley made a back up of himself before becoming a good guy, that gets released?</span><br />
[06:07:57] <span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: is that the idea?</span><br />
[06:08:13] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: because I don't know what that would even be about</span><br />
[06:08:23] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: if its after starforce whats even happening?</span><br />
[06:08:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SS, thats how Wily managed to survive dying all those times, along with a robot body likely.</span><br />
[06:08:31] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: are they still doing wave tech or whatever</span><br />
[06:08:33] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: or what?</span><br />
[06:08:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doesn't need to be too far after.</span><br />
[06:09:10] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: i'd need to talk to AE about it</span><br />
[06:09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which one</span><br />
[06:09:25] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: since they were kind of the reason I even decided to do it</span><br />
[06:09:28] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Espurr</span><br />
[06:09:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />

[06:10:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You are going to need it.</span><br />
[06:10:10] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: i'm all for a starforce thing tbh</span><br />
[06:10:19] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but I dunno :/</span><br />
[06:10:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, make sure to keep backups of the tumblr sourcecode.</span><br />
[06:10:39] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: why?</span><br />
[06:10:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, you don't want a repeat, right?</span><br />
[06:11:04] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: oh yeah</span><br />
[06:11:06] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: that</span><br />
