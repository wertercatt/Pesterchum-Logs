<span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: SE, can you restate your point once more, in as simple terms/sentences as you can make it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Since we don't seem to understand?</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">We</span>'re arguing about semantic crap because no one's telling us what we suggest to do about things like that happening so frequently.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: quickly, fuk u don't tell me what to do</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: secondly</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CSE: The /issue/ was in that PK /gifted the players ability to do something/</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CSE: /without having a way to do it/</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: woah look</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i've done it before</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: and I reconed it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I /know/</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Right</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ sup PK</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ long time no see</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">So</span> the topic of discussion: that being a common occurrance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">The</span> suggested solution to the topic of discussion?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: It was mostly because im really tired with doing this On the Fly dungeons</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: not allow me to DM anymore?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13"><span style="color:#008282">CURRENT circuitousAntipathy [CCA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ First off NN, what do you mean by " things like that"? The dragon shout thing? Because honestly I see that the root of the problem lies with the fact that everyone seems to want to graft different series onto Homestuck and often they /just don't work./ Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so the issue is with having reanable causes and reasons for things being able to happen. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Okay</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Muting</span> memo real quick.</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span>'ll give voice to the people who matter to the topic</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: &gt;:T</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ That is a rather totalitarian position Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Might I offer an alternative? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Depends</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">What</span> is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: please</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">The</span> main issue is</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ lets hear it</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">People</span> keep shouting about things we've /already discussed/</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: /while we're still recapping it/</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: /for them/</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ okay ALL SHUSH FOR NOW let CA do the thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Making</span> it hard to follow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Your</span> solution to that, CA?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ How about we each stop for me a moment and have each side present their issue. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ SE obviously has a deeper issue than the shouts Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">That</span>'s what we're /doing/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Then lets have SE talk and then you all talk Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ well</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ in turns Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ right now we're all just</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ yelling</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">SE</span>, as he was saying, has an issue with these things:</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ all at the same time</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13">Memo is now <span style="color:#000000">Muted</span> by <span style="color:#000000">CCC</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">1</span>: people grafting things onto the ARG because they think they're cool, without considering how they fit in the series;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">2</span>: godmodding by adding these in without giving them a method to work</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">3</span>: never asking if it's a good idea before attempting it</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> gave <span style="color:#000000">SE</span> voice.<br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Correct</span>?</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (Note to self: give bot voice powers in addition to ban powers.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> gave <span style="color:#aa4a4b">PK</span> voice.<br />
<span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> gave <span style="color:#000000">CA</span> voice.<br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Can I go ahead and retcon the shity shit that happened in dungeon500, specifically AG's gift of the dark side and the Death Star as that was really fucking dumb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: That's about the short-hand version without you and DP's consistent interruptions. An additional point to make is a lack of /people to go to/. Also, PK. I /do not specifically blame you or anyone at all/. Do not feel guilty in any manner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Okay</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">So</span>, what's your solution to it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: like fuck im auctually angry at past!me's stupidity</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: PK, please stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Also. NN, I'm pointing out an issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">So</span> no solution, yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: /mute powerkitten</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So one thing that people tend to miss that that mechanically powers in Homestuck come from one of two things: your title and items. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: fail</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I would suggest not randomly giving out powers. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: NN would you mind remuting me for a bit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ How about instead you give out items that have powers. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">If</span> I can figure out how.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Yes</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: If you expect a single person to have a solution at the single moment you ask them without giving them time to consider one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Like a laser rifle instead of the ability to shoot lasers Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCC</span> took away <span style="color:#aa4a4b">PK</span>'s voice.<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /That said/, I do have a solution.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">There</span> you go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Oh, didn't finish my sentence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Lemme graft the end on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ go ahead SE Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: If you expect a single person to have a solution at the single moment you ask them without giving them time to consider one then you have shit expectations and need to realize that that is a poor way of solving the issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: There we go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: NOW.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (Just before you start, I had figured you were pointing it out due to having a solution.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (Anyway continue.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm aware.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: That being said. The issues I have? The solution is literally /do what your not doing/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Look at them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CNN: 3: never asking if it's a good idea before attempting it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: woah look. Fucking ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Well then, like I've said, its easy to add in new things into the Homestuck universe when you put it through some simply questions. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CNN: 2: godmodding by adding these in without giving them a method to work</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: consider why it may work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ask, and converse with other players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CNN: 1: people grafting things onto the ARG because they think they're cool, without considering how they fit in the series;</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: woah holy shit spiffy. you could even go as far /as to ask the GM if it may work or not/</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Well</span>, the issue is: that's not enforcable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ask yourself "where does the power come from", "what does the power do?", and "does this break the laws of the universe." Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">And</span> the people who are most likely to do that won't remember those guidelines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">Especially</span> since they'd be unwritten if they weren't on the ARG itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Really? Cause I'm pretty sure PK feels kinda shitty about this all, and is likely to remember it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm pretty sure people keeping up with this, are likely to remember it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And you know what they'll do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Tell others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> was thinking non-repeat offenders, forgot about that variable. Yeah it makes more sense with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ "Powers" in the sense of special moves and abilities almost always come from items and titles in this setting so if, say you wanted to give AG Sith powers to do Fore Push then give her an item that lets her telekinetically move things. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Warn them, "Hey, this is a bit out of bounds. Mind explaining it?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ REally we just need to all keep it in mind as a rule of thumb here Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Ugh thinking up logic for why things work can take me several hours minimum</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13">You need voice (+v) (#SBARGv2_General)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Also. That's some high up shit right there. You'd have to be alchemizing some /goddamn god-level shit/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Everyone GMing anything should ask themselves what their loot does and if it breaks the establish system. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Right. Item powers really aren't what makes the high level abilities Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: I think just not giving ANY loot for my dungeons, other then grist, would fix what I accidently cause</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13">You need voice (+v) (#SBARGv2_General)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ An example of this being Ahab's Crosshairs vs Eridan's Wand Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The Crosshairs are a god item and yet the wand is more powerful. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Ahab's Crosshairs is the, recordedly, strongest Rifle of it's kind, to keep in mind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13"><span style="color:#000000">CDP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Right. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I'd suggest we all tone it down just a little bit on the power creep/ Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> gave <span style="color:#aa4a4b">PK</span> voice.<br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Or else it will be kind of unsustainable after a while Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I've seen it happen in other games and I'd hate to see it go too far here. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: I think I could fix it on my end by not giving any loot other then grist</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13"><span style="color:#000000">CPP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I think loot is a fine idea so long as its nothing crazy. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCC</span> made <span style="color:#000000">PP</span> an OP.<br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ~version</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT plasmaPython [CPP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#44036f">CPP: 1.2.0: Internal restructuring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Just go pick up some dnd books and look up the loot there Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Most of that would be OP for the ARG</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> gave <span style="color:#000000">AG</span> voice.<br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Only the really high level stuff Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: I've read though the 2nd edition</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ um Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ 2nd edition is broke as hell Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">aaaa</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: back no topic</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">y</span> u no 3.5e best e nub</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ go read the 3.5 dungeon master's book and pick the lover level stuff Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: *on</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Also, PK isn't the only one giving batshit insane/high level loot, and powers/items can be acquired by just adding things into your dungeon as basically scenery, as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Ive rescaled LoCaL entirely to be less random</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Could be worth mentioning. That one time I ran a dungeon? Didn't give any loot. Only near death experiences for most all involved.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ The point is that there are resources you can use if you don't want to think up what to give out. Just take a look at the lower level stuff and if any of the things jump out at you then use them Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Of course this means Im going to have to plan all of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Loot isn't the be all end all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ yep Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: [KIDS SHOW VOICE] it's about the experiences we have together!</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: [KIDS SHOW SECONDARY CHAR VOICE] that's dumb where's my loot</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If someone interacts with the scenery in a dungeon in ways you didn't expect them to, as well,-- say, /stealing it/-- it can be a problem. Especially if you /let/ them steal it. And it's either odd, overpowered, or both.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: thats why I need to have a No AG you cant do that clause in every dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm speaking as someone who goes to like. All the dungeons. And has acquired a fuckton of crazy powers/items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4c2f13">Memo is no longer <span style="color:#000000">Muted</span> by <span style="color:#000000">CCC</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Half of which /I/ deem too dumb to use except on LOCAL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> think since we've calmed down enough we can turn off the mute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, pk, dunno, I thought it was cool when you gave ordinary items out like those happy-meal toys. as long as it's ordinary stuff without inherant effect on combat it should be fair game probably. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And I know that almost everone is gonna forget about all this literally right fukin' after.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: most of the time AG, you steal something then bitch about me about how it doesnt fit your logic</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: um</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: *to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Its fine AG, when you steal from the dungeon I plan on running next week I won't stop you. I will just make you wish you hadn't done that. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">hmm</span></span><br />
