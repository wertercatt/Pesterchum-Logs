[05:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how did I... get here?</span><br />

[05:35] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  glances outside, shades switching to a grey and red color on the screen. --</span><br />
[05:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I guess after the repeated brushportallings into Lyoko, three instances of Nippon, two despair-wracked worlds, and a Prospitian warship - to name a few - I guess pspace decided to send me back here then.</span><br />
[05:36] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...what.</span><br />
[05:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //note: by this point it is assumed that Kimura has obtained the "Boundless Mist Warp" handysash badge, like he has had all along tumblr-rp-ways --</span><br />

[05:37] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  looks at kimura... an almost reflection on the shades shows that Kimura is all red, while the area around him is grey. --</span><br />
[05:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, why's the bar all spoopy mode?</span><br />
[05:39] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: A spider moved in. Brad killed it, and I shoved the corpse in the replicator to recycle for fuel.</span><br />
[05:39] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'd assume because no one's been here in like ages.</span><br />
[05:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...welp.</span><br />
[05:43] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Anyway, so, aside from replacing the alcohol, was there anything you wanted?</span><br />

[05:49] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Think about it.</span><br />
[05:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: If I went to visit my parents there, they would consider me an imposter. And well... I can't face that.</span><br />
[05:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And I'm basically something that Area 51 would lock up in a heart beat, experementing on me.</span><br />
