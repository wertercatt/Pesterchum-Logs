<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stands up and walks over towards FF --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, it's been a while. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: It's been what... almost a year?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, a couple months. Did you forget that one time when Isaac showed up and talked about that memo? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember you were there that time... I think ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Maybe. I don't remember...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: So... what ya been doing since then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been doing some investigating actually. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Oh...? Of what, if I may ask?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: The Red thingy I've been hearing bout?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nah, something relating to this weird "beta timeline" I've been hearing about. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the <span style="color:#ff0000">Red Rift</span> is probably gonna be a non-issue for a while. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, I've been using some borrowed skaianet viewport program to try and figure out what happened in that timeline. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Any luck with that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I figured that this alternate timeline thingy would sort itself out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a little bit, yeah. I posted the results on tumblr a couple weeks ago. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Also...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  hugs her --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  flinches for a second, and then hugs back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh, thanks. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  hugs back gently before unhuging. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Sorry if I startled ya...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright, just wasn't prepared. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's nnice to get a hug every once in a while. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: That it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so yeah. I'm mostly investigating it because it seems pretty interesting. Like, I know it probably won't have an bearing on us or whatever, but it's still pretty cool. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, maybe pretty cool isn't the right term... facinating maybe? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  checks her cllphone thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Guessing it's like watching a show, or something? Trying to figure out the plot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sorta, I guess. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, I must sound like a weirdo right now. This is literally worse than when people were practicing shipping a while back. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Hmmm... But there is probably a reason why we can see and talk to them... and i have a feeling it's not a good thng. And not really... wait, how does one pratice shipping?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you remember the shipping blogs way back when? that's how. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Oh right, that. That was silly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and, I think we're talking about two different things here. The Beta timeline was the timeline where the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span> ate the session... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ... uh okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you check out the thing that was posted about it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I submitted an exe file with the dynamic version and some other blog posted a video about it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Not really. Been busy, and forgot to check in on things, alot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ((Damnit- I got to go. Real life attacking... sorry... hope to talk/rp with you soon again))</span><br />
