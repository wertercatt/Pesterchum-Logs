<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah kinda ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...The entire session has reason to believe that she is the second half of the wonderful being we know as Chronos, Seth being the first half...</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...o_O;;; ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: . . . ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...CA was able to stop her for a minute and had a tense standoff involving giving her his sword and her pointing it at his throat...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Turns out her story was a lot like Seth's, being made fun of and ridiculed by the session as a whole. Not to mention that whole "put her soul in a frog" business with FL...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Oh, and there was also Mike!...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...From what I've heard, she apparently has the ability to negate any of Chronos' shenanigans? I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: cronak no power</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: waitwhat ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah, don't ask me...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...but yeah, tomorrow's going to be very up in the air...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...we were going to have the meeting but then all the Chronos shenanigans started happening...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: freaking chronos... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...and we don't know what Brae's final decision was...or what Seth thinks of all this now that he's back apparently...</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: cronak</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...It's just...ridiculous...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Anyway...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...There was another argument between some people and Ash and she disappeared from the memo...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...about how to deal with Brae...of course this was before everyone figured she was going to be involved with Chronos in one way or another...</span><br />
