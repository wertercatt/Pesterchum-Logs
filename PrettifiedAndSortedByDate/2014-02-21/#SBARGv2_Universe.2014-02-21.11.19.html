<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So whats going on with this /amazing/ trip that we got shoved into by time travel?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me guess, you haven't even gone down to the first planet yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...sorry for being rude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's kinda hard without enough of the group being prepared. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just pissed off that it couldn't have been a doomed clone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well that's kinda rude. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wow that came out wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now I feel guilty because I'm being rude torwards you, that I went through with being trapped by timetravel, and that I managed to make Ash sad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously does being a rogue of heart mean I have to take the blunt of everyones emotions?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again I was fighting the game more than the enemies it created.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like I bet there is a new notice on the patch notes</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I find it interesti ng how in a later part in My Immortal, when the "other author" attempts to make things revert to working according to harry potter canon, it actually becomes less interesting. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ive never actually read it</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Found it in a skaian castle.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (dammit, that didn't work)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: somepeoples fonts don't support fullwidth</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: usually it comes standard with MS Gothic/Mincho or something. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda wonder if there is a quirk that changes all text between two tags into fullwidth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably completely possible ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like a &lt;fullwidth&gt;tag like this&lt;/fullwidth&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably has to be one of those python-script quirks, like gradients...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like adds FEE0 to the letters in the area then stops doing that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: You have to make contact to use it?</span><br />

<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....mhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can we get a hope player instead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....like myself?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....PO is no where to be found.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....as far as i know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....we both share the same classpect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....and then some other chick has hope powers, who i dont even know where she came from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....so basically, i get to be solo hope player until other people show up to say otherwise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay PW, I have this wooden charm for you that should allow you to break through any magical barriers you would come up against.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....okay, ill stop being an asshole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you need to /believe in it/, other wise it won't work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....well, i dont have the hope powers like a page.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....but being a knight should give me a reasonable amount of hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....say, do you have anything for doom players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just make another Yolo drill</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....yolo drill?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOLO Drill.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....what is that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what the fuck is it with people forgetting things</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its that giant hope drill you made with PO</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....i wasnt sure if you were addressing an item for doom players of not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....that was Double Helix fraymotif.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....and we also added two-three rage players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we are going to throw it at whatever magical barrier is gonna keep you from saving Isaac and uh... whats his face.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....so it was basically a swirling drill of death, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....wait what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....Issac?</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....Isaac*.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....is that the odd Drifter dude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....what happened to him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fighting Brads friend in some sort of thunderdome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....why.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Point is, we are sending you in for backup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....now? or later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....because all i know is that Double Helix can only be performed with Two hope players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we only have one ticket.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....and a single hope player can do a hope-splosion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....but mine is limited due to my less amount of hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....but it just might work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AD, could we send in your bro?</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....i also want to ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....could, doom be of any use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....doom powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well we kinda need antimagic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....if we can find that thief of hope, i think we could pull off double helix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....i saw her at the bar one time.</span><br />
