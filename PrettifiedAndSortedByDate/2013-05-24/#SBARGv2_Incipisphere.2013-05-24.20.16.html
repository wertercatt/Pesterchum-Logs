<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: also what is this tablet?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: the 2nd goes to the perso you last contacted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  HOLD FF HE WOULDN'T KNOW WHO THAT IS AT THIS POINT</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ALSO I DUNNO CS BUT PLEASE CAPCHALOGUE IT FOR NOW</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  anywho FF is partly right</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  your second gate goes to somebody else's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  to be more specific it goes to SJ's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  which is the Land of Holes and Numbers</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: SJ is part of the AE net, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  now if you go to her land, and then take the second gate there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  actually yes that does go to AE's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and if you go through the second gate there it will go to DP's</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  which I believe is Moss and Vastness?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  also AE's is Trees and Mirrors I'm pretty sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aw man...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  but anywho once you get to LoMaV the second gate there will go to MA's land, which I just plain don't recall the name of</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Did Chelsea link her second gate to anyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I really hope not!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: There's a map.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  perhaps it would be better CS if I linked you to that</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  thanks FF</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: The land you want o hear towards is TT's.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  anyways, CS you see it right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's the Land of Roses and Ink.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  anywho FF is right</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  the reason I was explaining all that to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  is because I want you to take all those second gates to TT's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  we have a huge Headquartery building over there</span><br />
