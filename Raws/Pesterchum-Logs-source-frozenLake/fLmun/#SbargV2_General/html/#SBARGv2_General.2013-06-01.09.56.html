<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#19c800">CURRENT lackadaisicalLilliputian [CLL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: your sprite survived!</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: yaey!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not exactly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: how not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think of it as a factor similar to gameplay and storyline segregation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While the flash showed it surviving, in the roleplay, it didn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: ah ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...mostly because I didn't notice the sprite was cruxite the first time around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: I got it from the fact that there was someone with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: and you wanted to go with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, I never mentioned the "buddy" part was a dog named buddy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So therefore, it did not have the dog head...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Much like SJ's tigerplushsprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There were minor differences we neglected to mention.</span><br />
<span style="color:#19c800">CLL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, my sprite in my plot told FL to run.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This assumes that they managed to land.</span><br />
