[07:20] <span style="color:#f8c55f">CVD: Having to part with things is heartbreaking. I try to avoid it. Creating new life for everyone else to enjoy is much more pleasant.</span><br />

[07:28] <span style="color:#f8c55f">CVD: Still. One would have to be destroying it from all ends at once to make progress. I would not be concerned about such ideas.</span><br />

[07:35] <span style="color:#f8c55f">CVD: Elaborate.</span><br />
[07:37] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: As far as i can tell, this universe was made by the bunch of children running this bar. Since you have such powerful abilities, I feel compelled to ask you your origin.</span><br />
[07:38] <span style="color:#f8c55f">CVD: Ah. We are not from this universe. We originated in another.</span><br />

[07:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I think he means the nebula was transplanted from elsewhere?</span><br />
[07:47] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: That pile of rocks is our universe.</span><br />
[07:48] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Our space player fucked up so badly, that our entire nebula- one of the rocks- landed out here.</span><br />

[11:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just re-irritating for the record, I'm pretty sure it'd count as a Grandfather Paradox if CC's session was prevented from happening at this point.</span><br />
[11:37] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and what does that even mean?</span><br />
[11:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It means there'll probably be...hear me out on this.</span><br />
[11:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically means it's a doomed timeline if it's prevented, since you're here /in the past/ from it.</span><br />
[11:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: There'll probably be some absolutely ridiculous mental backflips on paradox space's part, but you'll probably end up still existing.</span><br />

[11:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't believe anything anybody here says about doomed timelines, so don't even count those.</span><br />
[11:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But you'll probably end up living.</span><br />
[11:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: as far as I know, Back to the Future-style person fading out of existence is /not/ a thing paradox space does.</span><br />

[11:42] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ...</span><br />
[11:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You can tell a lot about a person from the color of their hair.</span><br />

[11:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also, what shoes they wear, and how their elbows look.</span><br />
[11:42] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ..What does white hair indicate?</span><br />
[11:43] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Any number of things! From being old, being wise....to various scary things.</span><br />
[11:44] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ..Alarmingly accurate.</span><br />
[11:44] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: The scary part, I mean.</span><br />
[11:44] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Am i frightening to you Adal?</span><br />
[11:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll level with you 9 times out of 10 it means a special snowflake, the other times it means like...</span><br />
[11:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: They bleached their hair and something went AWFUL.</span><br />
[11:44] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Oh, no. Silas's mother has white hair.</span><br />
[11:45] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: She's terrifying.</span><br />
[11:45] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Ah.</span><br />
[11:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually wait, 8 times out of 10. The other time means cosplay.</span><br />
[11:45] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: What is cosplay?</span><br />
[11:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's short for costume play, it's where you dress up as various characters.</span><br />
[11:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: From various media like games, movies, comics, anime, or...books, sometimes.</span><br />
[11:47] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: So.... What does blue hair mean?</span><br />
[11:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, blue hair! I secretly love blue hair, but it usually means special snowflake or they're alternative. Y'know, emo, goth. Sometimes they're trying out dyes and decide blue'd be a good challenge.</span><br />

[11:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Did you mean your hair? I'm thinking of a lighter blue.</span><br />
[11:50] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Yes. I meant mine.</span><br />
[11:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ah, a darker blue. Sometimes it's just a style that's decently cool since like purple, it's close enough to black to be cool. Sometimes, but rarely, means a snowflake.</span><br />
[11:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hold on, lemme find a thing...</span><br />
[11:50] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I'm starting to think you like snowflakes</span><br />
[11:51] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: I assume most "unnatural" colors are a sign of snowflakes.</span><br />
[11:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yup.</span><br />

[11:52] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Mm. They are a tad bothersome.</span><br />

[11:53] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: So...do I bother you then?</span><br />
[11:53] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah, I just don't expect anything out of the ordinary out of you.</span><br />
[11:54] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: except somehow survivng an event from the past not happening apparently</span><br />
[11:54] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I would say that would make it quite un-ordinary</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Our ordinaries are different.</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: oh?</span><br />

[11:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So my ordinary, where I come from, would be waking up in the morning, getting some coffee, and then doing y'know, street gang things.</span><br />
[11:57] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ...</span><br />
[11:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And then I joined a research company on an internship and everything changed, then I played sburb.</span><br />
[11:58] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....</span><br />
[11:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then my "ordinary" became "horrific bullshit" and my "out of the ordinary" became my old ordinary.</span><br />
[11:59] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ...I see...</span><br />
[11:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like if I told you about a time where a wayward Life hero turned into a ball of cancer and exploded after being defeated by a Light hero who considered himself a knight.</span><br />
