<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: whats uplink?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, explain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, and the anchor point in those moments is the GROUND.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically, a simulator of Hollywood Hacking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause youre travelling along the time axis</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not the space axis</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, but at every moment, things are moving.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Meteors, Lands, the entire session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how would our spires work if our planets move?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its general relativity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, with my timeleg, it uses whatever I'm standing on as an anchor point</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this is a game</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And they always point at skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: general relativity stopped being general </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like a compass pointing at the north pole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so if I'm standing on the ground on some land, I'll reappear standing on the ground on some land</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: planets tilt along the axis</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even id that planet moved during that thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *if</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: our planets dont move man</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes they do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if they did the spires would move out of position</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless the spires always adjusted to point at skaia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how would that work then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /magic/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was proven in Caliborns session that lands move.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In an orbit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: they do move, but their spin is basically the same as how the same side of the moon faces earth</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and it's not really much of a spin, as the land's Dwelling Spire is actually considered the north pole of the land</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I thought they only moved because there was a black hole in the middle</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so they orbit</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: still</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the main point is</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a time player moves along the time axis</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not the space</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have fun being dropped off in space after the land moves under you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: I think its safer</span><br />

<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: to the same planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and what i mean is that yes they do have their anchor</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, say you adjust so you anchor to something other than your land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and that means when they travel along the time axis- oh quit your bitching -they have the same relative point on the space axis</span><br />
