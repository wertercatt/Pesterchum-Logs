<span style="color:#005500">CCP: um, I've been riding on her back the whole time. she was never in the car either...</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: CP, I Know you wernt in the car</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  spins in place on the kicktail, grinning. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: ((PK just called CP out on his/her strange confusing bullshit))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Lore dungeon, huh. What do we know about this place so far, anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: The dungeon is bellow ground and considered a treasure trove</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((you're the one confusing me bro... and I've said in several /mes already, I'm a guy))</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: The greatest Prize lays deeP inside. It is said to be a Pile of incredibly Powerful weaPons</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: ((I don't remeber CP coming to LoCaL liKe ever))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Sounds like a blast. What's the catch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((shrug.gif))</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: The weaPons are Protected by a fiece beast</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: I believe it may be a Dragoon</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Which is liKe a dragon but imPy</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Easy!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  hops off, kicking the board into his hands with a grin. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Like I said; What's the catch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  uncapchas a second board, this one with a minamilist sun design on the back. DUAL WIELD MOTHERFUCKERS. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Let's get a move on!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So where is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also wondering: why does dungeon entry require the sprites to come with?</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: The other catch is that once you enter its imPossible to leave untill you have layed claim to all of the treasure inside</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait wait wait, isn't that a loophole and we'll all die?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We can't all get the treasure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Every boonbuck, every random doo-dad, everything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: I hear that the treasure system is based more on the good loot</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's get some loot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Hell yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: And it just requires all the good loot to be claimed by one in the Party</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so in other words, empty the dungeon of anything that even remotely looks like treasure</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: We need the sPrites because if were not with them when we enter, everyone wil die if 1 Person forgot their sPrite</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: So CP, do you REALLY have your sPrite</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Cause if we die cause of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: This place sure has a lot of bullshit requirements.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: How'd you even figure them out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  equips the DRILLSTEIN, slinging it over his back with the deerscope, and rolling up and pinning down his sleeves. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: it listed them on a sign at the entrence</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#005500">[CCP]</span>  points down to remind you he's been riding on her back the whole time... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Good</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#02b5a9">[CPK]</span>  points due north --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: About that way for a mile</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#02b5a9">[CPK]</span>  releases his sprite and climbs on hopesprite's back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Let's ride</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: but on second thought, a no-exit thing sounds kinda risky... and I've watched enough Sword Art Online to know shit happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You...have a car.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why wouldn't you even get us closer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: OKay then</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#02b5a9">[CPK]</span>  gets in the car --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((plus, I may have to ollie momentarily, don't want to have to abscond mid-adventure))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((it'd be kinda weird IC in a no-abscond zone))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  hops on the Shiki 180, slinging the other board over his shoulder. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  rides the deerscope. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Get in them CP and I'll drive you</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#02b5a9">[CPK]</span>  and the three head north --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#02b5a9">[CPK]</span>  er Four head north --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#970025">[CRS]</span>  kicks off, flames licking at the back of the board as he surges ahead --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually, think I'll sit this one out. my "shit is about to happen that I'll have to abscond for" sense is tingling</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: OKay then CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Oi! Shame mate, we'll have to plunder together some other time!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: good luck though. also, have a few Jelly Ultra Shrooms I alchemized, they might come in handy</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: I'll call you when were doing an abscondable dungeon</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: mmk</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#02b5a9">[CPK]</span>  takes the shrooms --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: What are they good for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  uses the horns as a steering wheel, and kind of floats around like a Witch on a Broom on the Deerscope. So fast this thing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: refills half your health vial and pluck vial</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Also LoCaL dungeoners go here <a href='#sbarg_land_of_coPPer_and_lasors'>#sbarg_land_of_coPPer_and_lasors</a></span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#005500">[CCP]</span>  warps back to his dwelling spire to do a thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: ((Good, because I don't want to find out your soul was eaten by a laPtoP fan))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((lol))</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: Anyone got any other gifts to shower on us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((also, I think it's because I have firefox and chrome open at the same time, both of which eat ram like nobody's business))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Maybe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: B00KmON5</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's a book that fills up as you encounter Consorts, Imps, and other things.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Or at least, give you detailed info.</span><br />
