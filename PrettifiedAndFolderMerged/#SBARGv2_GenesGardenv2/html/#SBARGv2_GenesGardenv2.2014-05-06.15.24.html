[15:25:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  walks into the bar... and deploys a large device down on the floor, next to the TV. --</span><br />
[15:25:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  uncaptchas a massive crystal, and /slowly/ lowers it into place into the device, where upon the crystal lights up. --</span><br />
[15:26:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[15:26:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...whoa. what's that thing?</span><br />
[15:26:48] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Crystaline storage device... at a rather massive scale.</span><br />
[15:27:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow.</span><br />
[15:27:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I figure we should start using it as the hard drive for the Bar, for replicator data and for movies.</span><br />
[15:27:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I wonder which one of the two is gonna end up taking up more data.</span><br />
[15:29:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: replicator data has to store position and other info for eleventy buhmillion atoms per object. movies are a few gig. hmmmmmmmm...</span><br />
[15:30:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the "hmm" was sarcastic, in case it wasn't obvious ;) --</span><br />
[15:31:14] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, when you think about it, most objects tend to repeat the same few proteins and molecules over and over again.</span><br />
[15:32:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: True, it starts out as alot early on, but as you get more foods into the system, you would find that there is a large amount of shared data.</span><br />
[15:32:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, I guess so, but still, I think the objects would take up a lot more than the movies :P</span><br />
[15:32:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: True, early on.</span><br />
[15:33:17] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Then again, some people can be addicted to video quality.</span><br />
[15:33:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: and "have" to have it in Super Mega Ultra Hyper Mystic HD.</span><br />
[15:36:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay, if your megapixel needs exceed the resolution of /reality itself/, you got issues.</span><br />
[15:39:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Oh, they don't exceed reality. They just get exactly to planck length.</span><br />
[15:39:52] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Meanwhile, I can handle stuff sometimes on a /tiny/ screen.</span><br />
[15:40:02] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: 320x200, so to speak.</span><br />
[15:40:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... well still, exceeding the resolution of the /retina/ is still a waste, anyway.</span><br />
[15:40:52] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[15:45:28] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...How much power do you think one of those lightning bolts you can summon carries?</span><br />
[15:46:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno. I think that kind of thing boils down to "whatever power level the plot requires", like about half of Copland's commands do.</span><br />
[15:47:12] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...soo... over nine thousand?</span><br />
[15:47:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0070e0">[CFL]</span>  sticks his tongue out. --</span><br />
