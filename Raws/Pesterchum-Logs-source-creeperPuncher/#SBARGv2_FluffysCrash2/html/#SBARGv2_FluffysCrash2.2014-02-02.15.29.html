<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  most of the exterior is in shambles and looks like a very large object smashed into it. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  then the engine blows up. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  jumps back at the sound of engine-kaboom --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, you go try and get her out while I put out the fire...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  nods, floating over to the wreckage. Alright, how to do this...? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts drawing a few Waterspouts, redirecting the waterfall to extinguish the flaming bits... and trying not to drench EQ in the process --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor's <span style="color:#555555">[CFI'S]</span>  ship's fire is put out, but the whole thing is still smoking --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  uncaptcha's her epee and attempts to crowbar her way into the ship. pleasedontbreakpleasedontbreak.... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: The cockpit is wedged mostly in the wall, but part of the thick glass cover is still visible. Smoke is inside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  *** --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Welp. Sorry fluffy, but I honestly couldnt care much of the state of this ship anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  starts stabbing at the Glass Cover. Metal point vs Glass. Which will win? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: taking the Jaws of Life approach then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  the glass hardly starts to even dent. This stuff is used in space you know. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  sighs in annoyance. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Kimura, you got anything really really heavy and blunt on you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: can you find a small hole to get in? I might have to go the Mallet route...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oy... Uh, let me check.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  there is probably a way through the damaged engine. It blew most of the back side of the ship off. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  looks over the parts of the ship that are /not/ in the stone wall of the waterfall. Please have an exause or something- Or that. That could work. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Welp... Hope you like being in places that recently exploaded, CP!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...of course it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm not seeing many other routes, besides going through the used-to-be-engine route. Have fun!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does the shrinky thing and crawls his way into the not-an-engine-anymore --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  just tries using other things from her sylladex on the glass in the meantime. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor's <span style="color:#555555">[CFI'S]</span>  ship engine, or what was left of it, would exit out into the back portion of the ship where mantinence would be held. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor's <span style="color:#555555">[CFI'S]</span>  body could be partially seen through the thick smoke inside the cock pit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues walking through the cooridors to the cockpit --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  CP finds the end of FI's tail. It's not moving. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unshrinks and starts trying to pull FI out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  groans. It feels like she is stuck on something but the smoke is in the way. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws Galestorm, hopefully dispersing the smoke away from them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: any luck out there, EQ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  becomes visible... oh crap. Fluffy looks like she got a little impaled by the engine exploding behind her. One of the bars from her ship has successfully punctured and gone through her back, probably poking out her ribs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: /Nope./</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Wha...- Oooohgosh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  groans again. She is wearing her helmet still. Good thing too, the overhead panel looked like it came loose in the explosion and hit her head. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dammit, gonna have to pull a TF2 Surgeon Simulator here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  uncaptchas and props up the medigun, pointed at Fluffy, then switches to human form and carefully attempts to pull the bar out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Or... you could get her to a place that is not a crash-site to properly do that sorta thing firstly- er</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  covers her eyes nope not seeing that nope --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  the bar gets pulled out with a nauseating squelch, blood immediately starts flowing out of the wound and her body slumps. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  turns the medigun on full blast --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  is hit with the medigun blast and her wound slowly closes up, although leaving a small hairless patch where it was. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  appears to have been completely knocked unconcious. --</span><br />
