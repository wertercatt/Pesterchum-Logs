<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but half the stuff you do is completely tangential</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: as in object a is blocking objective b so you need to do quest c which requires item d that you get from donjon e</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: and so on</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: which makes the world feel so much more alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: tbh that's kinda convoluted in a tiresome way</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but modern jrpg worlds feel so player-centered</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think what SL's getting at is stuf that's unrelated to the plot that makes it feel like the plot isn't the only thing that matters. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: whereas stuff like ff3j really gives the impression that there are people and events that would still happen if you werent there</span><br />

Your past life diagnosis:<br />
I don't know how you feel about it, but you were female in your last earthly incarnation.You were born somewhere in the territory of modern North Australia around the year 1300. Your profession was that of a preacher, publisher or writer of ancient inscriptions.<br />
Your brief psychological profile in your past life:<br />
Timid, constrained, quiet person. You had creative talents, which waited until this life to be liberated. Sometimes your environment considered you strange.<br />
The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation:<br />
Your main lesson is to develop magnanimity and a feeling of brotherhood. Try to become less adhered to material property and learn to take only as much, as you can give back.<br />

well you tend to think with your class<br />
class is how you apply aspect<br />
