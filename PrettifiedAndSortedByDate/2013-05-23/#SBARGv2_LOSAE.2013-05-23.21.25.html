<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 LOSAE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#006b00">CURRENT nacaratVirtue [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  TRAVELING by hot air balloon, lands with a skid just outside Rob's house, the only occupant rolling and tumbling out of it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ok, I'm here and I brought the Life Shroouuugh... ouch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  throws the Life Shroom at RS immediately --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: { BRO? }</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: *</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is kind of bleeding out on the ground near the gate exit, jacket ripped in a number of places and burn wounds all over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: dude, hurry up and eat the life shroom already. it'll at least stop your hp loss</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the life shroom comes in contact and presumably a nice healing light washes over him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  or does it have to be eaten --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  because if it does --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is totally and completely unconcious --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  nah, just touching works --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: I have the burn salves and the organic bandages.</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Now we just have to Joshua Graham his ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  or idk, not sure how it works in paper marioverse but in this case yes --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  basically, it makes contact with you to cpatchalogue a la [S] ACT 4 walkaround, then it auto-activates when you hit 0HP and brings you back to 10HP and cures the Bleeding status effect --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  immediately steps into action, tearing off RS's jacket with a STRONG!pull, and uncaptchaloguing a wooden crate full of vials, salves, bandages, and kits. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Okay nurse, I need some help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  runs over and starts handing NV things --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  he's wearing a shirt under this jacket correct --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the concentration of burns are on his right leg and torso, by the look of it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  yes he is, albeit one that's been burned through in a number of spots and cut up in others --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  whips out a knife and hands it to CP handle first, tapping his chin for a few seconds before hastily and quickly bringing out 3 different salves and 2 kinds of bandages, tearing the shirt even worse. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Remove or roll up the right pant leg.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  rolls it up, considering it's the less-violent option --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  begins applying 3 different salves to the burns, then bandaging them up to the best of his ability, screw delicacy and tact lol. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: So how are the wife and kids?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  while waiting for NV to ask for a thing, uses Lv5 Sweet Feast to give all three of them a small HP boost --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Hand me the vial with the bottle drawn on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  applies the salve to the leg, and holds out his hand for the bottle, sitting indian style looking more focused than at all usual. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  hands NV all the bottles that look like that... you really oughta color-code these things better --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  frowns and looks between them, taking the yellow one and sprinkling the golden liquid on his leg bfore bandaging. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Camel piss, heals it all faster.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  makes a note to alchemize less-gross things for NV later --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  and also makes a note to chew his past self out for being a dumbass and NEVER THINKING TO CAPTCHAROID THE MEDIGUN FROM TF2 FOR JUST THIS SORT OF SITCH --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  would any of this hurt --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Kidding it's a thing called Djinn's Draught, it'll heal and set crippled limbs, but nothing but limbs. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  the salves would sting slightly, and the Draught would be feel like you're suddenly swimming in warm and fluffy jello --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  k then still out of it whee --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">FUTURE creeperPuncher [FCP]</span> 14:13 HOURS FROM NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- FUTURE creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[FCP]</span>  mirror-waps in with the medigun Past-Past Him forgot to make and uses it to further stabilize RS --</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FCP: *warps, even</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Perfect. I think he just needs rest now, hm. Any way to automate that thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  stares at his future self, realizing this is the first time he's met cross-timeline in person --</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FCP: oh, and when you're done here, next time you see FS, slap him for the Chugaaconroy-Tier pun he made about us being a Light Player who's prone to weird time shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  waves to FCP, setting all his bottles and bandages in the box. The first layer of bandage is organic, recovering lost blood then grafting on, 2nd tier bandage is a localized numb. Salves are just for burns. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Oh ahaha that was funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  what was that a whisper? A murmer maybe? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT nacaratVirtue <span style="color:#006b00">[CNV]</span>  smiles and sits back, setting down a brand new PATRIOTIC PARAPHERNALIA Jacket for him when he can move. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater's <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS'S]</span>  eyes creak open, still otherwise --</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">FCP: hooray, the gun wasn't a waste of ELEVENTY BUHMILLION RUST GRIST.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FCP: (yeah, you're gonna have to launch a mass gristtorrent drain of the session's rust grist when you get back)</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: Good, that means you're still alive!</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- FUTURE creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[FCP]</span>  hands RS a mini-vidwindow instead, with pester already launched --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  slowly reaches a hand up and takes it, sighing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#006b00">CNV: my pesterglasses aren't your prescription, but you could have them I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'll make something new soon, just need a temp solution</span><br />
