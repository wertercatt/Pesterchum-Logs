You see mold, WE. And cracked off-white tiles. And other suchlike things.<br />

After walking for a while down the passage, you come out into a large rectangular chamber that looks a bit like a lobby. A dusty window takes up much of the wall opposite from the passage you just came through, stretching halfway down from the ceiling. It's chipped in places and cracks form interesting weblike patterns in others.<br />
The rest of the room is made from that off-white tile-- oh look, it's the mold again! There are not one but three small black domes positioned on the ceiling in this room. The air here smells a bit fresher, possibly because of the vents high up on the walls. There's a door on each of the non-windowed/passageway walls, directly to your left and right as you enter.<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  follows WE into the left passage. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Two, four, six... seven. So then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads left, hands in his pockets --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  follows the left path wondering if it leads right to another room or not. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishDream <span style="color:#005d00">[CFD]</span>  looks around, scowling. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  goes right I guess --</span><br />
For those going LEFT: You enter into another passageway, though this one is erring more on the side of dim than dark, and it's certainly possible to see where you're going without tripping and falling flat on your face.<br />
The theme of cracked off-white tiles continues being a thing, and there's a bit less mold, though what mold there is forms interesting designs. Plus the security cameras (two, one on each end). Can't forget them. After a bit of travel, you come upon another door. It slides back into the wall when you approach.<br />
For those going RIGHT: You enter into another passageway, this one dark as fuck. You can't even see your hand in front of your face, should you be inclined to try. After all, hands. How boring are hands? They're pink, fleshy appendages. That are pink and fleshy and can pick things up and manipulate tools and… fingerprints, man.<br />
However, the narration senses that it's getting off on a tangent, and resumes describing the passageway. It's… dark. Really dark. Really fucking dark. That's about all there is to say.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  turns on flashlight again --</span><br />
… It's no longer dark. Now it's just a normal passageway. Assuming your "normal passageways" have an oppressively dank atmosphere, mildew, and faint skittering (or chittering) sounds from time to time. And security cameras installed in the ceiling. At the other end of this passageway is a door, which slides back into the wall as you approach.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  tries to smash the security camera domes on his way by them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  casually takes out Arthenial and smashes whatever cameras WE doesn't with the blunt of the blade. --</span><br />
The camera domes are smashable. Especially for WE. They don't seem to like Raz as much. Broken glass and wires everywhere.<br />
<span style="color:#005d00">CFD: ...lovely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  snrks and heads into the room to the left. The door just helpfully opened and everything :D --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005d00">CFD: now what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the narration underestimates just how strong this sword is. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, door. keep going?</span><br />
No, the narration doesn't care.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  raises an eyebrow behind his mask and nods, proceeding forward towards the door --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  suuuuuure --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishDream <span style="color:#005d00">[CFD]</span>  heads towards the door as well. --</span><br />
The narration pats RS on the head and ushers him forward.<br />
<span style="color:#005d00">CFD: ((just to let you know, gonna have to be afk soon, but the narration will continue anway. should be back within an hour and a half. Have Fun~!))</span><br />
The narration is omnipresent. It will never leave and you will never be rid of it. SUCKERS.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  crickets x131 combo --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005d00">CFD: ((even when it's a empty room?))</span><br />
The door is open, FS, FD. Assuming you possess basic motor skills, you're easily able to not only walk towards it, but walk right through.<br />
Empty room? Nonsense. They are filled by narrative fiat. The narration says that it is so.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishDream <span style="color:#005d00">[CFD]</span>  walks through it, flipping of nohting in particular. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  walks through the door that slid open upon their approach. He keeps his eyes open, looking for any threats in the room. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows them into the room --</span><br />
LEFT PATH: At first, it looks to be a room much like the one you were just in, except without a window. It's significantly brighter than the passageway. The most notable feature about it is the word "Epistheme" scrawled in what looks to be dried blood (but it could just be a unique strain of wordlike mold!) on the wall to your left.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  goes through the door then wheeeeeeeeeeeeee --</span><br />
And/or the trio of chests sitting just before the wall directly opposite you to your right. The four security cameras at various intervals around the room aren't noteworthy-- only omnipresent. Ssssh, no worries, only monitoring (for your own safety, of course) now.<br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFD</span> made <span style="color:#000000">MC</span> an OP.<br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFD</span> made <span style="color:#000000">TN</span> an OP.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...That word again.</span><br />
RIGHT PATH: Wow, isn't this nice? A room that isn't hellaciously dark. Instead, it looks to have the same sort of dank off-white tile that… everything else in this place does. Unlike everywhere else you've been, though, there's a rickety-looking wooden table in the middle of this room. Half a sheet of paper is lying on it.<br />
Something shiny might glint from under it. Only two security cameras are in this room. Just enough to make you feel watched. Now, isn't that such a safe feeling?<br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What word… Epistheme? Yeah...</span><br />

The security cameras stare back.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  approaches the table cautiously and looks down at the scrap of paper. Anything written or drawn on it? --</span><br />
It appears to be a key for the written version of Morse code. At least the letters from A to L. What an odd thing to find lying around...<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  picks up the scrap --</span><br />

It's important.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  looks about the room for anything else of importance --</span><br />
There are no wires going anywhere, but there's an odd-looking latch on the middle chest.<br />
The table… remains a table.<br />
But the narration notes down the idea.<br />
Thank you, user. Your contribution has been received.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  boggles at the table's tabling --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  fiiine opened te rightmost chest --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  examines the latch. Does it just open the chest or what? --</span><br />
The table is the most tablelike table in the history of tables.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  any other exits from the right room, or just the way we came? --</span><br />
RS: It opens with no problems. Half a sheet of paper is inside. It seems to be the key for the written form of Morse code. Or at least, the letters from M to Z.<br />
You detect nothing, WE.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  blinks, reaching down to pull the thing out and inspect it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  just wants to know if its what is used to open the damn chest and if its locked. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This is...</span><br />
CP: There's another door to the left of the one you came in, assuming your perspective is of someone who's just walked forward through said door.<br />
It is, and it's not locked.<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads over and taps open the left-most chest now --</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is avoiding the chests because she doesn't trust them* ... Why do you have Morse code?</span><br />
RS, It opens much in the manner you would expect a chest to open. You find inside a small scrap of paper reading "43770".<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  aaaaaaaaaaaaw no nothing. le sads --</span><br />

Oh, well, you were exactly right, then. Congratulations! At the end of this hallway is a door.

FOR ALL USERS.<br />
It's a large room, about twice the size of the ones you just came from, which might be a refreshing change from the narrow little passageways. Unless you're more agoraphobic, in which case, the narration apologises, for it really sucks to be you.<br />
You see the word "Epistheme" written again, scrawled perhaps in blood, perhaps in sentient mold (and isn't that a horrifying thought). And again. And again. Man, it's like this dungeon has some sort of theme or something. What are you going to see next, the cake is a pie? Er… lie? Mm, pies…<br />

WE, you see a door. On the ceiling. That looks to be more of circle than a normal, door-like door. Considering the fact that the moment you look up at it, it slides open and a metal ladder rolls down, it is, however, definitely a door. The ladder isn't the only thing that comes out, though.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  jumps back and floats up against the wall --</span><br />

When you have all entered through the door, it slides shut behind you. There is a dark passageway stretching horizontally out before you. There seems to be significantly less mildew and mold going on now. What a nice change. You come across a door… and this one has a keyhole, too!<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  joins Rob in examining --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  scoots past him to put the key in the door and turn it. --</span><br />
The door opens. And by opens, the narration of course means retracts into the wall once you have removed the key. It slides shut again once you have passed. There looks to be a room ahead…<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  beams and Captchalogues the key. "We're good!" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads through the door, smiling faintly. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  keeps following --</span><br />
This room looks to be at least a bit less dilapidated than the others you've encountered so far, at least. A wide black screen set at an angle on a sort of stone table and dominating at least a fifth of the opposite wall is most likely the first thing you see. A keyboard is in front of it, seeming to be set into the table as well.<br />
The computer itself is nowhere to be seen, potentially hidden within the stone, but the monitor is there and seemingly ready for use. There is incidentally a black dome in the middle of the room, though it looks different from the security-camera black domes decorating the walls (three of them, again).<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit's <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG'S]</span>  eyes go wide. "Computer!!!" --</span><br />

And not a security camera.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  bounds over to the computer immediately. --</span><br />

Epis agrees completely with FA's logic. The tentacle that skewers towards her is a high-five for being so right and not at all an attack. And if you believe that, the narration has a bit of swampland it would like to sell you.<br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, here we go with a fray I've never used before! /Davedevil Duo/!</span><br />

The deathtrap machine-things are not inside of the monster's digestive tract. It does not have buzzsaws in its stomach. Nor does it have flamethrowers. Those act as "teeth". There is a hell of a lot of acid, though… and ugh, are those /sores/? That's gotta be painful as hell, yeesh.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the aforementioned bgm begins, and both of them start fighting a lot more effectively due to Space shenans and luck boost --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  was thinking "chance of hitting enemy and chance of crit are boosted" --</span><br />
The monster also notes it hasn't been attacking FD and resolves to do so. Luckily, it has many attack appendages!<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  works on making a hole in the monster's stomach so he can get out and tear it appart from the inside --</span><br />

FD, acidy tentacles. And you're fighting with… your bare hands, due to a lack of weapon? Touching the tentacles? Oh god that's gotta hurt yeesh.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishDream <span style="color:#005d00">[CFD]</span>  hisses in pain, deciding to run after burning his hands badly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005d00">CFD: FUCK!</span><br />
Its digestive tract is also progressively getting a hole bashed into it, though WE would find himself soaked through with hella strong acid. Incidentally, strong acid dissolves fully in water, so is a strong electrolyte-- that means it conducts electricity well!<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  settles himself away from the tentacles and lowers his cloak to... OH FUCK ACIDSPLASHING --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  is promptly coated in acid and HOLY FUCK THAT SHIT BURNS --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishDream <span style="color:#005d00">[CFD]</span>  grabs FS and helps him out of the acid path, flying high. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005d00">CFD: You okay, man?</span><br />
Acid does burn. Luckily this is not /flammable/ acid. And acid by itself isn't the best electrolyte, but when dissolved in water, wooey!<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  pulls out the chain Gwyn's Regret and throws it up the monster's throat, ignoring the horrible pain as best he can.

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: AAAAAAAAH FU<span style="color:#730e8f">CK FUCK FUCK</span></span><br />
WE is yanked up the throat of the monster. The teeth of the beast have been shown to be buzzsaws and the like, though...<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  barely manages to not drop his weapons as he is grabbed out of the air by FD --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT theMaster... <span style="color:#000000">[CTM...]</span>  good job, you are now out... but some teeth are also broken and it's slicing through you badly... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT wayfaringEnder <span style="color:#2b0057">[CWE]</span>  starts grabbing the non-cutting base of the saw-teeth and tries forcing them back. His end goal being to break the thing's jaw. --</span><br />

The jaw is definitely being forced back, though. Ohhh yes. And add in some nice flamethrower teeth to roast its prey to perfection… well, then again, they're breaking too. Welp!<br />
