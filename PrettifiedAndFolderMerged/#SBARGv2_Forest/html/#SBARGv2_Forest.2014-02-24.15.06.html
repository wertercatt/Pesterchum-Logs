<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transformingSerpent <span style="color:#9acd32">[CTS]</span>  is... sleeping pretty heavily. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  pulls out the Lucky Mallet, sighing... "FL, what is /with/ you and your luck?" --</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ......AND I was right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could you get us out fast? Before it starts burning away at you?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right, let's go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  Vine-grabs FL onto him and flies out --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks around... assuming they're in the mouth and the transformation is internal as well as external, there should be a uvula to-- welp, that too. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of portals them outside &gt;_&gt; --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unshrinks once outside, letting FL assume the position of "on top of his hat" since that's probably safest at this point --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transformingSerpent <span style="color:#9acd32">[CTS]</span>  blinks at Kimura. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just glaring. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh sure, /now/ it wears off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...just be glad, for his sake as well as yours, it didn't wear off inside him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly mine, considering he could have just slipped back to his natural form.</span><br />
