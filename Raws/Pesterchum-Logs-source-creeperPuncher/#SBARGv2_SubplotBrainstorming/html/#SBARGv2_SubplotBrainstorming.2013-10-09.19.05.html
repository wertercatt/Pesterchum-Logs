<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, can I at least get a list of all the canon-breaking screw-ups I've ran into? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't really think you've done any kind of canon screw ups you've actually been a really good Time player, I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: only</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: As a /Prince/ that seems wrong, just from my viewpoint.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CP, on the other hand, I've probably actually been playing him (and Kutone) /too human/ actually... CP is half-wolf and Kutone's full-doge, they should be acting more doge-like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Truthfully ICly and OOCly I'm kind of against the idea of Time as a shackle of things that /must/ be done, alternate timelines and such, when my interpretation is more having the timeline naturally attuned to your actions and such.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's not been bad having all the predestination but it feels kinda off compared to, say, Dave, who had a ton of timeloops that just fit naturally with exactly what he wanted to do. I don't know if you've seen the Ultimate Riddle as explained by BKEW but, basically that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. if I remember the explanation for Dave correctly, as he went along his instincts became more aligned with the alpha timeline, so it wasn't that he HAD to do things, it was that what came naturally to him was what was supposed to happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And getting away from that being a Prince means a total departure for norms I think. I mentioned my interpretation of Prince of Time as, possibly, one who destroys inevitability, so if anything I felt like someone with that title should be about /breaking/ inevitability more then anything, looking at something that supposedly has to go a certain way and being able to go "No. Fuck that."</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: &gt; Chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Of course that's horribly OP but then, so are God Tiers. And its just my own personal take so not going that route works perfectly</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: &gt; paradox armor</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: &gt; fuck him</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah /pretty/ much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. that's true actually. SJ's been destroying /with/ inevitability, when she's equally capable of destroying inevitability itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: wait paradox armor that still never stopped being stupid like. FI having it because he was past him I can buy but /him/ having it doesn't really make sense, at least to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And that works too Kim</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and on a side note, I think the "blank timenote warps in when a retcon happens" is a pretty funny gag)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: God tiers and titles are a lot more overpowered and full of ability than a lot of people give them credit for.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if you guys want to know about the blank note thing, it's supposed to be a recipt that something was changed in a doomed timeline to allow the alpha to continue, though because they're doomed, they mostly happen behind the scenes and almost always off-screen. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ being a Prince is fun~ Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: huh... neat!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: CA shoosh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: NV was supposed to be a Prince of Space so I ended up doing all of his character development like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 's neat SJ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: then when Witch came around I was like "well that fits i guess"</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Being an Heir is fun~</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably the biggest thing I need to figure out is, what does "manipulation of luck/knowledge" /actually barking mean/ beyond "literal manipulation of physical Light, and subconsciously being OP at Mario Party"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  [Standing intensifies] --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the one with the furby fur attatched was the one where CC accidentally mistook an area memo for a memo-style memo, so the furbies between the wall were released ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I like Voiding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like Spacing because I realized today there is so much you can do with it outside of teleporting and changing sizes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft is that where the furby one came from? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like I never even imagined how OP that aspect is until today</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wherein NV unconciously achieves the Munchkin tiers</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: FL welcomes him with a scotch and crumpets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The JoJo tiers have been reached</span><br />
 <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Oh dear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like Munchkin tiers would be doing all this without realizing how ridiculously OP it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Hah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh man maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: JoJo tiers are embracing that shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Embracing it and stepping to the next level</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: But yeah, all the apsects are crazy in what they can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ kinda wish I had been a Prince of Space instead of a Prince of Mind Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ which funny enough I got legit Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ instead of just rolling with what I had done previously XD Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also something I've been thinking about lately: due to Brush Abilities (both Okami-canon and v2-custom), CP is fucking around with aspects he has no business touching technically. Galestorm (Breath), Veil of Mist (Time, though it's more of a mental-only effect), Brush Portals (Space teleportation)... and with items, he also pokes Void (Boo's Sheet)...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so he's basically almost the same Munchkin Tier as FL is, except a /lot/ saner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Artifacts are totally game I'd say, I mean Gamzee can used the timeboxes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, having a potion for nearly any occasion ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: use* whoops</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which I don't really like personally, since it cheapens a lot of things ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And I'm still mulling over making it canon that RS alchemized the Flame Regalia with a piece of MP's sword so that psuedo time stuff isn't so psuedo anymore</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: hahahahahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, that I just justify with off-camera alchemy experimentation :P and OOCly, it boils down to "health potions with oddly specific names".</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I thought head GM said you couldn't use out-of-Aspect artifacts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then those rewards from jovin's dungeon are out the window</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean those ball things? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and for the things I listed there, it's not like they're /explicitly/ tapping those aspects, they're just doing things similar to the respective Aspecty Things...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, forgot those ball things were even a thing</span><br />
