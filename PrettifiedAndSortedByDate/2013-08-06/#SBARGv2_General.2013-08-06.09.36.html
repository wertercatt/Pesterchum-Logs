Nat's last project was taking down Google, Yahoo, and several other popular social media sites.<br />
But it got kind of scrapped after her awakening.<br />
Dude, Alanna broke FB once because some girl annoyed her.<br />
So she bit her.<br />
And in biting, took out a /lot/.<br />
Didn't Draco aid with that or?<br />
Who even knows we helped each other out so much xD<br />
My timeline memory is fuzzy. Good times...<br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It had to do with SJ staying the night despite it not being where I live now and also the fact that irl my mom would totally not allow that. Anyway, in the dream, she stayed the night and she was sleeping. I never did sleep in the dream. I was disappointed that she was using my blanket but I touched her head and said "sweet dreams" or something but then she woke up and I was like "oops didn't mean to w</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, FF, the story's called "Witch Hunter". It's about what the title suggests. Evil witches waged war on humans and humans fought back. The main character is a really powerful hunter, though he prefers to nearly kill or deplete their energy rather than outright kill them. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Similar to a lot of series, the witch hunters are in teams, except the main character prefers to work solo. What's different is that he doesn't really care as much about protecting his friends as evidence when one of them was possessed by a witch and he decided to shoot anyway. Although subverted in that because of his no kill rule, it was a trainquilizing bullet. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so its basically the dnd alignment grid</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like she opposes North and South's plans and works to foil them and works with the main character, but also puts him into situations where it would cause him to go evil. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, another thing I forgot to mention, FF. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The witches all have one similar power where basically everyone is a summoner :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: With one summon creature :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And the main character is one of the few non witches who has a summon creature companion. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: theres actually a summoning idea ive wanted to see explored</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Get it out there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: have final fantasy-style summons where there's like a list that all summoners draw from</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but the summons in question are aware while they are summoned</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: they have to obey whoever summons them because summoning shenanigans</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think that's been done before. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Have you read Fairy Tail? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but they often have knowledge of the other side</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: because both sides are summoning them</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so summoning can be risky because the other guy can go "hey what did you see when they summoned you" and theyre bound to answer truthfully</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: hehe. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: In Witch Hunter, the main character's summon companion is a pumpkin head doll that turns into a loli. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But they both have the same personality. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The pumpkin head wants to beat up anything and everything and only doesn't because it's forced to obey the main character :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So when she goes into loli form, still the same :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i remember there was an anime that i heard about in an article about various japanese interpretations of beelzebub</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but i just now figured it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: its the feeling of wandering</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: anyone played ff3j?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: see ff3j has an overarcing quest to restore the 4 crystals</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but half the stuff you do is completely tangential</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: as in object a is blocking objective b so you need to do quest c which requires item d that you get from donjon e</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: and so on</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: which makes the world feel so much more alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: tbh that's kinda convoluted in a tiresome way</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: the thing with the japanese is that they're a graphomaniac nation</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but modern jrpg worlds feel so player-centered</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think what SL's getting at is stuf that's unrelated to the plot that makes it feel like the plot isn't the only thing that matters. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: whereas stuff like ff3j really gives the impression that there are people and events that would still happen if you werent there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: yeah that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i say this because im playing earthbound and it does the same sort of thing</span><br />
