<span style="color:#333333">CDS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: fun fact: there was someone called noodles in our group. I'm not sure if he literally turned into noodles or if he was controlling a bowl of noodles or what. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: or if the noodles were controlling him ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: it's confusing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: didnt kat have that thing with cheese</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i once knew a pasta wizard</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: yeah.... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: why did no one ever ship kat and noodles, you could call it Mac and Cheese</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: (i like cheese too. so does dad. and gramps. i think it runs in the family)</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: ...heh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: because noodles never really got into the shipping game ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((since Katie tells Patrick stories to cheer him up, he wouldnt know that TT died))</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: shame...</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that sounds nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: yeah, sounds a bit less eyesheering then my land</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: I never really introduced myself did I?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i'm an urban legend in some circles. i need no introduction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: lemme know when you're an urban legend and we can talk</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Already ahead of you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: I am a myth...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Hi, I'm Patrick "RN" Marshall, Hier of Hope from Merriam Kansas. The White Terror of the Land of Copper and Lasers, best known for killing the most black underlings in the session according to the official scoreboard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Nice...</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Hi, I'm Isaac Reuben. Pro LARPer. I mean. No. Not that. I'm a meddler. How's it goin'. It's my job to stick my nose where it doesn't belong-- in other people's business.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: just wondering, did you ever cut a record entitled "agonizing imp death screams" like Katie did or whatever? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: I</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: or is that just a weird sadistic thing that only katie did? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: what the fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: just asking ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: everyone knows this game just recycles the same ten screams over and over again, niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: three of which are the wilhelm scream</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: hey, they at least have variable pitches ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: and playback speeds ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Katie gave me a code for that cd at one point</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: I've never listened to it, or even alchemtized it</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh, including those that's like five of which</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: you do not know fear until you've heard imp_scream2 at low speed and low pitch ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: have you even looked into the game's code there's three identical sound files for the wilhelm scream</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: hey, we all are a little mad sometimes</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: I mean, I have an unhealthy obsession with cats</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: and yes, I have loked in the game's code before ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Cats...</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: WELL I</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: haven't so</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Cats are good...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: though only the SBRIGHT build ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i remember trying to trick a mob boss into playing the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it was hilarious</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: lol ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that... explains a lot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: Katie told me of the time she helped work on an unoffical expansion pack for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: reminds me of the time we found some big wig CEO who got into the game ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I think we had a litle too much fun watching him have a mental breakdown ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: it never got finished, and as far as she knows of it's just bitrotting away on an old broken laptop somewhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((*subtly refrences munstuck*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: what kinda expansion pack? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: ((haha, nice))</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: ha....</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: new roles, more underling types, even more batshit insane quests, and like a hell of a lot of bugfixes</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what explains a lot</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: also hi kim</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: seriously, she showed me the changelog and it looked like the changelog for if sonic 06 had an update</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: "fixed crash if you lick the right wall of your house before entering"</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: man, I should have called her up when I was bugtesting SBRIGHT, we would have kicked some serious code butt together probably ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: not really...</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Just having an off day...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: yeah, katie is a fucking genius at programming</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: just... a little more depressing than usual...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: welcome to my life</span><br />

<span style="color:#333333">CDS:  <a href='https://youtu.be/VT6LFOIofRE'>https://youtu.be/VT6LFOIofRE</a> The song that rings the most true to me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: intresting choice</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ:  <a href='https://youtu.be/3w6kiYVhI10'>https://youtu.be/3w6kiYVhI10</a> I think this one would probably be mine ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: but yeah, after Logan did his magics and I found myself on the battlefield I soon became Prospit's golden boy </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: or was that siren's theme song, I htink she linked me to that one one time ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: i still remember leading the charge like it was yesterday, good times those were</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ:  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkmxRiQZdb4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkmxRiQZdb4</a> this is probably one of my favorite reinditions of this song ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Battles huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: yeah, me and my platoon took out this whole group of black rooks, it was one hell of a time</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: it sounds like it.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: never really was one much for fighting over here. tbh I was more in it for the companionship of the group than anything. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Any battle fields of love out there</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: haha...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: eh, it never really heated up until after the session, and even now it's still just dating. That's okay I think though. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Must be nice..</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((just realized what would be one hell of a "only possible in dreambubbles" event))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((have RN relive his days as The White Terror of LoCaL, going through memorable charges on the battlefield leading his regiment))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: ((that could be fun, it's getting late tonight tho))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((I'm refering to later, likely as a kick in the pants once lost pawns returns))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((SUDDENLY: THINGS))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: sometimes you gotta know when to go to sleep ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Eh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: nothing can prepare you for the crippling emptyness of living forever</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Truth</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: do you know what I do to occupy my time? I create stuff. mostly just doodles and writing, but it really fills in a lot of the empty. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Not that I'll live forever...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: sometimes i think of still alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: The song?</span><br />

<span style="color:#333333">CDS: I see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: It's sorta funny ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ:  I could have gone on this huge journey to find a copy of earthbound ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: or you could just alchmey it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: but it turns out I don't have to ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: Ben has a copy ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#333333">CDS: later...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: meanwhile, siren had to go all the way to the backwards world, find a backwards copy, break her arms, and narrowly escape the group's destruction. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: that kinda sucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: both of us had p much made it our life goal to play a legit copy of earthbound one day ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I think I remember someone mentioning that in the vanilla timeline/probably also the strawberry timeline that it eventually got onto the virtual console. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (thank skaia that FNAF wasn't a thing during the pre-game, someone would've prototyped a goldren freddy or springtrap doll)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I don't even know what those things are and that sounds terrible ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#333333">CDS: Jumpscare animatronics that are slowly losing face value.</span><br />
