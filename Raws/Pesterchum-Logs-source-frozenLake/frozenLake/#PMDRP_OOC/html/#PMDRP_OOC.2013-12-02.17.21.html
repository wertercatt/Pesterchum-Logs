[07:09:31] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: well that didn't work...</span><br />
[07:09:33] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: … I like the team of three we have established ICly who seems to get along and not have hella drama or hella personality conflicts. Playing with them should be fun. I don't know about your "master plot" but don't see why it can't be flexible enough to include one or more small teams. I also have no idea what happened in the dungeons. This is disorganised as hell but you knew that anyway.</span><br />
[07:09:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and really, not everyone has to be apart of the important parts of the main plot. and really, do we want another colapsing DM due to player overload? ➜</span><br />

[07:10:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
[07:10:11] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: decide for yourselves</span><br />
[07:10:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i feel like small teams would also work for player gming</span><br />

[07:10:22] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...</span><br />
[07:10:22] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: 5 minutes</span><br />

[07:10:36] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: NOW can I say my thing?</span><br />
[07:10:37] <span style="color:#649993">CMM: lol</span><br />
[07:10:39] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Seconded.</span><br />
[07:10:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like so i wouldnt gm a dungeon i am also a part of i would gm some other team's dungeon</span><br />
[07:10:48] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: Carry on, RR xP</span><br />
[07:11:15] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Alright so, earlier I said the whole thing would be SL's chara falling into a Gate and getting sucked into the bottom level of some dungeon</span><br />
[07:11:20] <span style="color:#e809d2">CCS: i love da idea of team blank</span><br />
[07:12:00] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but how would he then join the team?</span><br />
[07:12:04] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: TEAM BLANK SWAzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz UH WHAT IM AWAKE</span><br />
[07:12:09] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: So maybe a random Trubbish friend of him ends up sending out the rescue request and the Guildmaster or someone below them gives the request to this group as means of maybe, a test for entrance into the Guild</span><br />
[07:12:15] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: … That's us in a nutshell, SE.</span><br />
[07:12:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i still feel like having him prove himself against a boss would be nice</span><br />
[07:13:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: perhaps he meets up with the party midway through a dungeon? ➜</span><br />
[07:13:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, perhaps there's something he's looking for that's at the end? ➜</span><br />
[07:13:30] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: yeah, maybe</span><br />
[07:13:36] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe have the dungeon settled by a gang of spritzee (great villainous species) and have him use his type effectiveness to prove himself?</span><br />
[07:13:53] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like they come in to save him and he's already fending off waves of spritzee</span><br />
[07:14:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that could be cool. ➜</span><br />
[07:14:08] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...So the question becomes "why did you even /need/ us"</span><br />
[07:14:16] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok</span><br />
[07:14:24] <span style="color:#000000">CCC</span> made <span style="color:#000000">AC</span> an OP.<br />
[07:14:31] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: see i have an idea of my trubbish being a "trapper" character</span><br />

[07:14:31] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: This is just personal nitpicking but I feel like that's not a /bad/ idea it could just serve to be a little further down</span><br />
[07:14:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so have him holed up somewhere surrounded by toxic spikes</span><br />
[07:14:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe the one who sent the signal didn't know how well he would fare there? ➜</span><br />
[07:14:55] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: Later on a big threatening thing shows up</span><br />
[07:14:58] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Like next dungeon that happens and he ends up invaluable in the fight because of his typing</span><br />
[07:14:59] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: and juuk trips</span><br />
[07:15:09] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Self worth = asserted</span><br />

[07:15:19] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but hed still need a reason to join up</span><br />
[07:15:31] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: wait hang on ive got it</span><br />
[07:15:44] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: see st never really had any friends or anything</span><br />

[07:16:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so basically just having someone treat him like a person would get him to cling onto the party for dear life</span><br />

[07:29:56] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: (SE how did I know that's what that video was)</span><br />
[07:30:03] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we  dont even know about anything plot-related</span><br />
[07:30:09] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: (magic)</span><br />
[07:30:10] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im sure it will be fine</span><br />
[07:30:20] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you even said you wanted a plot before we started</span><br />
[07:30:31] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AND that whole thing with the sigilyph was for the plot</span><br />
[07:30:49] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and the letter thing, as i understand it, was also for the plot</span><br />
[07:30:52] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i thought having some plot would be nice but youre worrying too much about it</span><br />
[07:31:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the plot stuff is still there, we dont have to worry. ➜</span><br />
[07:31:16] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'M WORRYING BECAUSE YOU ALL WERE SUGGESTING PLOTS ON THE THING</span><br />
[07:31:17] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if nothing else we should have some time to really establish and develop our characters before the plot starts</span><br />
[07:31:36] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: 'Scuse me. How does having a three-person team fuck up this ~grand plot~?</span><br />
[07:31:41] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i trust you with making a decent plot</span><br />
[07:31:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it'll be figured out. ➜</span><br />
[07:31:51] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AA THATS NOT EVEN PART OF THE ISSUE</span><br />
[07:32:07] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: THE ISSUE IS THAT APPARENTLY NO ONE WANTS AN OVER ARCHING PLOT ANYMORE</span><br />
[07:32:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I don't see how the plot is messed up at all. ➜</span><br />
[07:32:10] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: … I don't know what the issue is. Don't yell at me. That seemed, imo, to be why you were flipping your shit.</span><br />
[07:32:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats not what were saying ac</span><br />
[07:32:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: side-things can still happen. ➜</span><br />
[07:32:31] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: Why is the plot seemingly messed up?</span><br />
[07:32:34] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: I don't get it.</span><br />
[07:32:38] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: were saying we want some time to play around and develop our characters before the plot really starts</span><br />
[07:32:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's not like we need to adhere to the alpha timeline here. ➜</span><br />
[07:33:11] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i think youre the only one particularly concerned about an overarching plot dude</span><br />
[07:33:13] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: yeah, kinda like how in v2, the "main plot" (Chronos) didn't begin until /two months in/.</span><br />
[07:33:20] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that's exactly what you said</span><br />
[07:33:28] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: for right now? yes you are</span><br />
[07:33:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: later were all going to want something to work towards but for now we just want to rp</span><br />
[07:34:07] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AND EVEN SO, ITS GOING TO BE UNORGANIZED WITHOUT A BIG GROUP</span><br />
[07:34:31] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: … I don't know. I've seen big group dungeons. I think it'll be worse /with/ a big group.</span><br />
[07:34:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's going to be even more disorganized with a big group ➜</span><br />
[07:34:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why cant we have an umbrella group and then smaller groups</span><br />
[07:34:46] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: ^</span><br />
[07:34:48] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like the guild setup in explorers</span><br />
[07:34:50] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Imagine having a bunch of groups with a bunch of different things to do trying to share a fucking memo</span><br />

[07:35:50] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: relax</span><br />
[07:36:15] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: How can I relax knowing that apparently my idea for a huge group was apparently bad</span><br />
[07:36:41] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok you need to realize that as gm you have to roll with the punches</span><br />
[07:36:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's just one idea in a bunch of ideas. not everything can go according to plan. ➜</span><br />

[07:43:33] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: suppose he gets a valuable item stolen and goes to put out a mission for it</span><br />

[08:03:41] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: please</span><br />
[08:03:52] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: I haven't played Explorers of T/D/S through but the way I figured it the Guild serves as the hub of things, wherein mons/teams are trained and shit</span><br />
[08:04:27] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: So the way I figure it everyone could start out having to sign up with the Guild and from their building up unofficial teams could be a thing, while everyone's a part of the Guild at large and that could facilitate larger events</span><br />
[08:04:45] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: While still allowing for teams to take on jobs in small groups, and such.</span><br />
[08:04:52] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: No</span><br />
[08:04:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why not? ➜</span><br />
[08:04:57] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: If we're doing the guild</span><br />
[08:05:04] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: there are going to be actual teams</span><br />

[08:05:16] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...Um?</span><br />
[08:05:18] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: What?</span><br />
[08:05:29] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: it doesn't make since for a guild to just have unnoficial teams, to me</span><br />
[08:05:36] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Why not?</span><br />
[08:05:41] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: I'm /pretty/ sure that's how it works in the games</span><br />
[08:05:42] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: did the actual game with a guild do it?</span><br />
[08:05:45] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Yeah</span><br />
[08:05:48] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Let's be at least a bit canon</span><br />
[08:05:50] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: no it isn't</span><br />
[08:05:51] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: No, not exactly.</span><br />
[08:05:56] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: they had official teams</span><br />
[08:05:59] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its never really said</span><br />
[08:06:03] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Okay they can be official teams</span><br />
[08:06:08] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: good</span><br />
[08:06:09] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: But then again, there are rescue teams that are not part of the guild.</span><br />
[08:06:10] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Man I'm so not even worried about terminology</span><br />
[08:06:24] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Yeah there are teams not part of the Guild but those are teams with /experience/ I think</span><br />
[08:06:33] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: Plus, you manage to form an independant rescue team in the first game.</span><br />
[08:06:35] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: no</span><br />
[08:06:39] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: Team blank is the most talented team</span><br />
[08:06:49] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: And this doesn't exactly conform to any /one/ game.</span><br />
[08:06:51] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: From what the wiki says Teams train with the wiki and can test at some point to graduate from the Guild and become independant</span><br />
[08:06:52] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i'm pretty sure all teams that use the board in the guild are under its jurisdiction</span><br />
[08:07:07] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Okay that works.</span><br />
[08:07:13] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: like how Zangoose and his team tried to fight to get the full share of money from their missions</span><br />
[08:07:19] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and failed immenesly </span><br />
[08:07:19] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: That's more or less exactly what I intended yeah</span><br />
[08:07:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, that makes more sense. ➜</span><br />
[08:07:51] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah alright</span><br />
[08:07:53] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...That's more or less exactly what I was pitching but okay.</span><br />
[08:08:17] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Except the unofficial teams are official, alright.</span><br />
[08:08:25] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: And thats /exactly/ why Vitreus doesn't want to be part of an all powerful orginazation that can turn down jobs that don't give rewards on a daily basis.</span><br />
[08:08:33] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: the first game didn't have a guild even set up</span><br />
[08:08:35] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im just gonna fuckin introduce st already</span><br />

[08:09:12] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: After all, in the first game, there were jobs without rewards.</span><br />
[08:09:19] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: but in the second, none of those turn up.</span><br />
[08:09:21] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: at all.</span><br />
[08:09:26] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: Blank's entire thing is "omg they don't take people with money? ROBIN HOOD TIME".</span><br />

[08:09:49] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: ...I... don't really think thats it.</span><br />
[08:10:08] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: if we're having guilds, just do the guilds like in PMD2</span><br />

[08:31:35] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: ...we don't have to be /limited/ to three mons per team</span><br />
[08:32:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, in the first pmd, wasn't there like, up to six if sizes worked out well? ➜</span><br />
[08:32:02] <span style="color:#049bc5">CBS: I could but BS would admittedly require convincing</span><br />
[08:32:11] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: up to 4</span><br />
[08:32:15] <span style="color:#049bc5">CBS: cuz like I couldn't see him just up and joining a team</span><br />
[08:32:15] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: with a 6 star limite</span><br />
[08:32:41] <span style="color:#049bc5">CBS: I'll just figure stuffs out though as things happen x3</span><br />
[08:32:42] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Ooh-kay we could probably stand to hold off on teams for at least one or two more explorations. With everyone as part of the Guild they can take missions in whatever format they like</span><br />
[08:33:07] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: As part of a team or with any other person in the Guild as an unofficial grouping, like whatever feels right.</span><br />
[08:33:21] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: "with everyone as part of the guild"</span><br />
[08:33:27] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: /riiiight./</span><br />
[08:33:28] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: And the Pro Bono listing solves the issue of people worried about reward-less missions</span><br />
[08:33:41] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: ...But that</span><br />
[08:33:42] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...Is there a problem with everyone being part of the Guild BF?</span><br />
[08:33:43] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: ...</span><br />
[08:33:48] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: … yes.</span><br />
[08:33:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not everyone wants to join the guild. ➜</span><br />
[08:34:06] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: Rell believes the Guild doesn't help people without money; he refuses to join dose bitches.</span><br />
[08:34:20] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Well, like I said, Pro Bono board</span><br />
[08:34:20] <span style="color:#828282">CSE: Same for Juuk</span><br />
[08:34:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and really, not all guilds need to run the same as wigglytuff's from pmd2 ➜</span><br />
[08:34:49] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: Which is based on something that Vitreus said.</span><br />
[08:34:50] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Or just missions marked as rewardless, either works</span><br />
[08:34:59] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Yeah to what SJ said</span><br />
[08:35:06] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: bf, st, and ie should form a team</span><br />
[08:35:18] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: BF, Rell hasn't interacted with the Guild.</span><br />
[08:35:23] <span style="color:#ccccff">CAA: He believed you.</span><br />
[08:35:32] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Oh you /you/ fucked it up.</span><br />
[08:35:36] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: *so</span><br />
[08:35:48] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: Well, its past experience from BF's side.</span><br />
[08:35:57] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: and besides, teams don't mean you can only work with them, I'm thinking that as a whole we'll still be interacting as a group for the most part.</span><br />
[08:35:58] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: A missing father is no way for a kid to grow up.</span><br />
[08:36:03] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...:\</span><br />
[08:36:17] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: kind of like the teams in v2 (there I go with the sbarg analogies again)</span><br />
[08:36:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apprehensiveAbra <span style="color:#ccccff">[CAA]</span>  knows nothing about Guilds in /or/ out of character. --</span><br />
[08:36:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was gonna mention that. ➜</span><br />
[08:36:56] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: I figure everyone being a part of the Guild is most condusive to that, CG. My thing is I just personally like the structure of everyone as part of the larger Guild and then forming Teams under them</span><br />
[08:37:13] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: And the mechanic of having to work your way up in skill to strike out as an independant team</span><br />
[08:38:15] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: see, the thing is, in the games, other than one plot based mission in the first game, every mission has rewards.</span><br />
[08:38:34] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Well we don't need to be the game god</span><br />
[08:38:36] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: And well, the rewardless mission was the client coming directly to you asking for help.</span><br />
[08:38:55] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: What are you more interested in /utter/ fidelity to every single game mechanic or /a fun and inclusive RP/</span><br />
[08:39:18] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: It's not a federal issue to tweak things for the sake of that second one or at least I don't think so</span><br />
[08:39:29] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: I am interested in having a fun and inclusive RP while keeping themes from the games.</span><br />

[08:51:36] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: One day in, not /even/, and we have a ragequit.</span><br />
[08:51:39] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: That's gotta be a record.</span><br />
[08:51:49] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...And I seem to have stopped giving a fuck WELL THEN.</span><br />
[08:51:54] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: ...Actually, this was the second day.</span><br />
[08:52:03] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: And I half ragequit first.</span><br />

[08:52:11] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: 1.5 ragequits so far.</span><br />
[08:52:16] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: ...Moving on.</span><br />
[08:52:19] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he seemed like a cool guy too</span><br />

[08:52:35] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: So I'm highly uncreative and thinking, Scizor for Guild leader</span><br />
[08:52:38] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: BF, you only "ragequit" because of something the actual quitter was doing, so I wouldn't exactly count yours...</span><br />
[08:52:47] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Maybe it could be something less obviously cool though, that might be better</span><br />
[08:53:22] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: Do a Rhydon leader.</span><br />
[08:53:37] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: As it was the first pokemon ever coded.</span><br />
[08:53:47] <span style="color:#78a0be">CBF: in the games, that is.</span><br />

[08:54:22] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: That uh. Works, I guess, if for really neckbearded reasons</span><br />

[08:55:59] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: (but yeah, should we anticipate AC coming back or not?)</span><br />
[08:56:14] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: (Meh.)</span><br />
[08:56:30] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: (Don't really care one way or another personally, if he does he does, if he doesn't he doesn't)</span><br />
[08:56:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CBF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[08:56:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Personally, I didn't think he did that good.</span><br />
[08:56:57] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Alright so people were curious about why even bother joining the Guild, the way I see it they could probably provide starter equipment and berries, stuff of that sorta</span><br />
[08:57:33] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: I've half a mind to show up with Mr. Rhydon Guild Leader to lay things out but I guess that's dependant on no objections to what I've laid out</span><br />
[08:57:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Vitreus just crashed asleep.</span><br />
[08:58:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So maybe we should save this for the morning?</span><br />
[08:58:32] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably. ➜</span><br />
[08:58:48] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: So the Guild wouldn't function /exactly/ like in the games but it'd be pretty damn close. The way I see it is, anyone who wants to become an explorer and take on postings has to sign up with the Guild, and to go independant you need experience under your belt and to have passed a test</span><br />
[08:58:53] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Yeah that's fair enough</span><br />
[08:59:06] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: But I'll just get through this real quick right now t see if there are any objections</span><br />
[08:59:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:59:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That doesn't make sense.</span><br />
[08:59:41] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: It doesn't?</span><br />
[08:59:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, logically.</span><br />
[09:00:06] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Why not?</span><br />
[09:00:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless the world is in a stronghold by the rescue teams in a government that prevents freedom of choice.</span><br />
[09:00:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, whats keeping someone from just, putting a sign up at the house and forming a rescue team?</span><br />
[09:00:57] <span style="color:#dc9e6b">CCG: yeah</span><br />
[09:01:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would the guild crash down the door and lay down the law or something stupid?</span><br />
[09:01:12] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: I guess not.</span><br />
[09:01:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What the Guild does is /sponser/ your team.</span><br />
[09:01:46] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: But the job posting is in the Guild isn't it? When people have a request they go to it to post it there more often then not. And for the people without means of payment, there's the Pro Bono thing too</span><br />
[09:01:59] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah basically what fl says</span><br />
[09:02:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, to fit with FL's plot, the Pro Bono thing... might not have been there three years ago.</span><br />
[09:03:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or rather it was, its just noone gave a fuck.</span><br />
[09:03:24] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Either of those, why not.</span><br />
[09:03:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe both.</span><br />
[09:03:39] <span style="color:#2cc772">CRR: Could be rationalized as the Guild gaining a new leader in that period, sure.</span><br />
[09:03:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At the same time.</span><br />
[09:03:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[09:03:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
[09:04:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyways, night.</span><br />
