[07:24:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and then five thousand after that</span><br />
[07:25:05] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  sighs. --</span><br />

[08:15:15] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: And there is a strange young lad outside, yes.</span><br />
[08:16:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "on something" as in "am I being affected by something that alters perception?", which is no.</span><br />
[08:20:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((tea set))</span><br />
[08:20:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( tea kettle ))</span><br />

[08:30:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:31:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The kind that isn't really a spellcaster.</span><br />
[08:32:14] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: ...You should be dead, then?</span><br />
[08:32:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not really a spellcaster, more... divine in nature.</span><br />
[08:33:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  winks. --</span><br />

[08:37:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just... waves a hand, it bursting into flames. --</span><br />
[08:37:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about now?</span><br />
[08:37:59] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: . . .</span><br />
[08:38:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  snaps his fingers, both of his hands bursting into flames. --</span><br />
[08:38:29] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: I'm flattered you'd go through the effort to steal one of my favorite spells.</span><br />
[08:38:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just... sets his entire body on fire. --</span><br />
[08:38:35] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: And yet. . .</span><br />

[08:41:15] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Are you trying to impress me?</span><br />
[08:41:20] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: It's not working.</span><br />
[08:41:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you going to continue trying to one up me, or do I need to pull out a jar and stick you in a time out?</span><br />
[08:41:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, I worded that wrong.</span><br />
[08:42:30] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: Pull out a jar and--</span><br />
[08:42:31] <span style="color:#438d15">CCP: What.</span><br />
[08:42:38] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT companionlessPuppeteer <span style="color:#438d15">[CCP]</span>  stares blankly. --</span><br />
