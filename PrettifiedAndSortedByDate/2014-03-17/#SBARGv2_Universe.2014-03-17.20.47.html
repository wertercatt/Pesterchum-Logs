[03:11:06] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((1))</span><br />
[03:11:08] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((it's 1.))</span><br />
[03:11:12] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: ((<img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' />))</span><br />
[03:11:31] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: negative 46</span><br />
[03:11:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, potato over the square root of negative Oni Island.</span><br />
[03:11:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what is it right now?</span><br />

[03:12:06] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That's so dumb.</span><br />

[03:17:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, do you think the Luck stat might be mentally based in origin?</span><br />
[03:18:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I suppose it could be.</span><br />
[03:18:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...If so, I have a theory that places the blame on the AU Machine.</span><br />
[03:20:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...because so many corrupted AUs fried your thinkpan?</span><br />
[03:29:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, are you sure I should drink that??</span><br />
[03:29:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, he said it was the paralysis-cure and swelling heal, and it smelled okay to me...</span><br />
[03:30:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah but not all medication is drinkable.</span><br />
[03:30:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like... ointments.</span><br />

[03:42:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but uh, It didn't /have/ to be a corrupted one... just an AU that just went wrong on so many levels.</span><br />

[03:44:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay... answer this question so I can stop being worried about my own well-being: was it an AU that I was also playing, or were you the only player in it?</span><br />

[03:46:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it started messing up before you got in your first AU, correct?</span><br />
[03:47:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... well, the first one I know we did as a group was the Half-Life one, and Notepad fucked that place up...</span><br />

[03:48:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( You might also want to look through the beach to grass tiles, and see if there is anything that could smooth that out.))</span><br />
[03:49:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm not worried about the luck-stat thing, I'm reasonably sure my claspect gives me de facto immunity to that being broken.</span><br />
[03:49:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm worried about if subconscious insanity can be caused and/or transmitted by the machine.</span><br />
[03:51:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it would have to have been that Animal Crossing AU possibly.</span><br />
[03:51:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I'm betting it wasn't that one.</span><br />
[03:51:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, I /know/ I wasn't involved in that one...</span><br />
