[03:23] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0070e0">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:23] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: hey kimura.</span><br />
[03:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Did you happen to keep the two halves of that door?</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um, which one?</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: the one that was /supposed/ to work between the session and this planet.</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I still have the Starter-side door, if that's what you're asking.</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: didn't you get the other side from the last person who came through?</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we'd need Emmy or someone else to huck the Skaia-side one through the End Game Door...</span><br />
[03:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I think it was AA.</span><br />
[03:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (the cyan one)</span><br />
[03:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh. uh, don't remember actually.</span><br />
[03:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I vaguely remember that being a thing, yeah. not sure if actually did it or not))</span><br />
[03:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: either way, could I examine it perhaps sometime?</span><br />
[03:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, sure.</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Its just... Kimura, remember that one door that caused the entire fiasco with the mew and mewtwo?</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........yeeeaaah?</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what about it?</span><br />
[03:32] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, it got me thinking... perhaps when the AU Machine is functioning perfectly again, perhaps linking up a door construct inside of it with one outside might...</span><br />
[03:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
[03:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the problem with that is, door pair linking takes place /at alchemization/. so you'd have to actually gank a Digitizing Laser from a Tron AU and get the other door into the sim that way.</span><br />
[03:38] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...or just store the door in the captcha system that I had set up!</span><br />
[03:38] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...and now I'm terrified.</span><br />
[03:39] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: What would happen if I was using the AU Machine and opened the door to walk out of it?</span><br />
[03:39] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (@_@)</span><br />
[03:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that, I actually do have a decent idea of. it'd likely be equivalent to the "Translation" program on Code Lyoko, which let them materialize their Lyoko avatars in the real world.</span><br />
[03:41] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...and then if that one did an au... okay, my heads spinning from the level of recursion going on here</span><br />
[03:42] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And then there is the question of what would happen if the AU ended while it was... outside the AU.</span><br />
[03:42] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (#thingswedonotwanttofindoutabout)</span><br />
[03:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: first one - translated avatars can't enter the Scanners, and probably wouldn't be recognized by the helmets. second one - it'd probably just devirtualize if the originating sim ended.</span><br />
[03:44] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...probably?</span><br />
[03:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the other possibility being that the sim /couldn't/ end unless any avatars outside returned or were devirtualized. AND that any objects brought from outside were taken back out.</span><br />
[03:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: or third, the connection is broken, and we have a second version of me.</span><br />
[03:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Or one or two corpses.</span><br />
[03:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...dammit, now I want to see if at some point in "Code: Total Drama Reality", they have to Translate from within the TDR sim (which uses a helmet system similar to the AU Machine, actually)</span><br />
[03:49] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Plus, wouldn't objects inside/outside the sim undergo slight changes, such as slight gain/loss of matter?</span><br />
[03:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...whatever you do, don't eat or go to the bathroom while going through the door into the au machine</span><br />
[03:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........fuck.</span><br />
[03:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: don't do that either</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...yeesh, if it dematerializes, if you were in there too long, parts of your cellular structure would be... ripped apart.</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: F_L</span><br />
[03:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...alright, I got a test to do when the au machine is fixed.</span><br />
[03:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: go in, grab an iron ingot from a minecraft au, run out, and then turn off the au</span><br />
[03:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, sounds simple enough.</span><br />
[03:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I want to wait until its fixed though to avoid the virus getting out.</span><br />
[03:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Like, imagine the virus getting out in the form of say, a digimon.</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: D-Reaper scenario there.</span><br />
[04:35] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...Kimura?</span><br />
[04:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
[04:38] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Sorry, just was checking to see if you were alive</span><br />
[06:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...I'm going to rest.</span><br />
[06:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk, later FL</span><br />
