<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How long ago was that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF: I found some sort of "Code Room" in the basement of the castle. if my theory's right, we can use it to continue modding and fixing the game</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I would offer you some grist, but I'm gonna need all the grist I have (and can borrow.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been thinking, now that the gates are out, I might need to make some way to fly somehow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wouldn't do that, the glitch might cause it to break the universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ya can always make an unreal van.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, why not... some mechanical wings? Or a hot air balloon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was thinking of maybe something small</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ROCKET BOOTS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hot air balloons have a tendency to fucking explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: something with manuverability</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or rocket gloves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well, I'm gonna try anyways. First things first. Gonna make the KilladoStick. or The Jeweled Sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: SJ, how about a hover Chair?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait wait...</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: .../Really/ don't think that's a good idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we get it, your fancy supership</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps a gravity deflector?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alright full disclosure, I never beat Heaven's Feel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But I'm relatively familiar with the mechanics behidn everything worth knowing in it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the what</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's a Type-Moon thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#e12d00">CURRENT alternateVermin [CAV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: Icarus flew high on his paper wings, he flew too high to the sun. Only to let them burn up in the atmosphere and to be sent spiraling down into the raging torrent below.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What the worse that can happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...other then being forced to crossdress.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Type-Moon works have a really interesting system of magic and magecraft. Technically what most people do falls into the later category, True Magic is a completely different class that few to none can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1: Said wings are metal, not paper or wax.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2: There are other options.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How about breaking reality such that every possibility happens at once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but that was because the chump was rubbing it in, and Chronos was still at the wheel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Basically, True magic is the immpossible, SJ.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: I can assure you FF. Magic is in fact possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Hmm, I forgot that was a thing. Uh, a while ago, Kimura set up a dreamself/realself communication line thing to check in on LOSAC while he's on Prospit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS QUANTUM FIELD MANIPULATION.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NOT MAGIC.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny that, getting hung up on the specifics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: He says that the place is still intact, but a fair amount of carapaces are basically flipping the fuck out over Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Technocraft you could call it, to mirror Magecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: No, in the type moon universe, true magic is stuff that even MAGIC can't do. Like ressurecting the dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...okay, I need to stop being a type-lunatic for a moment. Sorry.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But then that causes me to wake up...</span><br />
