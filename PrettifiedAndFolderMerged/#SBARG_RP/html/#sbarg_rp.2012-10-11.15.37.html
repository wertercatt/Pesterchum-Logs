<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, do you have anything that would corrospond to ice?</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Im want to go with the two extremes with two swords.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fire, and Ice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I'm a breath player. The most badass weapon I have is my kernelsword. Sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: nothing elemental</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dang it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I made my fire sword, but I want something that will freeze enemies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: try using a video game</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: somehow</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: when alchemizing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I barely have any items for alchemy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Most of my items got destroyed, or are somewhere in the veil, shrunk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still gotta go back and save it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time travel, its not really my thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: same here</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#655a57">CURRENT nearlyNonexistent [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: If I had to time travel, everyone would die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: A million times.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I was lucky to remember a few codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I can't really make much alchemy wise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: because I would create so many doomed timelines to get a huge army</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be nice to go back and get my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: that would be nice, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: + everything inside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: the best way to alchemize is</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: get a random number generator</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: then type in random letters based off of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and guess the codes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: then run like heck before whatever horrible thing you created explodes</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: If you need anything specific I have my planet + house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tried that, got explosions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#79030f">CCL: I might have what you want</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I discovered that an items captcha code corrosponds to its upc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, the upc is the captcha code in hexadecimal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: I have no idea what a upc is, and I probably never will.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, some items wouldn't have a upc...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but would those items really get sold in stores</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: if they sold</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: jetpack computer chairs in stores</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: that would be so awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Really, who would sell jetpacks to the general population?</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: never mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: if everyone flew like me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: there wouldn't be an everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: knife &amp;&amp; tab</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: just yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: the STAB can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I got tab once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: it's full of lies</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: LIES</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: sugar free lies</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: which is why it's the perfect thing to stab with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its delicious!</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: why do lies have to be so delicious</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: It's like cake.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: hmm</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: if you took a captcharoid of a computer showing a file</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: would you get the computer or the file?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I would need the code for a camera.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that its an &amp;&amp; with a captcha card.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: prospitians</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: why do you not have cameras</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: seriously, you need better technology</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its only 1/256 combinations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have an alchemiter watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: you only live in a maaagical world and see Earth in the clouds</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: er</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: do you?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: either way they get clouds full of knowledge</span><br />
<span style="color:#655a57">CNN: they should have basic utilities</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess.</span><br />
