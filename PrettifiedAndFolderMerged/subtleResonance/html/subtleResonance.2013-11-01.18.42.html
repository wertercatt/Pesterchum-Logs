[06:42:48] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: So.</span><br />
[06:42:51] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: Am I still a dead man?</span><br />
[06:43:08] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: It'll be funny if you actually continue along that line.</span><br />
[06:43:25] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: But you are one lucky little plebe.</span><br />
[06:43:36] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: Good thing Bats was there.</span><br />
[06:43:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Eh.</span><br />
[06:44:02] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: Otherwise, that might have actually been considered Heroic.</span><br />
[06:44:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I can wait a few trillion years for you to die.</span><br />
[06:45:03] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: A few trillion years? Impressive conviction.</span><br />
[06:45:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, I figure it would take that long for the new universe to die.</span><br />
[06:45:58] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: You won't even remember this world after that span of time.</span><br />
[06:46:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah.</span><br />
[06:46:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I won't.</span><br />
[06:46:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: All of us are going to die SR, its just going to take time.</span><br />
[06:46:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: A /lot/ of time.</span><br />
[06:46:52] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: So very deep. Believe me, I know far better than you.</span><br />
[06:47:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Also, about that "losing an arm threat"</span><br />
[06:47:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I've lost three.</span><br />
[06:47:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And have gotten them back using a combination of Science and God Tier revivals.</span><br />
[06:48:14] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: I know.</span><br />
[06:48:35] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: Imagine losing it for eternity. Or...until this game perma-kills you. Whichever comes first.</span><br />
[06:48:39] <span style="color:#00027c">SR: That'd /suck./</span><br />
[06:48:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[06:49:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Its not like I can't handle being in a computer without a body.</span><br />
[06:49:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Bye.</span><br />
