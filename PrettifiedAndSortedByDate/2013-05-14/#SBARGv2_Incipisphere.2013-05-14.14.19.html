<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: i was just goin' through some old shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: and i happened on FI's blog</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: saw that rocketscythe he was so gung-ho about</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: jfc</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: this kid</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: /thid kid/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: */this kid/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: im honestly surprised</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they don't call him the chump for nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: that he isn't dead yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: that weapon looks so impractically i'm literally wondering how he could have wielded it without disembowling himself ahahahahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: or bet yet that he apparently managed to use it for /flight/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: /how/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: is he actually some sort of savant</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: are /we/ the chumps?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe he threw it at things</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: is he just</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: on such a higher level then us</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: that we can't comprehend?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I honestly don't even get his trip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: good lord Kat'd get on my case if she saw me ribbin' on him but i just can't help it</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ahahahaha oh man</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: The Kid was asking for it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Why do you think nobody has mentioned to the First Guardian about our awesome vans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: *?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ha</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I just don't understand why he doesn't make something else that can fly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: especially when there's an entire chunk of captcha codes (the PCH***** and psh***** blocks) decided to flying shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I know... I created a rocket drill hammer with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: But anywho.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: How goes things with ya two?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Mostly just sittin' around starin' at this tarot deck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: or three.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Sooner or late gonna have to distribute it, and get to that city...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...tarot desk&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I'm just messing around on LOSAC, seeing what kind of weird shit I can do</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: since I've done all the personal-quest stuff that's been unlocked so far, I'm doing self-imposed challenges in dungeons now, like trying to complete one using only a certain brush technique or keytool command</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I think My Dezien is getting bored/serious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Been sending monsters of the week after me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: well, it's not your fault - or theirs - that you can't get to them yet. Kamigami still has four more Gates to repair.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...kamigami?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: "hair god", issun.jar's term for the guardian</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ever since I had to use his pesterchum config after a consort broke my normal settings, his nicknames have been catching on with me</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: (which is why I'm using this alternate color today)</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: also, a meteor fell to my land today. it had a veil lab on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Seriously?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: yeah. either a horrorterror's playing pong, or a bug randomly set a meteor into Reckoning Mode and it just happened to hit my land</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: My advice?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Hah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Bar it off from the rest and leave it be, at least for the moment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Dunno when or even if ectobiology's a thing, hopefully not because I remember coming outta my mom</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: they got pictures and everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: and it would suck to find out i'm an ectobaby</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">FUTURE creeperPuncher [FCP]</span> 1:34 HOURS FROM NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">FCP: just completing a stable loop here... when you go to the meteor to check it out, have your keytool in Mend Tears mode before going inside. there's some serious spatial errors in there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: yikes</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...Or you could go explore it</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Spacial errors be damned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Yare yare daze...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might want to borrow my ring</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's supposed to ward off glitches or something lie that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *like</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure how much it can handle though</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Just don't poke any glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: yeah, good idea. what's the captcha code for it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: doesn't have one. It's a unique item.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Here's a  'bug' patcha  made a while back, whem MG was a glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: darn... I was hoping I could add it as a custom command to my keytool (it takes captcha codes and can then transform into the item)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: 7aTch63N</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  adds it and feels a +5 increase to Deflect Game Bugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: IT only works on general 'bugs', however.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Good luck, lass.</span><br />
