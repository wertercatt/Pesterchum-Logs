As Alex's arms come down, WE steps forward and opens both his fists, suddenly bringing his arms over to catch PW's wrists. Since PW so conveniently put his arms in teh perfect postition for an elbow bar throw, Judge follows through and uses the fulcrum of his locked arms to twist PW off his feet and throw him to the ground.

arms, he moves them away from him slightly and tries to bring his foot down in a curb stomp on PW's face.<br />

Thus since PW had to roll to do the kick, his aim would have had to be high, sicne that is how the human body works. You can't just fold yourself in two. Knowing this, Judge dives down towards PW, still holding onto his arms. Judge forces PW's right arm over his chest at an angle that would injure it and bend's the left arm --</span><br />
slightly back as he falls forward under the kick. At the end of his fall, Judge drives his elbow that was holding PW's left arm down towards Pw's neck, hoping to cruch his throat and us his weight to pin PW and choke him out.<br />
