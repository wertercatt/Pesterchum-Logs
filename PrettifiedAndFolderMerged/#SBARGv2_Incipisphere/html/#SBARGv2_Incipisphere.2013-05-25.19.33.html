<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I probably shouldn't have been able to do that, should I've.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: do what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Will a message from the future into existance, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Inducing a bootstrap paradox is something I figure you'd need to be a Time player to do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or figure now. Maybe the reason I could do it was I didn't know I shouldn't've been able to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: well, Karkat bootstrapped a hell of a lot of things in his memos, and he's a Blood player...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: and Sollux (Doom) was the one who created the transtimeline-memo feature to begin with</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I should've died. Barring anything, I would've. But I didn't because of a message I was only able to send back to myself because it saved my life and the more I think about it the more I unwrap my mind around it a little more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: well, I did make that stable-loop-theory post a few days ago, specifically talking about warnings-from-the-future with no apparent cause... which sounds like what happened to you <a href='http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51178224362/stable-time-loop-theory-a-light-players-perspective'>http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51178224362/stable-time-loop-theory-a-light-players-perspective</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Question:</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What is a bootstrap</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, in HS, "[S] Dirk: Save Everyone" is actually a bootstrap paradox too, albeit actional instead of informational</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Bootstrap paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Essetially something causing itself chronologically</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: NV: "pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps", basically a stable loop with no actual "origin"</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What's the difference between that and a temporal causality loop</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: In Blazblue Ragna's sword and his whole Bloodedge identity are a bootstrap paradox</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ragna takes up the sword, Blood-Scythe, and the surname Bloodedge, as homage to an unknown hero who helped his mentor out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But he was the unknown hero or whatever the hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: another example, in futurama: Fry is his own grandfather (technically a subtrope, but related concept)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Except at a point in the story he ends up getting sent back in time, developing amnesia. So yeah he's that hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He inspires himself, who then goes back in time to inspire himself and so on. His sword's like the best example of that: 'Cause of that timey-wimey craziness, it has no origin</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay I'm almost 100% sure that's a temporal causality loop and everything makes sense then</span><br />

<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: What's going on?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: SP seems to have developed cracks that glow yellow in his face</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nico was messin' with him and telling him he's got some disease from Gears of War but yeah, like he said more likely 'n not its something to do with his aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What virus were you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like referring to the glitch as a virus because it makes more sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: ThougH ThaT DoeS MakE a BiT MorE SensE. FirsT GlowinG EyeS, NoW CrackS AlonG MY FacE</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: You don't think it will progress will you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: HarD TO SaY, ThE FalsE VisionS Aren'T GivinG ME AnythinG RelatinG TO ThE TopiC AT HanD</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Well you can stop looking to the clouds for anwsers and some investigation yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yeah, don't bother with the clouds. a few weeks ago, I had Code Observer set up a recording system pointed at Skaia to see if there's a pattern, but it's nothing but blue noise...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean, it doesn't even say "gotcha" or anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: I've stopped listening to the Horror terrors for my own good</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: there's some random partial images from time to time, but not really anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: and then there was that one day Skaia's cloud generator seemed to be pulling from The Foundation's entire database of visual memetics... oh frogs that was bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: dreamselves seem to be mostly immune to memetic hazards fortunately, as are carapaces (their brains don't work the same as humans, and dream logic prevents the meme from taking hold)</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Like how the Horrorterrors have even said positive things</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: are you saying they are taking information from just about everywere?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Well are you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: sorry, was afk (freaking imps)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: idk for sure... but I think the import statement for both sources was changed to "import everything all;"</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Don't think I've worken up my dreamself yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: HAH</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Which is weird because I'm a Heart player shouldn't I be all over that shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: But..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...But I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you are your dream self</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's also possible for your dreamself to be "awake" but without you realizing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: before entry, for the longest time I figured this was the case for me... my dreamself was sleepwalking and staring at the clouds, and I'd subconsiously remember the visions but pass it off as deja vu</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((which, by the way, is my actual IRL headcanon for deja vu))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I feel so Ï„ired...</span><br />
