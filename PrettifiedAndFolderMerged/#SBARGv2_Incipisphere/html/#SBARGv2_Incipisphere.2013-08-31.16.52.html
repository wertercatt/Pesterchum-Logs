[08:00:23] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: were blackmailing the lock</span><br />
[08:00:29] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Instead of getting the stupid key, they are messing with the lock- wha</span><br />
[08:00:34] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: how's that going</span><br />
[08:00:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
[08:00:42] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: How do you blackmail a lock?</span><br />
[08:00:43] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what are you what to the lock???</span><br />
[08:00:47] <span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ...yeah okay.</span><br />
[08:00:48] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: ...</span><br />
[08:00:52] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: huh</span><br />
[08:00:54] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's.</span><br />
[08:00:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: an odd way of doing it.</span><br />
[08:00:59] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: um</span><br />
[08:01:05] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: did they get it to open?</span><br />
[08:01:11] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: NOPE</span><br />
[08:01:15] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: despite all suggestions pointing to their inabi- nevermind</span><br />
[08:01:17] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay</span><br />
[08:01:27] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i could do the timey thing and join you guys if you wanted</span><br />
[08:01:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you know</span><br />
[08:01:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and do smart stuff</span><br />
[08:01:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CVS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[08:02:01] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Oh sure, he gets to do the Timey thing, while my new job is to make sure everyone plays nice.</span><br />
[08:02:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why's that?</span><br />
[08:02:46] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: My new title is Slyph of Blood. From what we've gathered its my duty to heal relationships.</span><br />
[08:02:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and with relationships.</span><br />
[08:02:58] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and bonds.</span><br />
[08:03:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and shit like that.</span><br />
[08:03:07] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: welcome to being a Blood player cocksucker.</span><br />
[08:03:43] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'd be okay with it if it was more literal. Like, pull of some avatar moves and bloodbend people.</span><br />
[08:03:52] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: But as it is, its sort of a pain.</span><br />
[08:04:05] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cry more</span><br />
[08:04:10] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i was a Blood player the entire time</span><br />
[08:04:15] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: i though blood was avatar shit too</span><br />
[08:04:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you'd be quite wrong.</span><br />
[08:04:30] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: i was disapointed</span><br />
[08:04:32] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sure it's represented by blood.</span><br />
[08:04:32] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: So what are you now, then, angre lime text guy?</span><br />
[08:04:37] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: i like time better</span><br />
[08:04:45] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: time</span><br />
[08:04:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and i always felt this was more of an olive.</span><br />
[08:05:06] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Lime, olive, same difference.</span><br />
[08:05:06] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but that could be a result of strifekind for pChum</span><br />
[08:05:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, DS, I don't like how you handle that aspect at all.</span><br />
[08:05:17] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: poorly?</span><br />
[08:05:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause everyone sucks dicks at time travel and stability</span><br />
[08:05:28] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: I was gonna say- yeha</span><br />
[08:05:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe it's just because I'm kind of a snob in that respect</span><br />
[08:05:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or</span><br />
[08:05:39] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Except for you, I'm sure, SE.</span><br />
[08:05:39] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or</span><br />
[08:05:39] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: OR</span><br />
[08:05:43] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well yeah.</span><br />
[08:05:47] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: hm</span><br />
[08:05:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i've set up plenty of stable shit</span><br />
[08:06:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: aka nothing</span><br />
[08:06:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause i need SJ to give me the low down on how this fucking shit works</span><br />
[08:06:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: future me is doing rather fine though</span><br />
[08:06:42] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I can't wait until you have to deal with a Doomed counterpart. That should be interesting to watch.</span><br />
[08:06:57] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you mean a corpse?</span><br />
[08:06:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've dealt with that one before. it sucked.</span><br />
[08:07:19] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and that would require me to ever fuck shit up and have to die as a result</span><br />
[08:07:24] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: 's not always a corpse.</span><br />
[08:07:47] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Oh and I'm /sure/ you'd never do that, huh, Mr. Perfect?</span><br />
[08:07:53] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: you mean time dialation?</span><br />
[08:07:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nah</span><br />
[08:07:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: remember shinjiggly? the doomed version of me who had to prevent a frog from energydrinksploding?</span><br />
[08:08:06] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: SJ?</span><br />
[08:08:17] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i'm doubtful that it'd be as awful as you make it seem to be</span><br />
[08:08:37] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: SJ do you want to take that one, or should I?</span><br />
[08:08:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you can have a turn to talk</span><br />
[08:09:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a key to look for in a room full of pointy things</span><br />
[08:09:27] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what are the pointy things made of?</span><br />
[08:09:45] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Metal, as far as I can tell.</span><br />
[08:09:53] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno. They're pretty sharp though</span><br />
[08:09:59] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: If someone is gonna pull out a magnet...</span><br />
[08:10:02] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: magnetize it all or something like that</span><br />
[08:10:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: maybe the key will stick to it</span><br />
[08:10:21] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Hopefully</span><br />
[08:10:24] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: that, or</span><br />
[08:10:40] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: an entire pile of sharp blades will be heading their way</span><br />
[08:10:48] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Hey SJ, how good do you think they'd be in alchemization?</span><br />
[08:10:58] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i don't think anyone has a magnet that strong</span><br />
[08:11:11] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: 'youd be surprised</span><br />
[08:11:13] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: also</span><br />
[08:11:27] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: If they're any good, I wouldn't mind getting the code from you so I can use it on my pitchfork.</span><br />
[08:11:41] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: If they didnt, how would a magnet that would pull the key out from under all that work?</span><br />
[08:12:01] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: What if the key isn't magnetic, but the needles are?</span><br />
[08:12:17] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: You'd only get needles.</span><br />
[08:12:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: set up the magnet away from you and then turn it on</span><br />
[08:12:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: knowing our luck, probably.</span><br />
[08:12:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: again. i just said to magnitize the needles</span><br />
[08:12:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not pull out a huge fucking electro magnet</span><br />
[08:12:50] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: Wait</span><br />
[08:12:55] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm</span><br />
[08:13:06] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: That could be a possbility</span><br />
[08:13:11] <span style="color:#ff1717">CDS: THATS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING</span><br />
[08:13:16] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sure.</span><br />
[08:13:21] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Okay, but if the key is tangled in the needles, moving them wouldn't do any good. Move the needles and the key just goes with them.</span><br />
[08:13:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: whatever you say buddy.</span><br />
[08:14:44] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Okay, so its pretty clear that my first act as Sylph of Babysitting is to make sure Mr. Snarkypants over here plays nice.</span><br />
[08:14:58] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: good luck with that</span><br />
[08:15:18] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I'll leave luck to SJ. She needs it more than me.</span><br />
[08:16:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, what's going on?</span><br />
[08:16:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh</span><br />
[08:16:10] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: SJ should have most of the luck now, considering</span><br />
[08:16:21] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wow</span><br />
[08:16:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, luck can go either way</span><br />
[08:16:32] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: true</span><br />
[08:16:42] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: only if you fuck it up</span><br />
[08:16:48] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: like how "luck" can mean either bad or good luck</span><br />
[08:16:55] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: light players make huge gambles</span><br />
[08:17:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's the set up that pays off</span><br />
[08:17:08] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: mhm</span><br />
[08:17:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if they didn't set up or miscalculated they're boned</span><br />
[08:17:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like how Vriska miscalculated Terezi's abilities</span><br />
[08:17:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: got her skewered</span><br />
[08:17:52] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I doubt SJ plans on killing any of us anytime soon.</span><br />
[08:18:01] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not the point cockbite</span><br />

[08:18:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: pay more attention to what's being said and i will keep some insults to a mininum</span><br />
[08:18:39] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: I didn't think that was possible for you.</span><br />
[08:18:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no, she got own'd because she wanted to go after the current bad guy like a complete idiot, which would have screwed up an important timeloop.</span><br />
[08:18:46] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
[08:18:57] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and she didn't account for Terezi knowing this and being able to act on it</span><br />
[08:19:04] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: One day I will tell madamn web that you think that she is cute, and wants to date her, if you don't stop being a jack ass.</span><br />
[08:19:07] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it was a miscalculation</span><br />
[08:19:27] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who in the razing dicks is madam web</span><br />
[08:19:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wat</span><br />
[08:20:04] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: My Wizard consort- a car sized spider.</span><br />

[08:20:31] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they played with their cards up</span><br />
[08:20:46] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: vriska was gambling on terezi not being able to go through with it</span><br />
[08:20:47] <span style="color:#955311">CSB: dont dont most spiders just eat-... okay</span><br />
[08:20:48] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why would you risk getting your fancy consort friend killed?</span><br />

[08:21:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you sure it wasn't a t-rex</span><br />
[08:21:47] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I only have science raptor prototypes, SE.</span><br />
[08:21:55] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: just checking</span><br />
[08:21:55] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: No, but to kill an innocent game constuct is a bit much, don't you think?</span><br />
[08:22:02] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
[08:22:14] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CFF: One day I will tell madamn web that you think that she is cute, and wants to date her, if you don't stop being a jack ass.</span><br />

[08:41:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the reason is pretty obvious actually</span><br />
[08:41:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i /kinda/ hate how fucking stupid you all are</span><br />
[08:41:51] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: And here I was thinking it was your ego.</span><br />

[08:42:32] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: But at least I'm not rude about it.</span><br />
[08:42:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's nice to say that sure.</span><br />
[08:43:01] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but when i look around. i see a lot of idiots.</span><br />

[08:43:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ah yes.</span><br />
[08:43:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: because a hall of mirrors would have such a physically varried group</span><br />

[08:44:49] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i didn't think i would have too. it's pretty obvious when a person refers to a group that they wouldn't look the same</span><br />

[08:45:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The only thing this place has in common with a hall of mirrors is a stark limitation to two dimensions.</span><br />

[08:45:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Dude what is WITH you and trying to turn everything into some kind of dig against SE?</span><br />
[08:45:46] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: actually i tend to think of myself as a third dimensional character</span><br />
[08:45:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cause his personality grates with mine?</span><br />
[08:46:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it's probably got to do with him not liking people who don't care about most others</span><br />
[08:46:28] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: Or because you're a huge fucking asshole who doesn't know when to keep his rude comments to yourself?</span><br />

[08:46:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you've been fairly rude yourself for the pass while</span><br />
[08:46:57] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would it be characteristicly idiotic for me to mention that perhaps maybe putting down other players isn't going to help anyone, no matter who's going around slinging burns?</span><br />

[08:47:11] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i would like to say yes</span><br />

[08:50:01] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i don't like them. i don't care. we all know that i know i can be an ass and i have an ego</span><br />
[08:50:05] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not like that's any news</span><br />
[08:50:24] <span style="color:#228b22">CNC: So why are you even attempting to work with us if you hate us all so much?</span><br />
[08:50:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the only difference in you and me right now NC is that when you're sitting here being an ass to me is that you feel like you're somehow right</span><br />
