The entire place seems to be saying "/get out, you are not wanted here/". Also, you have lost connection with the outside world. Whatever chat device you used no longer seems to have any signal whatsoever.<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  shivers a bit from the creepy atmosphere --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#270041">[CFS]</span>  is silent, remembering this scenery all too well --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
The sneeze echoes. Oh, does it ever echo, the walls picking up the sound and bouncing it around and intensifying it to higher and higher pitches before finally letting it fade away.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#000000">[CCA]</span>  smiles and uncaptchloges his wand-sword --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  stood there for a second before he laughed idly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  boggles vacantly at the scenery he's never seen before --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: suddenly echoes</span><br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: (it may be best to keep things at a whisper around here)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (...pfft)</span><br />

<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *flicks on a flashlight, putting a finger to her lips, whispering quietly* (Stay quiet down here! I'm taking us to the entrance to Helheim; I've been down and mapped this place already.)</span><br />

<span style="color:#270041">CFS: (excellent)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: (thank you, thank you. i'll be here all night.)</span><br />
Assuming SE spoke in at a normal volume, the sound grew louder and louder in a similar fashion, actually /painful/ to listen to by the time it dies away.<br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: (no more getting lost then)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  equips her hydr0l1c lego leg in place of her rocketboot5 --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  idly shuffled through his packs until he pulled out a Ranger helmet and threw it on. The eyes glew a menacing red as the low light vision activated and he walked over to AG. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *nods, the walls gleaming slickly in her flashlight's beam as she leaps back onto her board and leads them through the maze of black walls*</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues following, on autopilot because brblunch --</span><br />
It's turn after turn after turn, twisting paths one after another, anything louder than the merest of whispers (including footsteps) echoing around so they sound like they're coming in distorted waves from all around you. Nothing looks particularly out of place, until...<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#000000">[CCA]</span>  sticks his hands hin his pockets as he quietly floats after everyone --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  hugs herself a bit --</span><br />
AG stops in front of an elaborate archway that looks quite out of place in this maze, if only for the silver detailing that runs up it in feathery swirls, some looking almost snakelike, others like wings, others simply random swirls or jagged lines. Everything about it practically /screams/ "foreboding". <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4KcFG4LpcA'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4KcFG4LpcA</a><br />
You get the sense that if you wanted to turn back… you would have to do so now.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  mentally notes that flying where walking does just fine is for ponces. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- ??? melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[?MP]</span>  floats on her rocketboots just slightly off the ground, and looks at the archway --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...The rubicon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The marked it clearly, at least</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uncaptchas a pillow and covers her ears with it, trying in vain to block out the noises --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (sorry, sorry)</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: (Everyone ready for this? I don't… really know what's inside.)</span><br />

Again, words spoken at a normal volume are nearly painful in their distortions by the time they die away. Good job.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (c'mon)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#270041">[CFS]</span>  winces before nodding as well --</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: … *fishes an obsidian key out of seemingly nowhere and sets it into a small indentation in the wall under the arch-- the wall simply melts away to allow them entry*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *heads on in*</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: -heads in-</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  cautiously pulls out his Hot! and Sticky! plasma rifle, giving off a light blue glow, as he walked through the gate. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  quickly follows through the door, treading cautiously --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#000000">[CCA]</span>  follows --</span><br />
The room is a circular chamber made of that same gleaming black obsidian. Ten doors are spaced out evenly over the walls, each visible only as an indent in the obsidian.<br />
The echoing effect appears to be gone here.<br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *draws a deep breath before turning to face the others, gesturing at the doors*</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((back just in time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: this is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: It's… the land of the dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Not the land of the living.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: … The way to get into Helheim is to die. If you go through these doors, I don't know what'll happen… but it won't be pretty. If you can't handle that… *shrugs* You could always try your luck fighting Modgud. *smiles weakly* Personally, I'd rather take my door…</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... Modgud?</span><br />

<span style="color:#270041">CFS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: A giantess tasked with sealing this place off from unwanted intruders, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Hel would not give us an insurmountable challenge, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  swallows hard at that, starting to quiver a bit, eyes darting around as she tries to figure out her choice --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞ Well at least going through the door will prepare me for my Denizen's realm Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... Yeeeah, I think... I'll just take the door... *shuffles towards what he expects to be his*</span><br />
Nothing that happens behind these doors will affect anything out of Hel's realm. If you are triggered by the thought of death in fun and unusual ways, the narration humbly suggests you take the boss battle instead.<br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: ...aye...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you think going through these doors will physically kill us? or mentally?</span><br />

<span style="color:#447463">CAG: I really don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  nodded as he looked each one over. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: But… I don't think it'll be /permanent/, whichever it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks woriedly at the doors, trying to figure out which one would be hers --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'd hope not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: we'd best not wear ourselves out so early on, regarless...</span><br />
The doors look all the same.<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i intend to kill my denizen before i go to tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: *regardless</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: I intend to face Hel as well. She wouldn't just kill me like this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Anyone who wants to fight Modgud… she's over that way, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: still. i like the prospect of fighting her.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who'd be up for that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: -smiles as she stands in front of a door-</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, you're sure the "death" only affects in here? don't want to randomly tier on this trip...</span><br />
There's an archway that definitely isn't a door with a black chain across it.<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#270041">[CFS]</span>  begins walking to a door --</span><br />

<span style="color:#270041">CFS: it is also far too early to be wearing ourselves out with a monumental confrontation such as that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: either way you're taking a chance. </span><br />
<span style="color:#270041">CFS: we'd still very likely need to progress further</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  walks over to one of the unclaimed doors --</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: I'll let all of you decide on your own, though. *and with that, she heads over to a random door and presses her hand up against it, the door changing from black obsidian to the colour of her text and sliding open to let her through-- she disappears, not looking back*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and if it glitches out and makes the finctional death real, my consorts are under orders to hightail my dreamself to the quest bed at the first sign of possible-dreamdeath so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i guess i'll just have to see how strong you all are metally.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#270041">[CFS]</span>  looks back to his door and puts his hand to it --</span><br />
Three more doors light up with their respective Players' text colours and slide open.<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#a80000">[CFA]</span>  sets her hand against the door, watching it change Red as she walks inside --</span><br />
