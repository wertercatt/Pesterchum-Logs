<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Have you ever taken a flight around the outer rim of the planets in the session? just looking to the stars?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Or spend a night playing games with the people on the moons?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Maybe even sparring on Skaia's battle field?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: You can still find a rush of emotion, different as they may be.</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: And as it may surprise you, the one that comforted me was Ash...</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: No, it doEsn't. Not in thE slightEst. ShE just hAs to bE An AngEl to EvErybody /but mE/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I have a very messy streak in this session. Everything to me seemed to never be going the right way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I don't know the entire history behind what happened between the two of you beside what you told me, but Ash seems to do well with people she doesnt know. Maybe you've known her longer than the rest of us. Maybe she acted differently because she thought maybe you would be able to handle things, or maybe she was just making too many mistakes for herself to handle and made things worse between you two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: For the record, if it at least doesn't kill you. It would be good for the two of you to settle things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Because it doesnt sound very settled to me.</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Well, if she doesn't want to talk now... then lets leave it alone for now. But if it is still causing you to go off the deep end, get her or get somebody out there to ask what is so wrong about her talking to you is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: To me it just looks like she is too scared to talk about what happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: If she refuses to talk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: That or she thinks there is nothing to talk about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Which would be pretty rude of her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: You just need to ask the right questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: The right questions lead to better questions, which give you answers.</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: There are plenty of people who have thought the same way. But there are those who had enough courage and morality to never do it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: You are a brave person. The only reason you use your current method is because you dont want to think about it. You chose your brain as a target because you are afraid of your own thoughts, right?</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: But later on, I found that I think even more with music, but in a more productive way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: When I work of stuff, I like to have music playing because it makes me think easier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: When thoughts flow like music, things are easier to put together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Think of your experience with Ash as a bad note in a melody.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: How do you get rid of a bad note? You change the song to make the note work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Or get rid of the bad note and write your own song.</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Maybe she doesnt want to talk to you because she knows that youve hated her for what she has done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Maybe she hates herself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  He goes silent for a few moments, looking down at the blood-stained carpet, listening to her. Her final words made him snap back into reality, however. "No. She doesn't hate herself. I know she doesn't. Because the night I finally told her I'd had enough, was the same night she and FS got engaged. She never responded to my message." He laid back and looked off to the side. "Besides, she deserves to be happy, even if I --</span><br />
hate her. I don't trust my own judgement to be correct."<br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...Do you want her to be happy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  nods slowly, closing his eyes. "I've thought about killing her, but that doesn't change the fact that outside of my head, in the real world where everything doesn't revolve around me, I'm sure she deserves it." --</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: However patience tends to play a large factor in these kinds of things...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I've run 19 long years of patience...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: But action is also a part of something like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: My problem was never taking action in the things I needed to be...</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  hugs her back "See, people like you /do/ deserve happiness. You're twice the person anyone else here is. But I don't deserve it, I'm a fucking asshole. You're stood here trying your hardest to make me feel better, which I thank you for by the way, but I haven't even shed a single tear. And believe me, I want to. Your speeches tonight have been very moving. I just, I want happiness but I don't think I deserve it. After the --</span><br />
shit I've done, how could I?"<br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Because people change...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: To bring him up again, in Chronos' final moments, he didnt even regret a single bad thing he did... he was happy it seemed... he brought no regrets with him to his grave...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: He was insane, maybe... but im sure he changed... in some way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: To be honest it was his doing that all this glitchy stuff happened. Which what caused me to change and subsequently create a power that could defeat him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: In some deranged way, he helped me become who i am.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: He helped me change.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  nods, understanding once more. "Definitely." He looked back down at the ground, keeping her held close to him. He was starting to believe that maybe, just fucking maybe, he deserved happiness. "If I ask you a question, will you promise to take it completely seriously, and understand that I am asking not for any personal gain of my own, but maybe to help you realize something you've made me realize." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "You said that you've been looking for happiness too. And that you and I share the same dream, which is to be in love. Now, when surrounded by all these people who are completely fine in every way, and outside of /my/ head, sane and loving. How the hell have you managed to remain alone, without someone by your side and such?" he asked. "Unless of course you do have someone, in which case I apologize for assuming otherwise." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  smiled lightly. "I can't entirely answer that myself. It just never happened is all. Sure I've had a few good friends in the past but... you know, nothing ever really got serious with anyone. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: There was this one girl online whom I used to hang out with but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: you know. Long distances and what hell ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Some things are hard to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I've basically lived on Patience.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  nods. "I know what you mean. It's not for everybody. I have to ask though, in a perfect world where the stars aligned right and everything was as it should be, where a sixteen year old boy isn't able to blow his brains out six times a day and a nineteen year old girl isn't forced to live a life thinking she's done wrong, and she's 'null', would you consider a relationship with that sixteen year old boy that blows his --</span><br />
brains out. I have no doubt that you, in your kindness and right ways would give him reason to do so." He decided to stop there. He could have easily sugar coated it all he wanted, but the question was obvious, and boy, he knew that.<br />
