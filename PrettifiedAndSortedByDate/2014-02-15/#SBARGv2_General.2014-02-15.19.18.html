[07:21:39] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: i am honestly curious how the non-character FL acts. &gt;&gt;</span><br />

[07:27:13] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: the rant  that is</span><br />
[07:27:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well technically Dolos was an imposter denizen, but it was also DT and not FL in that case</span><br />
[07:27:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, since DT got basically soul merged back into FL, that point is moot.</span><br />
[07:28:17] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: not gunna ask</span><br />
[07:28:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL /really/ didn't know any of the shit he was messing with that was alchemized.</span><br />
[07:28:45] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: &gt;&gt;</span><br />
[07:29:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like "oh I need a program to make an AI from a brain scan, better use some captcharoids and alchemy to make some software on a disc that has it."</span><br />

[07:31:24] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: ...probably v.v;</span><br />
[07:31:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: SJ didn't really do very much creative alchemization and got most of her cool items from dungeon crawling. ➜</span><br />

[07:33:03] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: and ic AS isn't much different from myself either- aside from her greater ease in ability to offer to lend her ear to someone...and the trauma she went through today</span><br />

[07:33:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though I still wonder how exactly a dungeon on another person's land would generate a prostheticleg as loot though.  ➜</span><br />
[07:33:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CP's alchemy binges boiled down to "let's throw things at the punch designix and see what comes out"...</span><br />
[07:33:59] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: XD</span><br />
[07:34:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like for the leg of time, I was going to have it explained through time shenanigans ➜</span><br />
[07:34:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and SJ, I thought the agreed headcanon was that all dungeons adapted to the players, both challenge- and loot-wise?</span><br />
[07:34:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that dungeon was rife with timeloops all over the place. ➜</span><br />
[07:34:59] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Watching the god of Pokemon dance for no reason is hilarious for some reason</span><br />
[07:35:13] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: ...because it's  a god?</span><br />
[07:35:17] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: :P</span><br />
[07:35:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it was "accepted", but it couldn't exactly be denied because there weren't enough GM's that wanted to say no about it. ➜</span><br />
[07:35:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: as well as the fact that they were still in hiding. ➜</span><br />
[07:36:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not to mention the fact that I'm still a horrible complete doormat. ➜</span><br />
[07:36:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  pats SJ sympathetically --</span><br />
[07:38:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I sorta wonder how v2 would have gone if all the puzzles were solved instantly...</span><br />
[07:38:45] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: we would all be more bored than we are now &gt;&gt;</span><br />
[07:38:53] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing by that you mean the players solved them faster? ➜</span><br />
[07:38:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[07:39:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually, a better question is how it would have gone if SV wasn't a GM.</span><br />
[07:40:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, for one thing, RS probably wouldn't have become canon chronos. ➜</span><br />
[07:40:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Ash likely wouldn't have become an op</span><br />
[07:40:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean GM</span><br />
[07:40:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since didn't SV get Ash in as a GM?</span><br />
[07:41:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: technically yeah. ➜</span><br />
[07:41:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (as my replacement for flash animation...) ➜</span><br />
[07:41:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (&gt;_&gt;) ➜</span><br />
[07:42:05] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, Seth probably would have a way different story in terms of the part where he started killing players. ➜</span><br />
[07:43:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL would have ended up getting killed by a prospitian traitor (that looked like MK) instead...</span><br />
[07:43:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, he probably wouldn'y have had a blog and he wouldn't be as impossible, but the assasinations would have still been a thing. ➜</span><br />
[07:43:12] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah ➜</span><br />
[07:43:23] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I was going to do something when Seth starting doing that, that I could make it make sense later</span><br />

[07:43:52] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: but he never went after me,</span><br />
[07:44:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL's denizen would have never evolved into Prometheus though.</span><br />
[07:44:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember we originally had the plan for Seth to kill the entirty of Team Spectrum, but because of SV's online schedule and general weirdness, it didn't exactly happen that way. ➜</span><br />
[07:45:00] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Aww</span><br />
[07:45:07] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: wait why?</span><br />
[07:45:19] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: exactly</span><br />
[07:45:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the schedule thing? ➜</span><br />
[07:45:24] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: why would you do that?</span><br />
[07:45:42] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: *wait, why Spectrum?</span><br />
[07:45:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because that was the team he was from/got kicked out of. ➜</span><br />
[07:46:19] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: But why kill /all/ of us</span><br />
[07:46:53] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this plan was made before there were 8 people on his team. ➜</span><br />
[07:47:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: of course, the team was kinda falling apart anyways, with the lack of actual meetings and such... ➜</span><br />
[07:47:54] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: yeah...</span><br />
[07:48:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think overall, "teams" didn't actually end up meaning that much over the course of the game.</span><br />
[07:48:31] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: agreed</span><br />
[07:48:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even Momentum only did a couple of actual team-like things, like that one training event (that Gambit totally IC-hijacked :P)</span><br />

[07:50:34] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have no idea. ➜</span><br />
[07:50:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've really been wondering about NN lately. ➜</span><br />
[07:51:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't think they've even been online at all today.</span><br />
[07:51:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: she was here for like a minute and said nothing ➜</span><br />
[07:51:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually wait, the cease-respondings you see are full handles and not just initials.</span><br />
[07:51:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I saw NN in the userlist ➜</span><br />
[07:51:50] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: i saw NN be on for a flash sec.</span><br />
[07:52:03] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: I see full handles, trust me it was NN</span><br />
[07:52:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: might be avoiding me, and not you Noodles.</span><br />
[07:52:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: could be avoiding any of us.</span><br />
[07:52:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the reason I thought it /wasn't/ them is because <a href='#Established_OOC'>#Established_OOC</a> had a "CNN ceased responding to memo" as well, so I thought it was Nova.</span><br />
[07:52:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or it could have to do with those "overheating problems" NN has been having with her computer lately. ➜</span><br />
[07:52:59] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: i missed something big didn't i? :I</span><br />

[07:53:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and SJ, could be.</span><br />
[07:54:19] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: o.o;</span><br />
[07:54:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: NN is the keyholder of the memos around here btw. ➜</span><br />
[07:55:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, the two main ones. ➜</span><br />
[07:55:25] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: key....holder?</span><br />
[07:55:50] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: "founder" means they're the main admin</span><br />

[07:56:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so basically, NN has a lot of power. ➜</span><br />
[07:56:51] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: ok yea...but NN was basicallyin a being in charge role for as long as I can remember</span><br />
[07:57:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though she almost never goes into the RP memos anymore, and even then it's usually strictly OOC business. ➜</span><br />
[07:58:09] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Did NN ever?</span><br />
[07:58:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which raises the question of why she has the key to that memo...</span><br />
[07:58:43] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: at the beginning NN used to RP, but got bored of it after a while. ➜</span><br />
[07:59:34] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Because no one questioned it and NN wasn't acting questionable before</span><br />
[07:59:38] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: man...it feels like the beginning to a sad, heroic tale</span><br />
[07:59:39] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: sorry</span><br />

[08:01:37] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: tehnically SJ and CB, but they're not in the actual memo for it. ➜</span><br />
[08:01:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what about SS</span><br />
[08:01:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, sorta</span><br />
