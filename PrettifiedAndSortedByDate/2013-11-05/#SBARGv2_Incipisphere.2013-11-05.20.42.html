<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT ChanServ [CCC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: reminds me of this random encounter dude from the other day who wanted me to go back to take out hitler. I declined. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SL, like I mentioned, a GT death can't be both Heroic /and/ Just. it's mutually exclusive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2d8a18">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: according to replay value</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: what are we even talking about</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#55aa00">CURRENT suddenlyEchoes [CSE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: more player deaths</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ffc080">CURRENT divineJoker [CDJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: According to /basic logic with a clock/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: why does I always come in during fuckawfull weird conversations</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: The hand can't be pointing at both ends at the same time, after all!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........DJ, you actually have a point. since the clocks are physical...!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((in other news i am parp trolling as the nba jam announcer))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unless skaianet upgraded them to support superpositions &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: CP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SE, hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Doesn't that only work if noone is watching?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the clock we knew of got destroyed by that crazy bastard slick</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but when Jade died</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: it still tocked</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Multiple Clocks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what's the notion of them being physical have to do with it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: For /every single player/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, what I meant was, the clock can't land on BOTH Heroic /and/ Just, is what I was saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how do you prove that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but it can favor one</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The clock's probably not physical, it's a metaphysical representation more then an actual object</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Scratch probably just had one since he's </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: special</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Which Spades Slick destroyed somehow</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'd say</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Ornis had one, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ornis is special too</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that you should just not make assumptions about shit we don't know all about</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I've been reading recaps, slowly but surely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: First Guardians that are able to have a conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we don't know enough about the clocks</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or guardians as is to really make any definite statements that could be "derived from logic"</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there's a lack of source material</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: anywho.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Clocks can be manipulated?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah. the clock will either, not choose one cause you've not made sufficient actions that led to your death to cause one to be chosen</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they can be</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Areanea did</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: as far as we can see, Light players can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: And so can Slick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: with a crowbar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i would go as far as to say, due to Void being a sort of weird thing like them too, could in addition</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Knocking the clock over.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Slick made physical contact with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a special juu jbreaker crowbar ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: So, it could likely have physical manipulation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *jujubreaker ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but i wouldn't say him hitting it is what caused it to choose just</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Like, what if someone say, grabbed the grandfather clock?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i 'unno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: then they becokme the person the clock is about</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: obviousl</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Forced it to make a certain choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I doubt that, kitty. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: then the clock turns into nic cage</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think the manipulation is... well. less than physical.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but at the same time, i can't say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: and the related player becomes auctually imortal</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...Who would have to gain from FL's death?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: CN would</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i really don't know what happened with FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i understand why DD stayed dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and that is all i understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing less.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Apparently died heroically after a suicidal attack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: even though CP mentioned that suicide /can't/ be heroic or just.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: what was FL doing it for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: suicide is meant</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: within the context of "bluh bluh, gonna kill myself."</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: Because if he was sacrificing himself to save some inocent, then its heroic</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ceca54">CURRENT fortuitousSleuth [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: it was n<span style="color:#730e8f">ot heroic</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kamikaze "the enemy dies with me," is heroic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: to defeat a boss that probably could have been defeated in a safer way ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what SJ said</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: do trust me w<span style="color:#730e8f">hen I say that</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /if/ it meant preserving players who are necessary for later events.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa4a4b">CPK: and apparently that does /not/ include FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if we were all about to die, Perfect Magnus charging a Laser of Kill Everything, and FL used Chaos Dunk... yeah, THAT I would completely understand being Heroic!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but the boss was already at less than half health, and all of us were still fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...I guess this leads back to the consorts...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Does anyone still remember that list?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that's like saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: "everything was going fine until FL killed the boss,"</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not saying it makes complete sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I know it had one of every aspect and class...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who knows what could have changed in those last moments.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "until he /overkilled/ the boss in a kamikaze attack". FTFY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ftfy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Fixed That For You.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: kay</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (is okay, took me a while to find that one out too)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: all i can say is. we don't know what /could/ have happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Plus, those consorts were using weaponry made by ProtoTech, which the company apparently went under recently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: unless one of you were a Seer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: After the /CEO vanished/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...should I count the electrons on the atom symbol?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: There are quite a few, maybe it might be a hint...</span><br />
