<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The introduction of elevators into the school. The principal decided that there should be two elevators: one that goes up, and one that goes down, and in order to prevent kids from playing around with them they should only be able to go in those directions. The result: the elevators are used only once, and then never again. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: If you don't get it, they keep going up and never stop :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and keep going down, and never stop :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: unreal air elevators ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And likewise, before the elevators, he wanted people going down to go down to walk towards their right and the ones going up the stairs to walk to the left :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He didn't understand why people kept bumping into each other :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I thought of a solution to that as a kid. have portals at the top and bottom of each shaft, and connect the elevator cables to themselves through the portal!</span><br />

When Allison expresses concern that inviting too many boys to her birthday party would make it become too "silly", Mrs. Jewls "mathematically" confirms her concern by writing, "boys+boys=silly" on the board. Then, for the sake of gender equ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">she also writes, "girls+girls=silly". :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dammit, my puzzle bone is being tickled...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in fact, I remember that specific problem. hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I liked how a lot of the stories had a lot of intelligence to them, but they were also so much mindscrew that it's easy to just pass it off as dumb and random :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: boys and girls?</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: In the second book, one of the characters has this when they wonder since there's no 19th floor, wouldn't her classroom really just be on the 29th floor? And for her Fridge Logic, she is rewarded with being stuck on the 19th floor :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok the first one: S is 1, Y is 2, L is 4, O is 7, B is... 6, and I is 3.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that works. 6721+6721=13442, it lines up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh wow :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And 6721 = BOYS :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: 13442 = SILLY :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Does that still equal SILLY? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the second one's a bit harder, since you don't have an extra letter at the front to make "1" automatically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but all the previous numbers need to still be there too</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so it needs to be G3R41=G3R41=13442</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: can you find valid values for g and r</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually SL, they /have/ to be separate, because L + L = L, and 4 + 4 != 4.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: how does it work? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: where does l + l = l come from</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm thinking either I or L has to be zero, but they can't /both/ be, that was one of the rules. two letters can't be the same digit.</span><br />
