[03:59:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: whats the relevance of him being here?</span><br />
[03:59:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FM, what timezone? it's 2pm here, so you're four hours west of me.</span><br />
[03:59:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FM, where are you at? Aren't you Florida? Shouldn't it be like 4 pm or something? :&gt;</span><br />
[03:59:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Or 3 pm :&gt;</span><br />
[03:59:37] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I dunno :&gt;</span><br />

[04:00:09] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ What is the tOpic at hand? ♫</span><br />

[04:00:21] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ and we'll find out /)</span><br />
[04:01:22] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: According to a source, he visited the Incipisphere memo and mentioned plots being retconned.</span><br />
[04:02:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Huh.  :&gt;</span><br />
[04:02:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2mqqCMu-LM'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2mqqCMu-LM</a> I am not sorry</span><br />

[04:02:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: He did mention something in the general chat :&gt;</span><br />
[04:02:21] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: About starting up a new arg :&gt;</span><br />
[04:02:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and being mad at the admins or something :&gt;</span><br />
[04:02:32] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ....wat /)</span><br />
[04:02:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:02:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tired of admin infighting.</span><br />
[04:02:55] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont even know  who the admins are so</span><br />
[04:02:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ^ I could see that</span><br />
[04:03:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont think i have anything to contribute to this</span><br />
[04:03:22] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, I guess there's admin infighting? I don't know. He just passively mentioned it. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:03:25] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: Well, I would like to say that there has been no admin infighting. The only issues between admins has been caused by the presence of SV and his conflicting opinions.</span><br />
[04:03:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh boy politics</span><br />
[04:03:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm... I'm not sure if /I/ should pastebin something.</span><br />
[04:03:57] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, thanks for posting that lol :&gt;</span><br />
[04:04:03] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Huh, SG. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:04:08] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't really know what to make of it. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:04:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As it might be best kept private.</span><br />
[04:04:20] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: We are also not retconning any existing plotlines, just changing them. SV was not a fan of the changes despite being overruled.</span><br />
[04:04:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then don't, FL.</span><br />
[04:04:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its kinda about this though.</span><br />
[04:04:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sooo</span><br />
[04:04:50] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, do what you gotta do. Maybe pm SG if it's private? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:04:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If it's best kept private or was told to you in confidence...</span><br />
[04:04:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no idea what to do</span><br />
[04:05:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: can you at least say who's involved in it? maybe send it to who needs to see it over pm? ➜</span><br />
[04:05:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *shrugs* If it betrays trust, how much d'you value someone's trust, I guess.</span><br />
[04:05:29] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: He has been impulsive with his decisions which has caused problems for the other GMs in the group, thus SV is no longer a GM.</span><br />
[04:05:43] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: SG, not taking sides here, not even sure what's going on, but isn't a retcon technically a change to an existing canon? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:05:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah i was thinking the same thing</span><br />
[04:06:03] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: A retcon is pretending it didn't happen entirely.</span><br />
[04:06:07] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean i dont care about retconning but</span><br />
[04:06:09] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I have known him to be impulsive. Still like the guy. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:06:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SG, do the plotlines you're not retconning involve things SV has simply done on his own without running them past a majority of the GMs?</span><br />
[04:06:27] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: Yes.</span><br />
[04:06:41] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:06:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh well then</span><br />
[04:06:48] Retroactive continuity (often shortened to retcon) refers to the deliberate alteration of previously established facts in a work of serial fiction.<br />
[04:07:02] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont have any problem so</span><br />
[04:07:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Huh, 'k.</span><br />
[04:07:14] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: We are still able to edit the plots without retconning them completely.</span><br />
[04:07:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i havent been involved in the major arcs anyway</span><br />
[04:08:06] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just wondering something else real quick. Did SV break a rule as well by revealing to the general that he was a gm? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:09:07] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: No. That was his choice.</span><br />
[04:09:12] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:09:25] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I suppose it would be a personal choice. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:09:36] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: The rest of the GMs have all decided to remain anonymous for the fun of the ARG.</span><br />
[04:09:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does this have anything to do with that one memo-log post that I was told to get rid of for some weird reason? ➜</span><br />
[04:10:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... the only recent SV-run "canon" event I can think of was two days ago on the meteor... which I can't remember what it was about since I joined late</span><br />
[04:11:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FS' plotline involving a trans-sessional void-connection uplink. Thing.</span><br />
[04:11:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which he was incredibly excited about.</span><br />
[04:11:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: off-topic: <a href='http://asstlevania.tumblr.com/post/60296641011/greatesteverseamonkey-so-im-on-a-seedy-website'>http://asstlevania.tumblr.com/post/60296641011/greatesteverseamonkey-so-im-on-a-seedy-website</a></span><br />
[04:11:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I just rejoined yesterday. Oh. Speaking of which, is dubiousSwain in the incip chat? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:11:55] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nope.</span><br />
[04:11:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah im not involved enough in admin politics to have any meaningful input</span><br />
[04:12:01] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Darn :'/ :&gt;</span><br />
[04:12:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: amy is though</span><br />
[04:12:16] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: FL.</span><br />
[04:12:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hmm?</span><br />
[04:12:39] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: SV took that out of context and I am sorry.</span><br />
[04:13:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its okay</span><br />
[04:13:17] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: When I said I didn't want the ARG to be all about the people on the memo, the context was that I wanted memo players and tumblr players to all be able to play together.</span><br />
[04:13:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda wish that more people could be involved again.</span><br />
[04:13:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I agree on that.</span><br />
[04:13:45] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Same, FL :&gt;</span><br />
[04:13:58] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's funny, because my character is all individualistic :&gt;</span><br />
[04:13:59] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: but :&gt;</span><br />
[04:14:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think teamwork will be key :&gt;</span><br />
[04:14:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: More like. Player-things, instead of just nothing and us getting bored with like nothing to do?</span><br />
[04:14:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Collaboration was the greatest part of the orignal SBARG.</span><br />
[04:14:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That'd be cool from an RP standpoint.</span><br />
[04:14:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and I would hate for that spirit to vanish.</span><br />
[04:14:46] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: Yes, and we're trying our hardest to think up ways to reignite that feeling of comradere.</span><br />
[04:15:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why I came up with the concept of Sburban Finale</span><br />
[04:15:21] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the other day SP thought it was "supposed to be about team spectrum", and I just felt horrible because not only is someone mising 99% of everything else, but they also think that a broken team is important. ➜</span><br />
[04:15:44] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I thought about that a couple months ago. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:15:50] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: No one team is important.</span><br />
[04:15:59] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: No one player is important than the other.</span><br />
[04:16:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But it also doesn't seem like it's really about /anyone/ except /Chronos/.</span><br />
[04:16:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except seth</span><br />
[04:16:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, I'm not even sure if TT is even going to ever show up in the memo. ➜</span><br />
[04:16:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He's off lurking in the background and we're like. "whee we are twiddling our thumbs".</span><br />
[04:16:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but hes the main villain, so...</span><br />
[04:16:33] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: while we wait for our boring villain to show up and do shit that he's not doing.</span><br />
[04:16:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well, SG, I'd say it's more like every team is important and every player is important. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:16:38] <span style="color:#000000">CSG: Indeed, he is the main villian.</span><br />

[04:36:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyone could use it... but it seems kinda OP.</span><br />
[04:36:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
[04:36:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then don't use it.</span><br />
[04:36:49] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: OP as in overpowered :&gt;</span><br />

[04:37:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I'm just wondering if it /actually is/</span><br />

[04:37:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If /you/ think it's OP, /probably/.</span><br />
[04:37:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh right, that thing.</span><br />
[04:38:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, are there any dungeons scheduled besides EQ on Friday and FF on Sunday(or-Tuesday)? that's all I see on the dungeonpad</span><br />
[04:39:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: idk I don't think so.</span><br />
[04:39:34] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't plan on doing any dungeons with my character. At least, not that I've thought up. My character isn't really much of the fighting type. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:39:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: He kind of prefers to stay at home, anyway :&gt;</span><br />
[04:40:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#887000">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:40:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: back</span><br />
[04:40:30] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: we still talking meta-character development?</span><br />
[04:40:38] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah :&gt;</span><br />
[04:40:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: next week I'll probably start writing Fahr Caverns Part 2. I... don't think I'm gonna do the Minecraft Buildy Thing this time around, it takes too long even with SinglePlayerCommands...</span><br />
[04:41:02] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: see one thing that i think is interesting about my development is that theres an ooc component to it</span><br />
[04:41:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It was cool though :)</span><br />
[04:41:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: see this is the first rp i ever really got into</span><br />
[04:41:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and i didnt know what a good character was supposed to be in an rp context</span><br />
[04:41:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so lets just say VeilMeteorTimeShenanigans is a /maybe/</span><br />
[04:41:45] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: okay :&gt;</span><br />
[04:41:45] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so i created a pretty 1-dimensional asshole</span><br />
[04:41:45] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CLL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[04:42:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but then i realized that a good character needed more than that</span><br />
[04:42:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So he grew</span><br />
[04:42:16] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: hence all the development sls gotten over the past week or so</span><br />
[04:42:21] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: My character was hugely obnoxious. And while he may or may not still be, at least I don't totally hate my own character. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:42:39] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah it was as much me learning to rp as sl learning not to be a terrible person</span><br />
[04:42:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah SL, this is my first major RP as well. but I learn pretty fast, so I got used to it fairly quickly :D</span><br />
[04:43:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I did SCODE.</span><br />
[04:43:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the AI discussion?</span><br />
[04:43:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: exactly</span><br />
[04:43:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I was in SCODE as well /)</span><br />
[04:43:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think that might have been FL's crowning moment of awesome.</span><br />
[04:43:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: that was sort of a microcosm of sls character development, at least from a meta-perspective</span><br />
[04:43:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yay SCODE buddies.</span><br />
[04:43:45] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I had an idea of what I wanted for Ash when i came in /)</span><br />
[04:43:53] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ but that was it, she took off on her own from there /)</span><br />
[04:43:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I didn't even mean to come in.</span><br />
[04:44:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I blame CA entirely.</span><br />
[04:44:03] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think my character remains just as annoying, but since he's playing a more passive role, it doesn't show through as much. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:44:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i created an ai character that didnt have a lot  of thought put in, but when discussing it i think i created a much more nuanced ai character</span><br />
[04:44:48] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: im surprised an ai going rogue and then realizing it was wrong to do so isnt a more common trope tbh</span><br />
[04:44:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: to be honest, I think I actually thought of CP's self-prototyping several weeks before it happened, the Battery Incident just gave me a perfect IC reason for it.</span><br />
[04:45:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but almost everything else of his plot I've made up on the fly :P</span><br />
[04:45:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL, you also made enemies.</span><br />
[04:45:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I plan absolutely nothing about my char-d because I don't give a fuck.</span><br />
[04:45:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think that works well for the character though</span><br />
[04:46:03] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: he knows that hes burned bridges</span><br />
[04:46:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: one of those bridges is a spaceship.</span><br />
[04:46:26] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: you have a spaceship as your enemy.</span><br />
[04:46:33] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: lol :&gt;</span><br />
[04:46:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: guys, tell me when its safe for me to discuss the next thing of FL's which /is/ OP.</span><br />
[04:46:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL, I'm /ignoring you/.</span><br />
[04:46:56] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I swear, this is the best discussion in the general chat we've had in a while :&gt;</span><br />
[04:47:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, discuss it any time :&gt;</span><br />
[04:47:13] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though apparently AG will ignore you :&gt;</span><br />
[04:47:15] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i know, ive sort of had a lot  of this brewing</span><br />
[04:47:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you were ignoring me you wouldn't state you are ignoring me as a responce.</span><br />
[04:47:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and im afraid there might still be some ooc resentment for my characters actions earlier on</span><br />
[04:47:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as that therefore means they you are /not/ ignoring me to say you are ignoring me.</span><br />
[04:47:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that*</span><br />
[04:48:03] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Maybe AG has a quirk so that every time you talk, AG says: FL I am ignoring you :&gt;</span><br />
[04:48:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … that's a good idea EP.</span><br />
[04:48:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But anyway, Focus Ribbon + Low Tier Regen Item.</span><br />
[04:48:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: then I wouldn't just have to note his initials.</span><br />
[04:48:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but then you start spamming</span><br />
[04:49:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And you don't /have/ quirks anyway</span><br />
[04:49:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you have the /me mo.</span><br />
[04:49:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, irc kind of doesn't have quirks :&gt;</span><br />
[04:49:24] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Unless you use a script :&gt;</span><br />
[04:49:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: AG, do you have scripts? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:49:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and scripts are /bad/</span><br />
[04:49:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can make one.</span><br />
[04:49:48] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: why are scripts bad? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:50:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because, well, look at it</span><br />
[04:50:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: any memo I am in and gambit is in, it will automatically spam that message if I say /anything/</span><br />
[04:50:50] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:51:10] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: surely AG wouldn't spam :&gt;</span><br />
[04:51:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it would be worse if we change Gambits name to my own</span><br />
[04:51:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As it would be replying to herself then</span><br />
[04:51:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[04:51:28] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: so I don't think gambit will actually create that script :&gt;</span><br />
[04:51:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: do what now?</span><br />
[04:51:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: this discussion was going so well</span><br />
[04:51:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THAT IS GENIUS</span><br />
[04:51:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh wait, scripts gone bad is what happened to naziofGrammar the other day isn't it?</span><br />
[04:52:02] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: hehe :&gt;</span><br />
[04:52:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and possibly break the channel</span><br />
[04:52:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: that kid sure liked his new world orders :&gt;</span><br />
[04:54:22] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: So what's another good idea for sbargv2 improvements? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:55:08] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Rain ♫</span><br />
[04:55:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: hehe :&gt;</span><br />
[04:55:20] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: what?</span><br />
[04:55:21] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ It sh6uld rain every Qnce in a while ♫</span><br />
[04:55:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, uh...</span><br />
[04:55:28] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm sure it has rained on somebody's land :&gt;</span><br />
[04:55:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: before :&gt;</span><br />
[04:55:34] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ It's raining here ♫</span><br />
[04:55:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL has several Focus ribbons, that burn away after one use.</span><br />
[04:55:49] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: What is it raining?</span><br />
[04:56:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: wouldn't it be funny if someone had fire powers and they were having a fight against someone or something and all of a sudden it started raining? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:56:10] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ HydrOgen, Oxygen, sOme nitr6gen ♫</span><br />
[04:56:14] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Idk what else ♫</span><br />
[04:56:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If FL would get killed by an attack that would bring him from 2 or more HP to zero, it will save him at 1.</span><br />
[04:56:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However he has a few of these... and a regen item.</span><br />
[04:56:36] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i feel like we need more session-wide villains imo</span><br />
[04:56:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the most teamworky ive been was when fi was involved</span><br />
[04:56:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://pastebin.com/wFfni8zT'>http://pastebin.com/wFfni8zT</a></span><br />
[04:57:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats the code for the regen item</span><br />
[04:57:04] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
[04:57:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: assuming you start from 1 hp.</span><br />
[04:57:14] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I kind of like that idea too, SL :&gt;</span><br />
[04:57:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it waits a number of frames, then adds 1 to his current HP unless he reaches his cap.</span><br />
[04:57:33] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FM, do you like dogestep? :&gt;</span><br />
[04:57:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of 2047.</span><br />
[04:57:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: As do I, SL/EP.</span><br />
[04:57:40] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ Idk what that is ♫</span><br />
[04:57:45] <span style="color:#133295">CEP:  <a href='http://25.media.tumblr.com/c3116ce6797f5196c39bd442fcd62e70/tumblr_msk2kscRBO1qi91wgo1_500.jpg'>http://25.media.tumblr.com/c3116ce6797f5196c39bd442fcd62e70/tumblr_msk2kscRBO1qi91wgo1_500.jpg</a> :&gt;</span><br />
[04:57:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah FL, that's not OP at all. that's just common gaming sense.</span><br />
[04:57:51] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: so much dogestep :&gt;</span><br />
[04:58:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: now if it restored you to /full/ HP every time, that'd be OP.</span><br />
[04:58:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
[04:58:16] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: is SJ still doing the glitch cave thing? having some glitch creature spawn and try to destroy the session could be cool</span><br />
[04:58:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But see, as long as he has focus ribbons, he could survive point blank /antimatter explosions/</span><br />

[04:59:06] <span style="color:#e69900">CFM: ♫ HellO ♫</span><br />
[04:59:08] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so it sounds like he figured out how to break the game</span><br />
[04:59:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I know everyone and their mom's taken the game logic to the umpth degree but</span><br />
[04:59:24] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is it /really/ that prevalent?</span><br />
[04:59:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CP's Emergency Point Swap would probably be on the same power tier or close to it; it refills HP by however much FP the wearer has at the time, but does NOT regen on its own so Happy Flower badges take care of that.</span><br />
[04:59:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: technically it wasn't completely a glitch cave, more of an LSD dream emulator esque cave. and she already got past that area. ➜</span><br />
[04:59:35] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh ok</span><br />
[04:59:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL, EP, what sort of "session-wide villains" would there even be?</span><br />
[04:59:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah</span><br />
[04:59:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like having the GMs introduce more would… :\</span><br />
[04:59:57] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: like i said, some kind of glitch monster</span><br />
[04:59:57] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: so what if five players combined their elemental powers and then a sixth person emerged from the elemental powers :&gt;</span><br />

[05:00:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: we only have 2</span><br />
[05:00:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at about 60 or 30 frames per second, this takes forever to get to max health with that thing</span><br />
[05:00:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: idk the minor villains concept intrigues me though.</span><br />
[05:00:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like realistically fatal wounds more or less just kill you, HP and such isn't factored in. It cheapens things treating them like that</span><br />
[05:00:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: having a temporary villain could work</span><br />
[05:00:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe something emerges from an abandoned land?</span><br />
[05:00:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus it kinda dulls the pain if he hits 1hp</span><br />
[05:00:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so he doesn't pass out from it</span><br />
[05:00:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: idk SL but</span><br />
[05:00:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and by dulls I mean /he can't feel it at all/</span><br />
[05:00:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: villains thing sounds cool.</span><br />
[05:01:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is how he manages to laugh off being stomped on by the Lich Queen.</span><br />
[05:01:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: the only problem with that would be the GMs.</span><br />
[05:01:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or talk after slaming into the Base at just under Mach 1.</span><br />

[05:03:02] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm bad with details :&gt;</span><br />
[05:03:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't know. Meh. Maybe a monster or a PC or something I don't /know/.</span><br />
[05:03:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: just have  a monster-of-the-week scenario</span><br />
[05:03:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm not a villain this go-round.</span><br />
[05:03:22] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: But multiple villains would at the least serve as a good distraction until Chronos gets his shit together :&gt;</span><br />
[05:03:45] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe have it feed on strife or hatred or something so we can have an excuse for the forced teamwork thing EP brought up</span><br />
[05:03:47] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: <a href='@RS'>@RS</a> would kill me if I went SCODE-tier, but the villains idea sounds totes cool.</span><br />
[05:04:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Get someone or something in for the Players to focus on.</span><br />
[05:04:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah</span><br />
