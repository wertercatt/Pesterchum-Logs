[08:35] CPK: (( The PKs are the dream luguis from Mario and Lugi Dream Team ))


[08:35] -- CURRENT monsterousMartyr [CMM] the fraymotif's effect is that it causes you to go berserk --

[08:37] CSL: but if i could damage him going in...


[08:37] -- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy [CCA] is so /so/ done with Chronos suddenly being able to nosell powers that aren't his aspect. So the crowbar is out now. --

[08:38] CFS: What happens when two black holes collide?


[08:38] CCP: PE, no. a black hole is Time and Space having a destructive orgy.

[08:38] CSL: charles, do you have a time bomb of some sort


[08:38] CCP: FL. I can't believe I'm even bringing this up, but... what happened last time Chronos went blapckhole, and your antimatter thing failed?


[08:39] CAS: It can, PE. Nothing can escape a black hole, not even light. So there could be light in it...


[08:39] CTA: Certainly, John.


[08:39] CPK: I do


[08:39] CMM: let me do the honors.


[08:39] CPE: ((or a chaos dunk))


[08:39] CEQ: Why not?


[08:39] CSL: ...or anyone, but charles is the most likely to have some insane time bomb stashed away


[08:39] CFL: ...


[08:39] -- CURRENT imagineBreaker [CIB] waits for the effects of either her power or the black hole... --

[08:40] CMM: ((What's wrong, FA?))


[08:40] CAS: A black hole isn't really a void, is it? It's just a bunch of really super duper dense matter.


[08:40] -- CURRENT powerKitten [CPK] waits for them to get sucked up --


[08:40] -- CURRENT chronologicNightmare [CCN] IB manages to touch, the black hole, power nulling it's breakdown effect but keeping her from passing the boundary of it's edge and thus leaving her in an awkward position of nulling it in a space that quickly fills over again --


[08:40] CPK: Guys


[08:40] -- CURRENT chronologicNightmare [CCN] stuck there more or less --


[08:40] -- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy [CCA] uncaptchas his wand-sword and starts casting an arithmancy spell on his crobar to increase it's forward vector by hundreds of times. As he does, his face pales and he staggers as he is nearly sapped of energy entirely. --
