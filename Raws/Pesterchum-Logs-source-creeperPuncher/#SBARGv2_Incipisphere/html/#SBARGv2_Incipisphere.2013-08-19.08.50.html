<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I was thinking about some stuff...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Do we have a back up plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: For what exactly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: In case shit hits the fan and we can't beat Chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: We are NOT fucking scratching the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not really, considering the fact that we can't scratch...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we CAN'T fucking scratch, AC.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we're a Post-Scratch session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: That wasn't the idea...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I just want to know if we have a back up plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Really, the closest thing we can do for a back-up thing is to get the ultimate reward as quickly as we can and run...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and what if that fails...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what if the ultimate reward gets destroyed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Then... Well, you can fill in the blanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So we just fucking give up?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: *Jade</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Meaning?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Meaning we leave the session...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, do you have said method of leaving the session? Because I sure don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: We pull a jade</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: thats how</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ^ </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Or just leave the incipisphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Got any thiefs or rogues of void?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that would help...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  the furthest ring is not something to simply be traveled through</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  what of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If we leave the incipisphere, then we have to deal with horror-terrors...</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I am as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: We could have him void up a fenestrated wall?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or her?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  thieves steal for themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: they would be stealing for themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  that is likely beyond my capabilities</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and coincidentally they would also be doing it for us</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Someone outside of the session would also have to void-up a wall that connects to said wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  one would need a rogue</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what if we... </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that would grandfather us the fuck out</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm sure we could find a way to leave the incipisphere and get through the horrorterrors...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but leave to WHERE?, is the problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What if we had something to clear a path?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Also, How long will it take to get to said place with everyone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: could take a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  not to mention</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: who's up for a road trip?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  HOW WOULD WE EVEN KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ^ also: A while with the horror-terrors... oh joy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What if we just through ourselves in a random direction</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and eventually crashed into another gmae?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: There's got to be a back up plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we always need to have a back up plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  but that's no back up plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: for everything that could result in our demise</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  you'd be flying in in a manner that's more than blind</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and fighting Chronos...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i'm sure someone</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: is going to die even if we do win</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: not winning would be unspeakable but it could happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: oh yeah, no question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  we're the alpha aren't we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we need an escape route or a place to hide out and recollect</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  then we gotta win</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I think so, but theres not really a way to tell...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we atleast need that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: EQ, you could be a casualty if we don't think ahead</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or FS</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or both</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or all three of us</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or our entire group</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -you say that as if I don't know already. As if lots of us don't know that already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm just restating it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm almost sure we all know</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm, fair enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: where could we meet up if shit hits the fan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we atleast need to know that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I think that task is mostly going to fall to our seers, they're the real tacticians</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i'm just a knight, I can't really do much else but fight and protect our tacticians and our friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: (our tacticians are also our friends)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Worrying about if shit hits the fan...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Is essential</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: On the other hand if there is a new universe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I hope they have a 5 Guys</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: But 5 Guys is delicious...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No, not that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We can't spend our every waking moment worrying about the possibility of things going peared shape. What we /need/ to do, is everything we can to stop that from happening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: We need to do both</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I spend a lot of time in the Ring, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: its more than likely we'll lose the fight and need to run</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm getting a lot better at finding my way around, plus…</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AG, you do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AG, are you void?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's really nice there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm a Thief.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I UNDERSTAND IT NOW!!!!!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: More thne likely. Don't talk like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AG, could you be the guide if we do need to escape into the RIng?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'd be lying if I said we could completely remove the risk...But preparing for failure and accepting it as an inevitability is the easier path to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm not saying it inevitable</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm saying its more than likely</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: From what I know about Chronos he's pretty fucked up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: More than likely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Yes</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: sort of</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its tricky to explain</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Hmmm... does anyone have anything to bring back to life?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: that is technically a valid use yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: an ally or carapacian</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that too</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: plus i like to think im pretty kickass with a sword</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Try to bring as many people back as you can before we escape.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fuckin support classes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: And if trouble comes your way, buff yourself to high heaven</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and if we don't have people dying</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: get on the front lines and buff yourself to high heaven</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: nonono see buffing /myself/ doesnt work as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fortunately i can use a good variety of weapons pretty well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: then you'll be a midclass thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i can also assist other guys on the front line</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Your inbetween the front lines and the support</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: kind of doing your own thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we'll avoid the rest?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just because I'm not on good terms with the classless doesn't mean they deserve to die. Although it would be a good idea if FS and I didn't go near them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
