<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Even Kat didn't give out as many death threats and she was ripped from the angstiest animes possible.</span><br />

<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: You don't remember when you three all agreed that me making a point of pointing out that she was making me out to be exactly like someone she hates because i did one thing similar was a point against me? Even though by the same logic, all planets with water should all be exactly alike?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: what a dick</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles is kind of a dick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Ok I kinda remember that but </span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: I mean like</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: you aren't EXACTLY like charles</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: That would be pretty hard</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: but that is what she said</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're just mostly like Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: /similar/</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: she said</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I was just like him</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: you have similarities</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't know man if I said "I'm going to kill a whole bunch of people by mailing bombs", that would make me just /similar/ to the unibomber.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: do not dare to cushun her words</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I could definitely see people hating me because of that /one/ similarity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: cushion</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and after all of that</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: she refused to hold her end of the deal</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: what was that again</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: if you would recall, I would listen to whatever she had to say on the matter, and she would listen to me in return</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I even reminded her</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If I had to listen to the mental backflips your arguing skills appear to be I would ollie into the sun too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: then you all left</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I can at least use logic, unlike you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, but it's circular and pretentious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: you can not even keep a story straight</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: As well as nitpicky and pathetic in casual conversation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's cool though good arguing skills are only something I'd expect from humans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I would not be whatever nitpicky means but i'll assume it's negative if I was shown basic concideration</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and if you all could hold a simple conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I had to be balanced because of their stupid stunt</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nitpicky is when you're far more interested in picking at the individual parts of something to appear more clever than actually taking it at face value</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait where are you</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I would not need to nitpick if the people i'm speaking to can see how idiotic their logic is. You are mad at me for making a simple conclusion ased on what information I had and reacting </span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: the other said I was exactly like someone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: even though I clearly am a different entity</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You took an inane, assumptive conclusion to extreme lengths, and then when those didn't work you used less extreme, but equally dumb methods to...I don't even know what you were trying to accomplish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Be a mild nuisance at best.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: on top of being idiotic in a simple conversation you also have no humor</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I am done here</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man what's the difference between two massive dicks and a joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: that guy cannot take a joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">CNV: If you say "no balls" or "no ovaries" twice in a row, you have to do the thing CNV: If they say "You're right" before the second "no balls" is uttered, you don't have to do it</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: proof</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, for the sake of the example I was using "You" and "They"</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Can it be a cute frog?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If I found a frog girl and made out with her</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Would it count?</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: NV dared someone to eat the soul of a monster just a while ago. i doubt safety is much concern here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#716604">CNL: and uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I would have to see it to see if it counted.</span><br />
