[08:28:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: new topic: holding right to win. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-yQ6doCYtk'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-yQ6doCYtk</a></span><br />
[08:29:02] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Ranged Underlings suck ass.</span><br />
[08:29:58] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: hrm.</span><br />
[08:30:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000c1">CURRENT matrixAssassin [CMA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:30:18] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Somehow, CP, I knew it was going to be Sonic-related.</span><br />
[08:30:29] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: What am i watching</span><br />
[08:30:33] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Also I've seen that before. It's amusing.</span><br />
[08:30:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: gotta go at a reasonable pace</span><br />
[08:30:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: especially the few high-tier underlings that got the "can use Brush" part of the Ammy prototyping, since /it's a ranged weapon with no effective max range technically/</span><br />
[08:30:58] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Ouch.</span><br />
[08:31:07] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: all my underlings can do is cast spells but i can pretty much</span><br />
[08:31:09] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: dodge them</span><br />
[08:31:10] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i think</span><br />
[08:31:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and ask youtube's related-video algorithm why, I was watching stuff about the Unleashed Project and this game up.</span><br />
[08:31:18] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: actually i don't think any of them have actually hurt me.</span><br />
[08:31:35] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh okay</span><br />
[08:31:36] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: your land is fucked up</span><br />
[08:31:39] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whats it called?</span><br />
[08:31:45] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is just glad underlings can't draw for shit --</span><br />
[08:31:51] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: land of volcanoes and vir.</span><br />
[08:32:36] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what is a vir</span><br />
[08:32:41] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Oh, that's because one of the people related to that project did that video, CP.</span><br />
[08:32:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Some of my Underlings can do water magic, and the most annoying ones do this annoying thing where they split into two equally-strong ones that have ta be taken out at the same time for it to stick</span><br />
[08:32:51] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Or rather, had relation to it.</span><br />
[08:33:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh now it makes sense</span><br />
[08:33:35] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: the worst thing my underlings can do is blast music at me.</span><br />
[08:34:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Whilst my underlings are not physically strong, most can fly and know how to set up traps, to my annoyance.</span><br />
[08:34:38] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Huh... I prototyped Science Raptors.</span><br />
[08:34:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I prototyped Cruxite.</span><br />
[08:34:54] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: except for those magic attacks.</span><br />
[08:34:55] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: To be honest, I'm not sure you would have firgured that out unless I'd told you.</span><br />
[08:35:22] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: 'Cause the way that I even know that is a slight bit obscure.</span><br />
[08:35:31] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( figured* ))</span><br />
[08:36:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, I forgot that I opened it from the guy's video page instead of related videos</span><br />
[08:36:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has too fucking many tabs open --</span><br />
[08:36:56] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Haha.</span><br />
[08:37:18] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Still, he does have relation to that project.</span><br />
[08:41:21] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: CP: Also, that last comment in the the description is kind of true, honestly.</span><br />
[08:46:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: memo seems kinda full...</span><br />
[08:47:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: perfect time for me to go to sleep</span><br />
[08:47:15] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: And yet relatively quiet.</span><br />
[08:47:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Paste bin the log if chronos shows up.</span><br />
[08:47:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wanna see it.</span><br />
