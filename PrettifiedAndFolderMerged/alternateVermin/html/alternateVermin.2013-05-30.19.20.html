[07:20] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Yo, Mr. Lord man!</span><br />
[07:20] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Yes?</span><br />
[07:20] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Seeing to notes I made in the past you should be in the memo about now.</span><br />
[07:20] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Anything I can help you with?</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Well, I suppose I can ask.</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Have you seen my alternate?</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Then do so.</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I have observed him yes.</span><br />
[07:21] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Have you observed him, well, recently?</span><br />
[07:22] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: About an hour ago I've seen him for the last time.</span><br />
[07:22] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: He went trough a gate on LoIaR, I was actually looking at the unfolding of another player's corruption.</span><br />
[07:22] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: But that is not the point.</span><br />
[07:22] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Well.</span><br />
[07:23] <span style="color:#802020">FL: What is the worse case scenario with this player?</span><br />
[07:24] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Runs into the wall multiple times on various situations, he tends to drink strong alcohol and respond with violence.</span><br />
[07:25] <span style="color:#802020">FL: ...So, this is the other player?</span><br />
[07:25] <span style="color:#802020">FL: I'm just making sure before I take measures.</span><br />
[07:25] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: This is your alternate self I'm speaking of yes.</span><br />
[07:25] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: He's no thread whatsoever.</span><br />
[07:25] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: threat*</span><br />
[07:25] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Atleast, as far as I've seen him so far.</span><br />
[07:26] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: What measures are you intending on taking, if I may ask.</span><br />
[07:26] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: And, what for?</span><br />
[07:27] <span style="color:#802020">FL: ...I assumed to were talking about the corrupted player.</span><br />
[07:27] <span style="color:#802020">FL: you*</span><br />
[07:27] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Ah.</span><br />
[07:27] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: No.</span><br />
[07:27] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: The corrupted player is a totally different case.</span><br />
[07:27] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: It's part of her land quest.</span><br />
[07:28] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Interesting.</span><br />
[07:28] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Quite.</span><br />
[07:28] <span style="color:#802020">FL: ...Was this land the land you had spoken to me last?</span><br />
[07:28] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Correct.</span><br />
[07:29] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Alright.</span><br />
[07:29] <span style="color:#802020">FL: So, would you mind doing a cursory search of the lands through the second gate?</span><br />
[07:30] <span style="color:#802020">FL: While I check the Land of Steam and Crossroads?</span><br />
[07:30] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: What would be my reason to undergo that action?</span><br />
[07:31] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: To search for your alternate self?</span><br />
[07:31] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Yes.</span><br />
[07:31] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Hold on, I'll ask a question.</span><br />
[07:32] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Your search however could be avoided by simply contacting your alternate self.</span><br />
[07:32] <span style="color:#802020">FL: I have tried that.</span><br />
[07:32] <span style="color:#802020">FL: He is not responding.</span><br />
[07:32] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Peculier.</span><br />
[07:33] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Most, peculier.</span><br />
[07:33] <span style="color:#802020">FL: Which might be either from him not wanting to deal with me, or him being in serious danger.</span><br />
[07:34] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I would assume he'd keep a reason to avoid you. You know, power difference and omnious threat of possible timeline annihilation.</span><br />
[07:34] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: But that aside.</span><br />
[07:34] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I don't think he'd be on his guard at all times for you.</span><br />
[07:34] <span style="color:#e12d00">AV: There's probably something up with'm.</span><br />
[07:37] <span style="color:#802020">FL: I believe I may be getting some answers.</span><br />
[07:49] <span style="color:#802020">FL: I would like to thank your for your assistance.</span><br />
[07:49] <span style="color:#802020">FL: You were most helpful.</span><br />
