<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...didnt your sister tell you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: she said something about being excited about going somewhere, but she kept saying stupid stuff like "we're going to the place with the thing  âžœ". she never actually says the names of placs and its annoying</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  heads into another room for a moment --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: its pretty awesome but kinda watered down in places</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ah, cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i prefer saint's row but gta is pretty cool too</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff790b">CCB: saints row is cool but it gets boring after a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: beating innocents to death with giant dildoes never gets boring</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT caniblowuupBoom <span style="color:#ff790b">[CCB]</span>  attempts to pick up a slice of probably greasy pizza --</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: even then, though, i like to go for the old stuff</span><br />
