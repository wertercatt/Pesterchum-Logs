[14:20:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Tactical Crash Laser just got shot at my computer ))</span><br />

[14:20:44] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((what))</span><br />
[14:20:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I think its a firefox bug. ))</span><br />
[14:21:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( You know when you have firefox open on youtube and it suddenly freezes your /entire computer/ so you have to forcefully turn off the power? ))</span><br />
[14:22:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Like the sound starts fucking up, then it stops, then you turn it off and it comes /right back/ the MOMENT before the computer turns off? ))</span><br />
[14:23:09] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: o-o</span><br />
[14:23:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what did I miss</span><br />
[14:23:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[14:23:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I said "Even Marsh figured it out at the end" and Rob was talking about Dae</span><br />
[14:23:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh huh</span><br />
[14:26:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yes this topic is very interesting and it is sure to change my outlook in life from here on out because the words were put infront of my face.</span><br />
[14:27:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't really expect a whole lot since over the course of the entire session you didn't reach any manner of catharsis or change, which is kinda the whole point of the game.</span><br />
[14:28:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I mean, at least give it some damn effort if you're going to be playing around with souls.</span><br />
[14:28:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[14:28:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You seemed to think it'd work when you went to Tumblr for a definition</span><br />
[14:28:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You do realize the entire growing up thing is just a theory, right?</span><br />
[14:28:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I guess.</span><br />
[14:28:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait, actually, there might be, probably /is/ canon stuff to the effec</span><br />
[14:28:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: *effect</span><br />
[14:29:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess you can lead a dog to water, but if it has antifreeze in it the dog is likely going to die</span><br />
[14:29:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Self-actualization is not a theory, however. Kind of the whole point of the god-tier system.</span><br />
[14:29:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well then I guess the game failed.</span><br />
[14:29:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if that is the purpose</span><br />
[14:30:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously, half of the session hasn't changed at all.</span><br />
[14:30:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if we have, its been for the worse.</span><br />
[14:30:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Speak for yourself.</span><br />
[14:30:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah I guess. For a lot of people they dropped the ball pretty spectacularly.</span><br />
[14:30:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am speaking for myself. I killed Kat, for gogs sake.</span><br />
[14:31:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That /can't/ be for the better.</span><br />
[14:31:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then again for a lot of people, their land quests either consisted of "How can I be super speshul" or "How many games and references can I shoehorn in"</span><br />
[14:32:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, my land quests were just failure after failure for me.</span><br />
[14:33:20] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[14:33:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If the game has taught me anything, its that I'm /not/ special.</span><br />
[14:35:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean granted I think you were too busy furiously shoving your genitals into anti-matter.</span><br />
[14:35:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How many times did I actually use it?</span><br />
[14:35:41] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: How many times daily did you mention it</span><br />
[14:36:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: true I was obsessed with coming up with ways to think of using it.</span><br />
[14:37:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're reckless.</span><br />
[14:38:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I think the only times it was ever used was to get rid of a False Denizen and to remove a /horrible/ ectobiological experiment from existance.</span><br />
[14:38:20] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're absolutely irrepairably reckless.</span><br />
[14:40:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean if it makes you feel better I could harass Rob about his title or he could harass me about my title but usually my fuckups are still in line</span><br />
[14:40:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Except for the ancient evil thing but I'm pretty sure 90% of things I've done involved some ancient evil</span><br />
[14:40:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You don't /think/ about the consequences of your actions you just. /Do/ things.</span><br />
[14:41:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And for most people that's bad but its not the worst thing in the world.</span><br />
[14:42:08] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Back home, on Earth. Some guy decides he wants to be reckless and test traffic, he ends up in an accident. Best case he walks away with injuries and the car banged up.</span><br />
[14:42:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Some guy straps on a dumb suit and jumps off a building, reckless. Smashes into a car and kills himself, car's ruined, his life's over.</span><br />
[14:43:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Recklessness is one of those things that society has a way of ironning out for the most part</span><br />
[14:45:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But we haven't got society. We've got a bunch of aliens and kids and young adults either completely out of their league or too weak-willed for the most part to enact any real regulation or change.</span><br />
[14:45:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And also people that can't die for the life of them.</span><br />
[14:46:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And we haven't got some John Doe we've got. Yeah. Someone who's functionally immortal, and with mind-boggling powers and a host of items capable of insane destruction</span><br />
[14:46:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When you're reckless a planet dies.</span><br />
[14:46:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or other people do.</span><br />
[14:46:56] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When you're reckless you nearly kill everyone in your immediate radius. </span><br />
[14:47:12] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When you're reckless you lead to Kat dying.</span><br />
[14:47:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When you're reckless /bad things happen/ and the worst part is, you just</span><br />
[14:47:35] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: don't</span><br />
[14:47:35] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: learn</span><br />
[14:48:09] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You don't check yourself or try and correct your behavior. You don't make /some/ effort of reigning it in.</span><br />
[14:48:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do a pretty good job of blaming the game or saying it's not worth it or complaining about faliure and moving on to flail around in munchkin land some more.</span><br />
[14:49:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A year passes. You make a regular habit of dying and putting everyone in jeopardy. /Nothing changes/.</span><br />
[14:49:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The Chaos Dunk debackle. Your stupid AI. You /new/ stupid AI. </span><br />
[14:49:56] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Kat.</span><br />
[14:51:16] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What next?</span><br />
[14:51:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just in the past few days that stupid Skaia.net hub or whatever came close to nuking us all ot kingdom come.</span><br />
[14:52:01] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What next week?</span><br />
[14:52:32] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I don't know what I'm flapping my gums for. You had a year and then some to adjust yourself the /slightest/ bit, the /slightest/.</span><br />
[14:52:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And you sqandered it.</span><br />
[14:53:18] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So here's an idea. Instead of wondering what your title is, and trying to be a better Rogue of Heart?</span><br />
[14:53:27] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Try being a better /human being/.</span><br />
[14:53:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
[14:53:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll be better by locking myself up</span><br />
[14:53:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[14:54:00] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Nah. </span><br />
[14:54:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I lock myself up, I'm not a danger to everyone, right?</span><br />
[14:54:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're the worst. The absolute worst.</span><br />
[14:54:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Dude.</span><br />
[14:54:17] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You are  full of /shit/</span><br />
[14:54:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Are you serious right now</span><br />
[14:54:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: "Try being a better human being" </span><br />
[14:54:37] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You keep talking about how change is so hard? Have you even /tried/?!</span><br />
[14:54:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: WELL I SHOULD LOCK MYSELF UP</span><br />
[14:54:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: HAVE YOU TRIED ONCE TO TAKE THE HARD WAY?</span><br />
[14:55:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: LOCKING YOURSELF UP BECAUSE THAT'S LESS EFFORT THEN MAKING AN EFFORT.</span><br />
[14:55:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I hate laying into anyone at this kind of level but jesus he's got a point, every single time I've ever thought about anything you've done it's always taking the easy way out.</span><br />
[14:56:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Cheating, having your planet blown up, locking yourself up, making totally broken items, and antimatter is the kingpin shining diamond of "the easy way out"</span><br />
[14:56:11] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: HAVE YOU EVEN ONCE TRIED WITHOUT WRITING IT OFF AS IMPOSSIBLE?! HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING BUT BITCH AND MOAN ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS?!</span><br />
[14:56:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ........</span><br />
[14:56:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Breath.</span><br />
[14:56:42] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Breath...</span><br />
[14:56:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[14:57:08] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...You know the saying "The journey of a thousand miles begins with but a single step"?</span><br />
[14:57:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: "Those who think they can and those who think they can't are both right"?</span><br />
[14:57:49] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Any of the /numerous/ sayings that ammount to the first step being the hardest?</span><br />
[14:58:37] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You've sat here this whole game either blissfully running around the lobby playing with your toys, sure that there's nothing wrong</span><br />
[14:59:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: or sitting at the foot of the staircase complaining about how big it is, how high up the first step is, or denying its there at all</span><br />
[14:59:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Rob, are you seriously telling me about stairs right now?</span><br />
[15:00:00] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's a fucking metaphor.</span><br />
[15:00:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Holy fuck Charles.</span><br />
[15:00:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The stairs are self-bettermen and you're the fat piece of shit at the bottom.</span><br />
[15:00:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have never met somebody who is so supremely useless.</span><br />
[15:00:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, tell me if you would want to try to go up that staircase after falling down it /so many times/.</span><br />
[15:00:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I did.</span><br />
[15:01:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I ran around that lobby with a mask and my toys because I thought it was the only way to make something of myself.</span><br />
[15:01:49] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That being someone else was the only way I could ammount to anything.</span><br />
[15:01:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: This is where my amazing metaphors about getting your ass kicked come in.</span><br />
[15:01:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...welp its at this point I figure we both realize that nothing is going to change the other persons perspective</span><br />
[15:02:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Success in a session and things in general, and especially about changing yourself for the better isn't about how many times you get pushed down the stairs.</span><br />
[15:02:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's about how many times you get off of your ass and go right back up them, and maybe along the way learn all the little nuances in each step.</span><br />
[15:02:37] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: "It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down, just that you get back up"</span><br />
[15:02:54] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But you just get up, bum rush the steps, and then cry when you get pushed down. You don't take them slowly, you take the easy way or bust.</span><br />
[15:03:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's not this point where I realize that nothing's going to change your perspective</span><br />
[15:03:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm just flapping my gums. I think I already knew that.</span><br />
[15:03:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: This is the point where I realize I'm talking to a little kid who's never known what a challenge is, so you don't even have a perspective</span><br />
[15:04:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You have a stick in the mud you're furiously jerking on</span><br />
[15:04:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[15:05:30] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Have you actually tried? I mean really tried?</span><br />
[15:06:10] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: All you do is complain about how irrepairably broken you are but its not by virtue of any mental break or anything wrong with you somehow</span><br />
[15:06:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's just you.</span><br />
[15:06:54] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You look at the staircase and imagine a million ways up but its so hard, you never make good on any of them.</span><br />
[15:07:35] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If you'd made even the slightest growth, the slightest change. A step in the right direction, after everything.</span><br />
[15:08:11] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But you're still the same reckless son of a bitch you were at the start who doesn't give a shit about who he hurts.</span><br />
[15:08:44] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The only difference is you've got some powers you don't even know how to use and a metric ton of dangerous items and weapons.</span><br />
[15:12:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So. Nothing?</span><br />
[15:15:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: In a completely unrelated but probably useful note, me and Max went back to the Library Rob and Isaac and I talked to the HoloBaoth.</span><br />
[15:15:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Right.</span><br />
[15:15:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ah, well... Anyway, yeah that sounds wicked.</span><br />
[15:15:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What'd he say?</span><br />
[15:16:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: A lot of things.</span><br />
[15:17:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We didn't ask about trading cards again that's for sure.</span><br />
[15:17:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But from the looks of it this Cal girl is from some kind of dead session originally.</span><br />
[15:17:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like Caliborn-tier dead.</span><br />
[15:18:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not just y'know every other session imaginable dead.</span><br />
[15:18:27] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A Dead Session, then.</span><br />
[15:18:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Caps helps</span><br />
[15:18:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeesh...</span><br />
[15:19:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Isaac asked why she was so uppity, Holo said because of the session, Isaac asked to see her Choice.</span><br />
[15:19:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And so we saw it.</span><br />
[15:20:20] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And?</span><br />
[15:20:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And it was an acid trip.</span><br />
[15:21:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { actually since I kinda had to go about halfway through I still gotta wait for gCP to get on to finish it }</span><br />
[15:24:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I think at the very least I get it now, and Max and I got some maps from this edgy loser.</span><br />
[15:27:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So at the very least I have a lead!</span><br />
[15:31:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: toast me when Kimura gets on.</span><br />
[15:31:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have something I need to send him.</span><br />
