<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Cloud originally wasn't even supposed to be as angsty :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean they took cloud as he was for like 5 minutes during an emotional breakdown</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: art from vii side by side with dissidia art</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and then made that his entire character</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah ive seen that</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: "mostly i just..."</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: "want to be forgiven."</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: brood brood angst</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean, if you play the first part of  ff7 clouds kind of an asshole</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: uggggh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I actually have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i should hope</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Cloud originally was actually sort of like a socially anxious John Egbert :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ff7 is a great game but everything about its fans and its expanded universe is awful</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He liked to prank, but he didn't know social situations and he didn't know what to say :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: is there still a sa paywall?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think one of the directors actually admitted "His character was more or less made into this angsty brooder-type to pander to the fans"</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: If you notice Zack Fair's character, that's what Cloud was originally supposed to be. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont know since i have an account c:</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not in those exact words but basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Zack Fair's like this mercenary, but he's really carefree, too :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah someones lping the chinese bootleg nes port of ff7 and the op is a huge parody of 13-year-old gamefaqs ff7 fanboys</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and its /awesome/</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Kinda ridic for me to rag on what they've done when admittedly I haven't  played all or even most of the way through FF VII</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And Cloud while he did have a lot of emotional stuff, it was sort of well hidden and he was trying to mimic Zack's personality :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Since he pretty much impersonated Zack from the start :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No paywall, awesome</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Tvtropes sums it up pretty well: :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Flanderization: If you haven't played the original game, you'll be surprised at how non angsty Cloud was. He did angst and express hesitation and insecurities, but only at key points and for good reasons, and at the end of the game seemed perfectly fine. In his appearances since, he has been an angsty brooding loner. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He still had moments of angst throughout the game, but when it happened, there was good reason and it was during key points. Like Aerith's death and when he learned that his memories were fake. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But outside of that, :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He was like this adorkable dude :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sword just /barely/ held, almost at the ground. Sullen expression cast downward as if to say "why bother". Slumped position to suggest much the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's funny, though, if you think about it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, throughout the compilation :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Cloud's and Sephiroth's personalities got swapped :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: guess so</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like Sephiroth was originally really brooding and moody and dark :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But in later releases :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: he was just sort of a smirking villain :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Flanderization: Invoked in-universe. After his second death at the end of VII, he survives dissolution in the Lifestream by focusing on his hatred of Cloud and his desire for vengeance, giving him a strong enough emotional core to maintain his sense of self at the cost of letting less-focused traits be stripped away. This is why, come Advent Children, he's completely absorbed in rubbing his revival in Cloud'</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah, invoked :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I suppose that makes sense, then :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I just thought it was kind of interesting how in later events of the stories, their personalities kind of swapped with each other. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So he's got an excuse, at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though at least with Sephiroth, he sort of has an excuse :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, speaking of FF VII, Tifa is my headcanon for SA. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aeris might have an excuse in being /dead/. Like I dunno, maybe being dead doesn't give you much room to be all minxy and such</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I forgot why Aeris had to die, though I know Sephiroth had some reason or another. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's funny that her final limit break is only obtainable after she dies. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Funny, not haha :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just sorta ironic :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if you want a headcanon for my character, at least voice-wise, just watch some retsupurae and listen to diabetus</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought it was the opposite, her last Limit Break was available super early </span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So your headcanon voice for your character is Wilford Brimley? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Nah, RS :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no diabetus the internet person</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It was everything that VII should have been, imo :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: vi is best</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It was even darker in subject matter than VII, but it masked the darker nature with more lighthearted characters :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It has a ton of comic relief, but it talks a LOT about death :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And Vivi is both the cutest and most tragic character ever :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Just thinking about Viv is like "aww, so adorable" but then comes the feels :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We need</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A good battle-system in place for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: we could just do a simplified d20</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Strife tournament? :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: plus i think theres free hs combat systems out there</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah i was thinking of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: we all enter characters and then have a tourney</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Interesting idea, getting it done would take a miracle but I'd be game</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: or we could just have it  freeform and have a ref to stop godmodding</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That might work</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: it could just be a bracket where the battles just happen when 2  players and a ref are online</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: assuming it's in the Dojo, Ash already has a basic d20 attack/defend system for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh ok we can use that</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Meh. I don't really like the d20 system just because it's simply OOC luck, not so much character skill.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think we should do freeform with a ref</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually yeah, freeform would be more fun...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Freeform is hella more fun. It's why I tend to fight not in the dojo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also it shouldnt be a bracket system it should be a grid system</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so nobody loses in the first round and then just watches bored for  the rest of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: should i bring this idea up ic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe not today with how much Incipi is exploding plus EQ's event later tonight, but yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: l8r.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: tourney = funfun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Would /team fights/ be like an optional event?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: yeah... I mean i was gonna start the thing earlier, but... explosion</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: that i can dig</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: though im not sure on the logistics</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: it'd be an excuse to force peeps to work together.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: yo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: plus it would let me enter my alt without having a boring "face myself" situation</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I was thinking like a solo grid</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: idk</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ._.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: lets do a solo grid and then i guess i could hand over sl or lk to someone else for their round?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: or</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: they could /not fight each other/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well if we do a grid theyd need to</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't even know what you're talking about so yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: grid means everyone fights everyone else once</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: as opposed to an elimination bracket</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: that'd be kinda fun I guess yeah.</span><br />
