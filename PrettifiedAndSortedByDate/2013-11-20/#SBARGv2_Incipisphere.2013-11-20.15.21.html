<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, the party got split (you guys took Ash's basement entrance, while we took my Closet Door shortcut), much afkness ensued, then I just went over and locked the other door, the one the thing was about))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ((...no clue what you talking about.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Oh, so uh, let me give what /actually happened/ ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( The door that had the computer hooked up to it was ripped out of the wall, with shreds of the screen and computer components ripped apart... from inside. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((is there something wrong with me?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Missingno can't get out of the game due to the instability of its own code. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( No, its fine. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so other question, did Rob's heartswapping of you and Crux stick, or did it undo itself somehow?))</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Terminal? Door?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But no, I just /had/ to feel like I had to prove myself against a strong opponent...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, there was this Door in the magicant that I guess makes Game Cubes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kimura, you know the map around peaches castle, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could you explain how I managed to go in the wrong direction?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, the castle exterior, or...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Interior.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, /right by/ the fire sea level entrance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I hate Dire Dire Docks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay. well, assuming the proportions are the same between 64 and 64DS, the portal to Dire Dire Docks /is/ only a few steps away from Bowser in the Fire Sea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its a bit of a path to get from the basement to the front door of the castle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you actually could have tripped over something right as you exited (idk what though) and fallen in...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its also a wall to floor gravity shift.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, after I managed to fly back up to the magicant, you guys had already gone through.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like what you did to the door, but did you really have to blow up the terminal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .../we didn't/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I just waited for you guys for a bit, then padlocked the terminal door, and headed back through the closet door to LoFaT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So perhaps Mewtwo blew it up so... something didn't go after him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe Mew?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( FUCK GET THE DUCT TA- oh wait chronos killed the furbys ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((were those last two lines even supposed to be ooc? they seemed ic to me))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CIA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( did you miss the retcon ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...idk?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what even.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you padlocked the door, and yet it was /torn off the wall.../</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Either we can blame aliens and ignore that, or Mewtwo fucked with your memories.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ....What? /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe someone put it back on the wall, but not connected all the way? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No its... pretty torn off the wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the terminal seems like it exploded from the inside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, did anyone even notice if it was only propped up but not hinged or anything? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if it was from the inside... maybe Mewtwo deliberately overloaded the door?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: o<span style="color:#730e8f">.0</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, the door was ripped off the wall... Like, this seems like Telekinesis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, grabbing something inside of the computer and /yanking it out/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's just weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets blame Aliens/Mewtwo/Glitches for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For what seems to be an error in your memory...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh btw, Ash, you didn't completely delete your planning progress on v2Ronpa right? after things quieted down later, a couple of us wondered about still trying to do the "our existing v2 chars in the DR universe" version... since forcing everyone to use new self-inserts makes it feel a lot /less/ connected to v2...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, meta-stuff like that... just blame weirdness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or memory fuckage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: shrug ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((No i still have the notes))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the question still remains... why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering Mewtwo is a powerful Psychic type, it makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah, why didn't he just kill you guys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...no idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok, good. reading back over the log, it sounded like you ragequitted the original idea entirely... just wanted to check ;) ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would he have a reason to straight-u kill strangers? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *up ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doubt it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats... something that points away from Mewtwo being responsible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but maybe it did it to /protect/ us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or... one of the two did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((I'll make a memoi about it because I dont know what was discussed after I fell asleep last night))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'll just send you the log))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Memos up anyway))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, that makes sense, after all, Missingno was in the game, and that might... be dangerous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But is Mewtwo a good guy... thats the question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, do any of us look like we could belong to Team Rocket? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dammit, I hate this orange and blue mortality shit.</span><br />
