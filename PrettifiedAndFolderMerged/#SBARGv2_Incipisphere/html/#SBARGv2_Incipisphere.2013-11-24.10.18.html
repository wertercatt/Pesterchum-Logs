[09:26:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ, link and approximate time you're at?</span><br />
[09:26:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Wild, presumably hostile, Lv100 Mew.</span><br />
[09:26:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Loose… waaait. /Clones/.</span><br />
[09:26:57] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Considering it already killed something, then I think its a safe bet to pin it down as hostile- Eh?</span><br />
[09:26:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's one of those videos RS linked to about an hour back. ➜</span><br />
[09:27:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Crux is a mutant clone of Buddy.</span><br />
[09:27:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … So if it's going by /that/ motivation...</span><br />
[09:27:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he linked a bunch... also huh?</span><br />
[09:27:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ectobiology.</span><br />
[09:27:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What other clones are there?</span><br />
[09:27:47] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: EQ trust me, you're not the only person wondering why so.</span><br />
[09:28:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...It might not have realized where it was at the time.</span><br />
[09:28:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hmph</span><br />
[09:28:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Pawssibly/, FL. But before we start doing ecto, are there any other known clone-things?</span><br />
[09:28:17] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: wait... clones?</span><br />
[09:28:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pretty much all of the frogs?</span><br />
[09:28:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Mewtwo?</span><br />
[09:28:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So it can be expected to show up around LOFAT again.</span><br />
[09:28:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, "huh?" as in "wait that's who Crux was cloned from?"</span><br />
[09:29:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[09:29:16] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...if a MewThree appears, I'm Punching whoever to blame for it. that is all.</span><br />
