<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And the point isn't an empty apology.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: would it make you guys feel any better that I admit to being a horrible person for running a shipping blog? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why dont you turn your need to explain towards shit that matters</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The point is you're doing some seriously creepy stuff, not acknowledging it's creepy, and then....</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Trying to change the subject to you being a soulless PoS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why dont you help track chronos, or assist people with land quests</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: instead of trying to find some nonexistant laws of physics</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I can find some underlying, cosmic rules</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe I can undo the damage this game has caused</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles, there is only one rule.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Surprise, the game exists to propagate a new universe. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: In the vast unexplainable beauty of the cosmos, there is only one rule.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ "Undoing the damage" would doom us Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ as the jimmies rustle across the vastness of space no being knows peace. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: look, I know you hate this game as much as everyone else here, but it would be a lot nicer if we weren't all trying to tear eachother apart. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: verbally ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Am I the only one that actually likes this game?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My long term goal is to shatter the wall between life and death</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but for now, I need to settle for beating this game</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And your way of doing that is...shipping and troping people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My sides are generating enough energy to become the new universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: tactics!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: speaking of the new universe, anybody seen ash?</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I saw her earlier today. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I saw her at the coliseum earlier.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How about getting your face punched in sounds good to me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and its not like there is any bottle caps I can collect in this session</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: go play more sanic 06 or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: there are options available to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow, no wonder you're such a miserable failure, you're even trying to rip your hobbies off of video games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nothing wrong with ripping shit off from video games</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: my left arm is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: from a video game</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, if I wasn't such a nice, subservient woman, I'm sure you guys would hate me too. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But ripping off your whole life? Barely letting an original thought grace your brilliant catalogue of video game references?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's kind of wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles take up like, knitting or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sj you arent subservient</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and no one hates you for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I mean the shipping ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe I should collect stamps</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I am a freaking shipper ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and you guys hate shipping ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and that is creepy</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: therefore I should be labed as a horrible person ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but you dont let it consume you like fl</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *labeled ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you're just making excuses.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay, sure. You're a terrible person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: look if it was just the shipping it wouldnt be a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its that hes so disconnected from reality</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im just getting sick of romance in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean. Don't get me wrong, I love romance. I keep a hidden collection of dollarstore fluff novels in my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I don't sit on the sidelines saying "Oh shit, SL said Hi to SJ! Moirails, fo' sho'."</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im just sick of everyone talking about their romantic entanglements</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its all thats happened lately</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey isn't that a "romantic plot tumor" ooor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: exactly</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dunno, maybe i just dont like it because it reminds me of how lonely i am</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ah yes, the deep plight of the single dad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well, there goes my plan for the sword upgrade</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...guess so</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but i mean even in the old world i couldnt find anybody</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why does it cost /that much grist/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD IT WITH THIS HOARD!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably because not many people in here even know how to flirt or get into a relationship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what are you trying to make FL? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's just idle glances across the way until they makeout or become fuckbuddies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I tried to combine my Roentgenium Sword with a Captcharoid of Kid Radd</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or use quadrants as a buffer because well, Allah only knows.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: mostly for the mega radd</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but fuck im desperate enough just about anybody can come to me and ill roll with it</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont even care</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Find somebody you want to get to know more and ask them on a date</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's literally that easy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: question</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you make it sound so easy</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It -is- easy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just cant stand the idea of rejection</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: there it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you even know how a rejection feels?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont want to</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Spoiler alert: It's a pretty good feeling. You don't need to worry about the hypotheticals, it's just done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...fuck, maybe i should just go for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Move on, do better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean some people seem to think confidence is spewing TTGL quotes but it ain't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's just not being bogged down by fears. Simple as that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So you find that nice gal, or that....spider...lady.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shes my /daughter/</span><br />
