<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  begins to deploy a large computer system, with a large dish sticking into the air. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  glaces at his DS, then recaptchas his computer system. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well you'd better make time!</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I figure if anyone would understand me... well, I figure that I have a little bit of time before he makes it far enough away I can't track him any more.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Cut the crap and start talking like a normal person!</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Very well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: You can ask me three questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, wow that's nice of you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: And I will answer them to the best of my ability.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay, where did you come from, and explain it to the full extent of your...ability!</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...I came from the scratched session that spawned yours. I had to travel through the furthest ring inorder to escape the effects of the scratch itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, thanks that answered a lot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Once the temporal inversion died down, I simply... turned around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What do you want, like, we're talking plans, objectives, motives, basically your whole villainous monologue but a lot quicker.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I did have to ask for directions though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Anyway, on to your second question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: My objective is to prevent your creation of a new universe, as that would undo the work me and all of my friends had done inorder to destroy Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If I ask who Chronos is, does that count as another question?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I am seeking my scratched self, as I believe that he would be the most likely to give up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Now, onto Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: And no, that does not count as a question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Perfect, so who's Chronos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Chronos was the player of time from the universe we were supposed to create. However, after killing off his teammates, he turned his views to our universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: With the help of the first guardian, whom he corrupted, he had managed to make it into our session, becoming the player of space within it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: It was then we were contacted by the horror terrors to stop him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: And thus, that is how our session began.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Now, you have one question remaining.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Before I go after my post scratch self.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What's your favourite colour?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...or perhaps his dreamself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Are you serious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah. What's your next move after finding Charles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...After collecting the logs of his communications, I will be going to skaia, to destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Without all those pesky meteors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Now, I must go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're not even going to try and fight me? I'd think your first targets would bet he space players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { be the* }</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  begins to rise into the air, and presses some buttons on his DS, which he points at the rift. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Without Skaia, you will be unable to complete the genesis frog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Therefore, I have no need to go after you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a damned good point alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: *The rift suddenly rips wide open*</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Farewell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Um...bye?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  charges through the rift, which slams shut behind him. --</span><br />
