[09:01:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "Now, convert BACAFE from hex and get the result. This should be fun..."</span><br />
[09:01:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wat.</span><br />
[09:01:57] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why is there a puzzle six reference here... ➜</span><br />
[09:02:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so they know about BACAFE somehow.</span><br />
[09:03:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...if its the telepathic alien I'm going to punch his face in the face.</span><br />
[09:03:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it had to have been someone who knows the significance of that hex number... ➜</span><br />
[09:04:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does that thing even have a face? ➜</span><br />
[09:04:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has a mouth.</span><br />
[09:04:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I guess I could break the teeth of.</span><br />
[09:04:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: F_L ➜</span><br />
[09:05:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Found a prime factorization calculator on the web.</span><br />
[09:05:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox391733184'>http://flmun.tumblr.com/blackbox391733184</a> !!!</span><br />
[09:06:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...son of a BITCH!</span><br />
[09:06:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp.</span><br />
[09:07:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So I guess we have to wait a month?</span><br />
[09:07:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that feels like a complete waste of time. ➜</span><br />
[09:07:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Man, this was as pointless as timesten.</span><br />
[09:07:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: at least timesten got us a gross picture of noodle getting snogged by chronos. ➜</span><br />
[09:08:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Noone wanted to see that... well, unless you were weird.</span><br />
[09:08:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: back to Generations, then...</span><br />
[09:09:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:13:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I find it interesting how the pages between said "alright" and "alright then", which are usually things that you would say as a transition, FL. Maybe the guy behind it is a mind reader or somerthing? ➜</span><br />
[09:14:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it would explain how it knew about <span style="color:#bacafe">bacafe</span> ➜</span><br />
[09:14:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not to mention how it got into your tumblr account ➜</span><br />
[09:15:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it gave back the customize menu. It knows it has nothing to hide anymore. Why the fuck did it have to play games with us.</span><br />
[09:16:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#6507ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[09:16:18] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...?</span><br />
[09:16:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........I just cracked the plot.))</span><br />
[09:16:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whatever it is was probably bored or likes watching us wrestle with math problems. ➜</span><br />
[09:16:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess so...</span><br />
[09:17:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Mind pestering me then? ))</span><br />
[09:24:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, I'm off to bed. Mark Pi Day on your calendars, its gonna be a... "big" one. ))</span><br />
