<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: guys, SP gave me a pocketradar for gristmas and I don't know how to use it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's some dots on the screen</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ....what color.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you tried moving while looking at the dots?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Dinah's alright, mostly on account of not having gone...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Was gonna send her but the Arkaiser took so long and i didn't realize they'd be called so soon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Arkaiser?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, apparenly a large amount of players have sprites that are still alive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The HH Arkaiser, to be exact.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I guess thats good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, so I gotta go check on Prospit and make sure everything's still going okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I was... wary, so I delayed in sending Scinence Raptor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...whats going on on prospit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus, it'll be interesting to see what *woof* effect prototyping has on dreamselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hopefully nothing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Becareful CP- there's a sniper on Prospit. be careful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How long ago was that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF: I found some sort of "Code Room" in the basement of the castle. if my theory's right, we can use it to continue modding and fixing the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think at LEAST before the derse fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: psst, that fire didn't happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( It didn't? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( WHY DOES NOONE TELL ME ABOUT THESE THINGS. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Huh... thats good, I guess....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((it did, but it's been decided not to talk about it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: back a little later</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is an idle chum. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Have fun</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( oh. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What? Oh, I must be going crazy. Must have been that time my dreamself drifted into BUBBLE HELL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what fire on derse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT issunJar [CIJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: ...Bubble Hell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I'm going crazy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ said there was no fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: He's talking about dream bubbles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Those things are terrifying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Yikes. Are you a Void Player, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I'm not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: From what I've been told, they're magnetically attracted to the Ring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just drifted one time due to waking up while flying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Also, I am about to Attempt SCIENCE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Or at least ALCHEMEY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How about we see if we can add a magnetic field to my sword...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't, I'm crazy low on grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I'm gonna try and break the forth wall... or at least the wall between dimensions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I would offer you some grist, but I'm gonna need all the grist I have (and can borrow.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been thinking, now that the gates are out, I might need to make some way to fly somehow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wouldn't do that, the glitch might cause it to break the universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ya can always make an unreal van.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, why not... some mechanical wings? Or a hot air balloon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was thinking of maybe something small</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ROCKET BOOTS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hot air balloons have a tendency to fucking explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: something with manuverability</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or rocket gloves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well, I'm gonna try anyways. First things first. Gonna make the KilladoStick. or The Jeweled Sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: SJ, how about a hover Chair?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wait wait...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Or a beenie hat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What, RS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...you what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: .../Really/ don't think that's a good idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we get it, your fancy supership</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps a gravity deflector?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alright full disclosure, I never beat Heaven's Feel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But I'm relatively familiar with the mechanics behidn everything worth knowing in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Among them... The Second Magic, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the what</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's a Type-Moon thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What the worse that can happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#e12d00">CURRENT alternateVermin [CAV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: Icarus flew high on his paper wings, he flew too high to the sun. Only to let them burn up in the atmosphere and to be sent spiraling down into the raging torrent below.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...other then being forced to crossdress.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Type-Moon works have a really interesting system of magic and magecraft. Technically what most people do falls into the later category, True Magic is a completely different class that few to none can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1: Said wings are metal, not paper or wax.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2: There are other options.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How about breaking reality such that every possibility happens at once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but that was because the chump was rubbing it in, and Chronos was still at the wheel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Basically, True magic is the immpossible, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ff660d">CURRENT squealingVermin [CSV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Strange. I remember that verse. But I can't really place it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hollow Ataraxia says hi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Or we could just use quantum superpositions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Then I expect to be punched in a face by a angry horde of time players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: I can assure you FF. Magic is in fact possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Hmm, I forgot that was a thing. Uh, a while ago, Kimura set up a dreamself/realself communication line thing to check in on LOSAC while he's on Prospit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS QUANTUM FIELD MANIPULATION.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NOT MAGIC.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny that, getting hung up on the specifics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: He says that the place is still intact, but a fair amount of carapaces are basically flipping the fuck out over Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Technocraft you could call it, to mirror Magecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: No, in the type moon universe, true magic is stuff that even MAGIC can't do. Like ressurecting the dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...okay, I need to stop being a type-lunatic for a moment. Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: How would that be impossible?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I do reme.. OOPS.. ALMOST SPILLED IT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: ((AV ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( THAT WAS AV ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /shot ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: And, uh, to "look out toward that weird crystal shape in from of the dwelling spire, I'm going to attempt to poke a thing"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: ((*front))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Third Magic is materialization of the soul...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I wonder if I might be able to manage something like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...dang it, I need some actual rest...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait IJ, that sounds awfully similar to what MG said beforeshe went glitchy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not swapping bodies everytime I try to take a nap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: anyways, gonna make the KilidoStick... right n-.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: HOLY SAKUYA'S MELONS, THE CRYSTAL RELOCATED!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#6507ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((this talk of magic aaaaa))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  connection has been lost --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((sorry TT.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Does anyone have something that could get me some actual rest?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: "did it work? I poked the map data for LOSAC to see if it could change." You're not kidding, it changed!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: oh my god</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: FL, why can't you sleep?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I turn away from reading up on Magic on the Typemoon wiki and he's already gone wow Jovin can you /NOT/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, everytime I rest in one body, I wake up in the other...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Oh. Basic dreamself mechanics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I just want blackness right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: # sbarg world problems</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Just go to realself-sleep normally, then get blackout-drunk as your dreamself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sweet, conforting all consuming darkness... okay now I made it sound bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But then that causes me to wake up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: I haven't actually tried it since I don't have one, but he said one time that the game doesn't parse sake-blackout the same as falling asleep.</span><br />
