<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  returns to his dwelling spire and considers shifting back to wolfsprite form, but remembers a hotel event is coming up in half an hour --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: So, CP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: You're part animal now, aren't you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, part-wolf</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: How does it feel?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Sorry for the odd question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it takes a bit of getting used to, but it's pretty interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm just glad the "black and white vision" thing is NOT a part that carried over in the prototyping :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Huh? Oh, hah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Yea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, Its not exactly black and white.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They actually have 2 color receptors, and can see color... but on a much smaller scale.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.mexicanwolves.org/uploads/images/dogvis.jpg'>http://www.mexicanwolves.org/uploads/images/dogvis.jpg</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm. so, instead of seeing in RGB, they see yellow and blue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...If anyone has a butterfly sprite, They should ask what they see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And yes, it seems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I really need to clean my bedroom. the box pile hasn't stopped getting taller, and now I can't get to my bed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll see about upgrading my computacts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what is this Hotel event everyone keeps talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: It's kind of a for-the-lulz roleplay thing SJ does from time to time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Can I join?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, an RP *within* an RP))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I know what it is, but FL doesn't. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ((Sbargception))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Seperation of player and character knowledge, man! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CCP: you said this one would be more drop-in/out friendly, right? CSJ: it's going to be a free-form one</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so yeah, just hop in anytime</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, uh, where should I go?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is it a memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's a memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ said it starts at 11:30-ish, so about ten more minutes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...IMPPPPPPSSSSS</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: asdfghjk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: in the meantime, I'm gonna watch the final episode of Non-Sbarg-Alternate-Earth Runaway Guys' Double Dash tournament. (holy mouthfuls, Batmansprite)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who pours gelatin... into a swimming pool?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  remembers that one Phineas and Ferb episode --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry guys, I might be able to make it later though.</span><br />
