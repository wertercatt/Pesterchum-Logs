[06:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I have a feeling it won't.</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: since you /made/ the clovers rather than finding them, after all.</span><br />

[07:26] <span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: It improves your luck if you're the one with the bigger piece if you break it, but nothing bad happens to the one with the smaller part.</span><br />
