<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#3a4961">CURRENT anomalousEntity [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi AE</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: seen the ppoottaattoo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just woke up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it's wonderful</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i'm watching ep2 of madoka. it's full of spoilery german wall writings that i understand. <img src='smilies/facepalm.gif' alt=':facepalm:' title=':facepalm:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *still reading* wow. This is amazing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I love these interactions between Andrew and Caliborn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: snarky bastard</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "You are practically the ringmaster of your own little dark carnival by now. And you're loving every minute of it. Don't deny it. "</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i still have my money on Calliope being the worse of the two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: Something's just not right about her - cherubs aren't supposed to be all sweet and friendly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa, double screens</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: that's why i said ppoottaattoo</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they all have massive hangovers...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: roxy seems to be used to it, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: welp, looks like they're gonna get it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: the TIGER</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0000c1">CURRENT matrixAssassin [CMA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: hurrrr</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi MA</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: hi peeps</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: have you seen it yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: seen what</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: ppoottaattoo</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: fuckin wasted</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: god they look horrible</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i still don't understand why dirk's a hangover</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: who the fuck knows</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he was the most resistant one to the "infection"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: that doesn't mean he was completely sober though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he was a little bit tipsy at best</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: he was running around like a maniac just like the other 3</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: he was probably just playing along</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: still gave him a massive hangover though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: clearly</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i'm still disappointed by trickster mode</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: we didn't see everything about it though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: are jujus dependent on the green sun?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i don't think they are though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i find it interesting how fanboys always rave and drool about how nothing in homestuck was planned, despite huss himself having said that he planned out half of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: a good portion of it is just winging it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what the heck is this "lololol" adventure and why does it only have one page? Can't these people just add onto an existing unclaimed adventure and screw with that instead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i don't think that hussie is as much of a genius as people make him out to be. sure, it's pretty off the cuff and tightly-woven, but he's doing it for a living, so I think he's pretty skilled at it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: the whole calliope/caliborn-spiral sucker-red sun/green sun-beta/alpha thing is really an expansion upon one idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: but i like the way hussie puts all the different things together</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: not that there aren't inconsistencies in the comic, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I must be going now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seeya guys!</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: see you</span><br />
