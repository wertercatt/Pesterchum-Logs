<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *what ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: I would say put down a link to SOS in the entrymsg for universe so people know there is another RP going on</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or at least mention it in the infopage. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Info page was my guess as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Yeah, it'd be confusing for people to go in and be like "where are the things"</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">would</span> not this eventually kill vanillav2 though</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the way I see it is: what does vanillav2 have ahead of it besides FL shenanigans, lounging at a bar, and lack of direction? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span> kind of makes the other with less players</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we at least want it to have the shiny new memos ran by the players. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Hooray?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Noice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Anyway, alright. I got that "backup" plan all formulated, don't know if it got a mention in skype but were we going to use the v2 memos instead of the SOS memos</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: I mean if we are springboarding off v2, might as well since everybody in there's probably gonna be here</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait what</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: No no</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: We are having SOS memos</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: to help separate the two</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Alright, then SOS memos it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: We could probably make a v2SOS_GenesGarden since I'm /pretty/ sure NN doesn't have any say on the IC memos like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: they don't, only General and Universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, we can probably still keep our character's sos developments transferrable or something, just that sos stuff happens in sos memos ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Gene's Garden is also mine</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: so yes, we can use this for a short while but because of continuity</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: we will not use it for long</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: yeah they can transfer</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and we can always have both memo-style memos open at the same time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, should we set up the IC memos for sos now? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Yeah, sounds good for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: i will begin that shortly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, set them up, but we're not actually starting the RP tonight right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: not tonight</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: today was just the first step</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though maybe we could have it in down-time mode ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Yeah we could just start it in casual mode</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: SL and Nico can get back to reworking SL's intro</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: a good portion of it is backstory that wont be told ic for a little bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: should i mention it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like the actual scene is basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: Which points do you think won't be told ICly</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: "ben shows up, hes missing an arm, he has a shotgun, and he has a radio"</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, that makes sense ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: we can put some more stuff into that page</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: then we can go about grabbing memos</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so since this is gonna be a more constrained rp, should we have legit combat rules in place?</span><br />

<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: I'll probably be in charge of doing the actual RP events since I'd be doing the DT events anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaf0e">CPK: hi SL</span><br />
<span style="color:#3d7a5a">CHC: and I usually just no-sell awful combat</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this is mostly because i really wanna do a defined loadout for new sl anyway</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: uh hey i mentioned it on skype but</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: did anyone figure out the theme naming for the villains</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i suspect it may be ffl1, but thats just because of "creator"</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: my second point stands regardless</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffaf0e">CPK: looking forward to doing SOS stuff, it seems a bit more fun then postgame derping</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what is the state as of the beginning of the rp</span><br />
