[20:17:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I have a feeling it won't.</span><br />
[20:17:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: since you /made/ the clovers rather than finding them, after all.</span><br />

[21:08:44] <span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: Well I /hope/ the answer is yes, but the obvious one is no.</span><br />

[21:16:41] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Is there any scenario that salt could cause bad luck?</span><br />

[21:26:07] <span style="color:#9f8a89">CCP: It improves your luck if you're the one with the bigger piece if you break it, but nothing bad happens to the one with the smaller part.</span><br />
