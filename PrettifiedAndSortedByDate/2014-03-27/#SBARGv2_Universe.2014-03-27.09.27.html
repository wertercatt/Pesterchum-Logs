[11:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, should I do the "you're not going anywhere" thingy to DT or not?</span><br />
[11:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *if she tries to abscond, I mean</span><br />
[11:54] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Nah.</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: That would only Piss her off more.</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fair enough.</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Plus, I and we know MORE about her now.</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure if I can do it now anyway, she changed to a Voider.</span><br />
[11:55] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I mean, she backed off when I went for her eyes. and she didn't like it when I did the nose thing</span><br />
[11:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, she doesn't like being physically attacked, huh?</span><br />
[11:56] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Seems like it, I think</span><br />
[11:56] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: The problem is, when I elbowed her, it didn't hurt her</span><br />
[11:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: was it before or after she aspect-locked your strength?</span><br />
[11:59] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Before.</span><br />
[12:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh... that's weird.</span><br />

[12:03] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[12:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: must be /non-aspect-powered/ strength that hurts her...</span><br />

[12:04] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: Θr dΘes it h▲ve tΘ be the hit-y thing?</span><br />
[12:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, magic that isn't aspect-based? hmm...</span><br />
[12:04] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...I have a Theory, but it's only a theory.</span><br />
[12:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I considered messing around with the brush, but I didn't want to interfere with the 1-on-1 strife unless it went too far...</span><br />
[12:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what theory?</span><br />
[12:06] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: She used Life to BOOST herself somehow so she could take a hit.</span><br />
[12:06] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: And too boost her strenght.</span><br />
[12:07] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Could she be a blood player, who stole other aspects/bonds players had to their aspect...?</span><br />

[12:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wha</span><br />
[12:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........it's possible.</span><br />
[12:07] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I fought a so called destroyer of worlds. Kind of cute, but angry.</span><br />
[12:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the hell kind of class would that be though? besides Thief obviously</span><br />
[12:07] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I'm probably wrong, however.</span><br />
[12:08] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: She DID mention when we talked about cronos that fighting a 2 apsect player was quaint, or something...</span><br />
[12:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Did you win?</span><br />
[12:10] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Nope.</span><br />
[12:10] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: It was a draw.</span><br />
[12:10] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...I think.</span><br />
[12:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's cool.</span><br />
[12:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Holobaoth called her a Page.</span><br />
[12:11] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: A page of what, I wonder...</span><br />

[12:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some folks think it might be breath ➜</span><br />
[12:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Somebody said 'What' like 'What' was literally the aspect.</span><br />
[12:12] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Gotta get going. later. CP, make sure to pass on this info if anyone else fights her.</span><br />
[12:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it might be Breath because she seemed pretty attached to it the first time we met her.</span><br />
[12:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: can do FF.</span><br />
[12:12] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Thank you, Kimura.</span><br />
[12:12] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: And she used Void powers.</span><br />

[12:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Gross.</span><br />
[12:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, we have Page class confirmed from the denizen's mouth himself, and three aspect candidates, Blood, Breath, and What.</span><br />
[12:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Blood?</span><br />
[12:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CFF: ...I have a Theory, but it's only a theory. CCP: I considered messing around with the brush, but I didn't want to interfere with the 1-on-1 strife unless it went too far... CCP: what theory? CFF: She used Life to BOOST herself somehow so she could take a hit. CFF: And too boost her strenght. CFF: Could she be a blood player, who stole other aspects/bonds players had to their aspect...?</span><br />
[12:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Life to boost.</span><br />
[12:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I could see that.</span><br />
[12:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Blood player who stole other aspects, maybe.</span><br />
[12:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We could check the Library for the 3rd time in a row</span><br />
[12:16] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu, libr▲ry?</span><br />
[12:22] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: This place where we talked to a hologram of a denizen or something and he told us a bedtime story.</span><br />
[12:23] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: O:</span><br />
[12:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we could probably check the place out again...</span><br />
[12:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean granted it was a bedtime story about somebody who wanted to destroy a universe so I wouldn't tell my kids it.</span><br />
[12:24] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: OO:</span><br />
[12:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Prospitian "fiction", I think one of you guys called it on the webcam stream?</span><br />

[12:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yaldabaoth.</span><br />
[12:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Yaldabaoth, apparently. according to the stream, the session was a six-"player" Dead Session because they all entered from the same house.</span><br />
[12:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I just called it "Holobaoth" because it's definitely not alive</span><br />
[12:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Apparently only she ended up making it to the lair or something</span><br />
[12:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe she just had friends over and thought they were playing fuckin Doom or something.</span><br />
[12:29] <span style="color:#000000">CFI: ...holy shit, she hαd the sαme denizen thαt i hαd</span><br />

[12:31] <span style="color:#000000">CFI: she definαtely meαns business if the gαme picked thαt denizen for her</span><br />

[12:34] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yaldabaoth is a tough denizen?</span><br />
[12:35] <span style="color:#000000">CFI: fuck yes he's tough</span><br />
[12:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Is he an all-around dick or just occasionally.</span><br />
[12:37] <span style="color:#000000">CFI: it might vαry between instαnces</span><br />
[12:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I remember Rob had something to do with him or something.</span><br />
[12:39] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yawn...</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey Rob what'd you do with Yaldabaoth</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh?</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh hi to you too I guess.</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I remember something or other about the giant lizard snake corpse thing in the center of the planet</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Something like that.</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I said Hi</span><br />
[12:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or hey</span><br />
[12:41] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It played into my land lore and a little more... Honestly I don't know for sure, whether it was my Denizen, /one/ of my Denizens, just a fixture in the history, or what exactly.</span><br />
[12:43] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That lore said it was responsible for creating the planet and for later down the line wrecking it. Apparently it died at some point before I even made it there, for Dae to end up using as robot material.</span><br />
[12:45] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And after the fight he put it back in the core where its body broke down.</span><br />
[12:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And usually that'd be enough but... It hadn't actually died, s'much as gone into some sort of hibernation.</span><br />
[12:46] <span style="color:#000000">CFI: wtf</span><br />
[12:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ahahahaha. Never accuse Sburb of having a straightforward mythology, right?</span><br />
[12:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's spirit, I guess you could call it its heart, persisted on and raised trouble but, you guys weren't really around for that. No big deal I took care of it.</span><br />
[12:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And uh.</span><br />
[12:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: to answer the question</span><br />
[12:48] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It was my kinda-sorta-maybe Denizen/Bonus Boss</span><br />
[12:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was just trying to figure out if he was a dick or not.</span><br />
[12:49] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mine was kind of a dick. But then it wasn't even so much as.</span><br />
[12:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It just operated on a wholely different moral wavelength, it had no real concept of right and wrong just its weird sense of godly duty and dogmatic standards.</span><br />
[12:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That sounds about like what me and Isaac saw</span><br />
[12:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny that.</span><br />
[12:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: At the very least it meant I could actually reason with it.</span><br />
[12:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Didn't even have to kill it or beat it.</span><br />

[12:54] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah?</span><br />
[12:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nothin.</span><br />
[12:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Apparently the baddy's denizen was Yaldabaoth so it makes her tougher or something</span><br />
[12:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or means she means business</span><br />
[12:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh yeah, I never had to kill my denizen either. mostly because the Grist Hoard was stolen and we /liquified/ the baddies who stole it.</span><br />
[01:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp I killed the memo again</span><br />
[01:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm mildly busy.</span><br />
[01:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: "busy"</span><br />
[01:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh</span><br />
[01:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I just don't really know what to do with the Yaldabubblebath info</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Besides take it and...write it down.</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That works</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I scored a free white board</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Might as well just</span><br />
[01:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: do shit with it</span><br />
[01:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool</span><br />

[01:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ..You'd be suprised how many people just hand out chalk boards.</span><br />
[01:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so... any particular plans today? ➜</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not that I know of? other than the FF/DT smackdown earlier.</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...what</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Is she dead?</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Please say yes</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I doubt it ➜</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...oh gog is Jovin dead?</span><br />
[01:33] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Apparently it was a draw.</span><br />
[01:33] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which around here means somebody gave up and walked off</span><br />
[01:35] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...He fought her?</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alone?</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Apparently.</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it was an honor strife after FF and FD turned the memo into a Machinegun Ohsnap Battle last night.</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but I was watching nearby, and would have intervened if it went too far.</span><br />
[01:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That alone tells me it wasn't anything super entertaining.</span><br />
