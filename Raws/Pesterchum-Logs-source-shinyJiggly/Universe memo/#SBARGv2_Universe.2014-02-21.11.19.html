<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....mhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can we get a hope player instead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....like myself?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....PO is no where to be found.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....as far as i know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....we both share the same classpect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....and then some other chick has hope powers, who i dont even know where she came from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....so basically, i get to be solo hope player until other people show up to say otherwise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay PW, I have this wooden charm for you that should allow you to break through any magical barriers you would come up against.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....okay, ill stop being an asshole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you need to /believe in it/, other wise it won't work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....well, i dont have the hope powers like a page.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....but being a knight should give me a reasonable amount of hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....say, do you have anything for doom players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just make another Yolo drill</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....yolo drill?.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOLO Drill.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....what is that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what the fuck is it with people forgetting things</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its that giant hope drill you made with PO</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....i wasnt sure if you were addressing an item for doom players of not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....that was Double Helix fraymotif.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....and we also added two-three rage players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we are going to throw it at whatever magical barrier is gonna keep you from saving Isaac and uh... whats his face.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....so it was basically a swirling drill of death, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....wait what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....Issac?</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....Isaac*.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....is that the odd Drifter dude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....what happened to him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fighting Brads friend in some sort of thunderdome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....why.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Point is, we are sending you in for backup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....now? or later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....because all i know is that Double Helix can only be performed with Two hope players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we only have one ticket.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....and a single hope player can do a hope-splosion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....but mine is limited due to my less amount of hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....but it just might work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AD, could we send in your bro?</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....i also want to ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....could, doom be of any use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....doom powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well we kinda need antimagic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....if we can find that thief of hope, i think we could pull off double helix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#020c32">CPW: .....i saw her at the bar one time.</span><br />
