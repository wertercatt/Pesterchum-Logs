<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it looks like you're off to a pretty good start. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: of course, some players are going to be driven away considering that you've expressed your alignment neutrality ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh yes. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I would have rather not expressed that, but I was sure it was going to come up. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Not to overuse the word, but I should have been a little more secret about the neutrality. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span> Sorry bout that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's okay. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: As I said, I was sure it would have come up, in hindsight, I would have probably been better not to have revealed that fact, though. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ah<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Okay, lemme ask if this sounds like aranea, if it is, I'll adjust the power accordingly :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So I'm thinking the way I get the secrets is I read minds, but not completely. I can only hear the thoughts that people don't want known. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: what is your aspect, byt the way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: sylph of void :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: oh, well, aspect void :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so I'm kind of making what's unknown known. Or pulling out of the void. At least, that's the idea. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I've had time to think about this. At least a solid three months. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm a procrastinator :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So I only thought about it like a couple weeks ago or so :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Welcome back, BTW, EP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, thanks. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's kind of an odd return because it will be more or less me occasionally stopping by. :&gt;</span><br />
