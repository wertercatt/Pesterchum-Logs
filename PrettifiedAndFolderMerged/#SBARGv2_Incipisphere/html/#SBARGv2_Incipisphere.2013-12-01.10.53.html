[11:02:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Chronos is dead, <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span> is threatening to eat our session, and Seth is on our side again.</span><br />
[11:02:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, Ash made the Genesis Frog, giving it the name of Gene.</span><br />

[11:04:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hahaha.</span><br />
[11:04:29] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: its possible</span><br />
[11:04:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't doubt it, I mean, its not like a giant frog would stop with just bugs.</span><br />
[11:05:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, Loki is a component.</span><br />
[11:05:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (loki is another frog)</span><br />

[11:07:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just tried to blame this crazyness on something.</span><br />
[11:07:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I figured.</span><br />

[11:10:55] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I still don't get why we can't just try to get our asses in gear in finish the god frog before it has the chance to eat our session</span><br />
[11:11:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:11:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well AC, what happens if it eats the frog?</span><br />
[11:12:37] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: what happens if we eat the frog?</span><br />
[11:12:45] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: well what happens if we don't give it the chance to?</span><br />
[11:13:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...GD, shut up.</span><br />
[11:13:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, we have to stop the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
[11:13:30] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because of this alleged forth wall i've heard so much about?</span><br />
[11:13:54] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ((yup))</span><br />
[11:14:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...AC, I'm pretty sure the Furbys are dead.</span><br />
[11:14:29] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: wait what?</span><br />
[11:14:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( He won't get it. Plus, we could just, turn off our side. ))</span><br />
[11:14:37] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I don't know what that means</span><br />
[11:14:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nevermind.</span><br />
[11:15:01] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what if we took the session</span><br />
[11:15:06] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: AND MOVED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE</span><br />
[11:15:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:15:32] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: what if we eat the session?</span><br />
[11:15:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because...</span><br />
[11:15:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think my brain broke.</span><br />

[11:17:02] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: im hungry</span><br />
[11:17:24] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and I just don't want to have anything to do with any kind of hole</span><br />
[11:18:02] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: But seriously, what if we could move the session?</span><br />
[11:19:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span> would expand to the point of consuming all of paradox space.</span><br />
[11:19:51] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: why do we have to deal with it</span><br />
[11:19:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eating both Space /and/ time.</span><br />
[11:20:00] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: what if we ate space and time?</span><br />
[11:20:05] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: maybe some trolls or cherubs or seraphs or other humans can deal with it</span><br />
[11:20:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its our fault.</span><br />
[11:20:37] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: how is it our fault, again?</span><br />
[11:20:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And thus, our job to fix it.</span><br />
[11:21:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Chronos made it, and we gave Chronos the power to do so.</span><br />
[11:21:23] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: how did we give him that power?</span><br />
[11:21:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pumpkins.</span><br />
[11:21:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or did you forget?</span><br />
[11:21:44] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Oh yeah the pumpkins </span><br />
[11:21:54] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: couldn't we engage multiple plans</span><br />
[11:22:04] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: incase we aren't competetent enough to destroy it?</span><br />
[11:22:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do have multiple plans.</span><br />
[11:22:28] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and what if we had one of them white holes?</span><br />
[11:22:32] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and we moved it</span><br />
[11:22:39] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and put it into the blue hole?</span><br />
[11:22:41] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: then ate it</span><br />
[11:22:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just all my plans suck.</span><br />
[11:22:56] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: well doesn't the blue hole take things in?</span><br />
[11:22:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like yours.</span><br />
[11:23:23] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so what would happen if something that perpetually takes things in were to come into contact with something that constantly forces matter out?</span><br />
[11:23:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, my first plan that I regarded as stupid was to blow it up with antimatter.</span><br />
[11:23:57] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Lan Hikari is moving?!</span><br />
[11:24:02] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS?!</span><br />
[11:24:06] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: WHAT EVEN THE FUCK?!?!?!</span><br />
[11:24:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh</span><br />

[11:24:49] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: YOU ARE ORANGE AND MEGAMAN IS BLUE THEREFORE YOU MUST STAY</span><br />
[11:24:53] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: they aren't even hard, bro</span><br />
[11:25:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah ha!</span><br />
[11:25:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You played this before!</span><br />
[11:25:20] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I played part of it before</span><br />
[11:25:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And thus, you are narrating for /no fucking reason/</span><br />
[11:25:36] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: My friend couldn't do the ending</span><br />
[11:25:42] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because he sucks at mega mans</span><br />
[11:25:49] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: seriously it took him like...</span><br />
[11:25:55] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: 50 tries to beat blast man</span><br />

[11:26:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, thats fun.</span><br />
[11:26:50] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I might actually be doing a patch</span><br />
[11:27:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Here, have a code for later.</span><br />
[11:27:48] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: HOW DO I PATCH THIS?!</span><br />
[11:29:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What is your favorite Navi?</span><br />

[11:32:27] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I remember it being easier than this</span><br />
[11:33:03] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: To patch these games</span><br />
[11:35:48] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Okay I found it</span><br />
[11:36:10] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I love how on an emulator you can get it to talk automatically</span><br />

[11:36:31] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: this patch looks pretty nice</span><br />
[11:38:46] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: FL is that a code for the chip shop thing?</span><br />

[11:39:06] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what chip?</span><br />
[11:39:16] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Is it a good one or just some bullshit chip?</span><br />

[11:39:33] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: oh nice</span><br />
[11:39:39] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you got any others?</span><br />

[11:42:03] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: The battle network games are really my favorites</span><br />
[11:42:14] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: also this patch is just kind of the same for the most part :/</span><br />

[11:52:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ?</span><br />
[11:53:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... What happened this time what</span><br />
[11:53:16] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: How exactly?</span><br />
[11:53:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: People suggested we eat the blue hole.</span><br />
[11:53:50] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: that was me</span><br />
[11:53:54] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
[11:54:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And because of that your brain is breaking. Really.</span><br />
[11:55:11] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: ....</span><br />
[11:55:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I got overloaded by both GD and AC.</span><br />
[11:55:49] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Just... give me a place to meet so we can get this idiocy out of the way, hopefully. Please.</span><br />
[11:56:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its fixing itself now that I'm have an intelegent discussion.</span><br />
[11:56:28] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -'s not gonna be as simple without CA here, but I'll see what I can do- Okay good!</span><br />
[11:56:52] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not sure how that works, but hey if it works then it works.</span><br />
[11:56:58] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: what if we got a sheep to eat the hole then ate the sheep</span><br />
[11:57:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: GD no.</span><br />
[11:58:31] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: The sheep, just like most other beings made of matter, would just spagettify.</span><br />
[11:59:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... I i honestly doubt spagettification would be all that pleasent, really.</span><br />
[12:00:35] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: if it becomes spaggeti</span><br />
[12:00:45] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: thats another reason to eat it</span><br />
[12:01:28] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: no it becomes one very long string or atoms that is what spagettification is.</span><br />
[12:02:17] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: we could still eat it</span><br />
[12:02:49] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Thats what black holes do to whatever comes in contact with them. The blue hole is just a black hole, but with glitchy properties making it annoying to repair. Also it is apparently growing.</span><br />
[12:03:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and have you ever tried to eat just one singular atom?</span><br />
[12:03:25] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If you can accomplish that, I'd be impressed.</span><br />
[12:04:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What would happen if we got the blue hole to spin so fast it became a ring like black hole?</span><br />
[12:04:22] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: woah</span><br />
[12:04:35] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: could we eat it then?</span><br />
[12:04:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no.</span><br />
[12:05:30] <span style="color:#4ec6b4">CGD: aww</span><br />
[12:05:53] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: If I SkaiaStreamed some games would you watch them?</span><br />
[12:06:02] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, that wouldnt get rid of it that would just change it so that is has a small chance of becoming a wormhole.</span><br />
[12:06:19] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: SMALL chance. as in 1/10000000000000000000000000000000000000</span><br />
[12:06:59] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and it might just teleport you into horror-terror country, knowing our luck.</span><br />
[12:07:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, I got the dumbest idea ever, but it might work.</span><br />
[12:07:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We just need two Portable Holes bigger than skaia.</span><br />
[12:08:13] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But yeah: all that would happen is that its point of focus would change from a spot to a ring though. it would still be there- what are you planning now?</span><br />
[12:08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember how I got rid of the Black Hole bomb?</span><br />
[12:08:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: By making a portable hole sandwich?</span><br />
[12:08:47] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... No.</span><br />

[12:10:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Noone, shes on our side.</span><br />
[12:11:14] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hmph... 'still a stupid thing to even think about making. Doesnt matter who you are...</span><br />
[12:11:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even for a Prince of Space?</span><br />
[12:13:06] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah! Granted it would be a biiiiit more fitting, but it still is stupid! Black holes do not discriminate! If one is there, it will attempt to spagettify /anything in its reach./</span><br />
[12:13:30] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What if we got lord english to eat the blue hole :P</span><br />
[12:13:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That would include the user, and anything the user may be need at the current moment Like ground- AC do not even start.</span><br />
[12:14:09] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What ever happend to that idea of using a white hole?</span><br />
[12:14:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The White Hole would just make things worse.</span><br />
[12:14:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think man, /think/.</span><br />
[12:14:56] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: how would that make things worse?</span><br />
[12:15:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You want to /add matter/ to an expanding black hole.</span><br />
[12:15:21] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: A white hole constantly forces out matter</span><br />
[12:15:29] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so what if it just cancelled it out</span><br />

[12:16:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No, its surface areas would just add... how would that sort of thing even work..?</span><br />
[12:16:48] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I don't think that's how it works EQ</span><br />
[12:16:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[12:17:07] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm assuming that it has something to do with gravity</span><br />
[12:17:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, a black hole is a collection of Mass Energy with a gravitational pull so great not even Light can escape.</span><br />
[12:17:16] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so if a white hole is constantly forcing matter out...</span><br />
[12:17:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you /add matter/ to it, its just going to get bigger.</span><br />
[12:17:41] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah, that is. When two black-hole like objects come in contact with another, their surface areas add.</span><br />
[12:17:45] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm assuming a white hole would be incredibely light</span><br />
[12:17:59] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because it forces matter out</span><br />
[12:18:43] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It doent even have to do with matter! -And I'm fairly sure anything with a negative gravitational force is impossible.</span><br />
[12:19:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EQ, it takes negative energy.</span><br />
[12:19:27] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Well its the reverse of a black hole</span><br />
[12:19:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which actually /is/ possible with exotic matter.</span><br />
[12:19:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait...</span><br />
[12:19:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, what do you know about Hawking Radiation?</span><br />
[12:19:54] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ooooh wait</span><br />
[12:19:56] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: never mind</span><br />
[12:20:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
[12:20:11] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: yeah but still</span><br />
[12:20:29] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: a white hole is something that can't be entered from the outside but matter and light can escape from it</span><br />
[12:20:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, a White Hole won't help.</span><br />
[12:20:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, it would just make things worse.</span><br />
[12:20:58] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: How about we take the blue</span><br />

[12:21:03] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and shrink it</span><br />
[12:21:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are trying to /remove/ the blue hole, not add to it.</span><br />
[12:21:08] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and move it somewhere else</span><br />
[12:21:12] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: like into a box</span><br />
[12:21:23] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: :P</span><br />
[12:21:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, the blue hole is already a single point.</span><br />
[12:21:48] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or what if we just destroyed all matter and light in the universe</span><br />
[12:21:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You /can't shrink/ a single point.</span><br />
[12:22:05] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so that it had nothing to eat</span><br />

[12:23:01] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What if we discovered another paradox space</span><br />
[12:23:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hawking Radiation allows for small black holes to disappear, correct?</span><br />
[12:23:07] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and we just dropped it on them\</span><br />
[12:24:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we would need to make sure that no matter goes into the blue hole for a period of time.</span><br />
[12:24:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No matter /or/ light.</span><br />
[12:24:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm suggesting we speed up the flow of time for the blue hole, and make sure it sucks nothing else up, allowing Hawking Radiation to do the work.</span><br />
[12:25:37] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: That's not how it works :/</span><br />
[12:25:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, this is based on my understanding of normal physics, and well, I have no clue at this point.</span><br />

[03:54:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the original megaman games, Duo was a robot. In battle network 4, he was an AI. On a meteor.</span><br />
[03:54:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Both were made to hunt down evil energy.</span><br />
[03:55:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the issue is, that the only difference between the orignal series and battle network was that in Battle Network, Hikari's Network Research was sponsered, rather than Wily's Robot Research.</span><br />
[03:58:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that doesn't explain Duo.</span><br />

[04:10:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right so, now to discuss /actual plans/ to deal with the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
[04:10:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, what does everyone here know about Hawking radiation?</span><br />
[04:10:47] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: no</span><br />

[04:11:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fat lotta nothin</span><br />
[04:13:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, Hawking Radiation is energy that somehow miracrulously escapes from a black hole.</span><br />
[04:13:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is why Microscopic blackholes tend to fade.</span><br />
[04:14:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was actually showcased in Problem Sleuth with the angels.</span><br />
[04:16:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[04:17:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, if we can contain the blue hole in a field of fast time, making sure light and matter can't get in...</span><br />
[04:17:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It /might/ be possible to let Hawking Radiation destroy the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
[04:18:34] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: "making sure light and matter can't get in" is an action that is easier said then done</span><br />
[04:19:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ornis seems to think FI and SF have it covered.</span><br />
[04:19:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why can't we just let them enact their plan?</span><br />
[04:19:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because the plan might backfire horribly.</span><br />
[04:19:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we might need a backup.</span><br />
[04:20:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think about it. The fate of the session resting on two players?</span><br />
[04:20:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seems a bit suspicious, if you ask me.</span><br />
[04:21:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Seems like a typical RPG trope, to me.</span><br />
[04:21:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Either way, it was foreshadowed in their Denizen choices.</span><br />
[04:22:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but considering how overused that trope is, it might get inverted.</span><br />
