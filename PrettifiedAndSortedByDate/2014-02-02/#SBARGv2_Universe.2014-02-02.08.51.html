[12:36:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey guys...</span><br />
[12:36:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:36:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi ➜</span><br />
[12:36:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:36:32] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mooornin!</span><br />
[12:37:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#941894">CURRENT moroseTerminator [CMT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[12:37:00] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Hello.</span><br />
[12:39:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So... I think we can all agree that our alien telepath has decided to move here?</span><br />
[12:39:54] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'Guess so...</span><br />
[12:40:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably??? ➜</span><br />
[12:40:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we should invest in a zero mass storage device.</span><br />
[12:41:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (aka a Captchalogue Computer)</span><br />
[12:42:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would help for storing raw materials for the Replicators, and would also allow for storing fuel and weapons, minimizing the energy needed to propel the ship with the interplanetary engines.</span><br />
[12:43:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how exactly would we pull that off tho? ➜</span><br />
[12:44:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the aliens in this universe appear to have fetch modi.</span><br />
[12:44:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What we would need to do is install a system that allows for the ships computer to have access to a sylladex.</span><br />
[12:45:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Array is likely what would be used in this situation.</span><br />
[01:18:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#fff8e7">Thoughts on this color?</span></span><br />
[01:18:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I thought whitetext wasn't allowed in the memo? ➜</span><br />
[01:19:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its our old cosmic Latte.</span><br />
[01:19:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh ➜</span><br />
[01:19:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 0xFFF8E7... yeah, its close to white I know.</span><br />
[01:20:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#9cffce">And the incorrect color to our universe was 0x9CFFCE</span></span><br />
[01:25:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm willing to bet the color to /this/ universe is 0xBACAFE or 0xBACADE</span><br />
[01:26:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably. It seems light enough. ➜</span><br />
[01:27:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((anyways, I gotta go. I have a date with EP. Seeya later))</span><br />
[01:27:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Have a nice time! ))</span><br />
[01:31:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, how are you doing, EQ?</span><br />
[01:32:03] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fine. I'm finishing up work for the day with Nemean. Yourself?</span><br />
[01:32:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I'm waiting for Kimura, since he wanted to do the AU Machine.</span><br />
[01:32:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, do you know of a decent method to get alien drool out of your hair?</span><br />
[01:33:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its sticking even after shampoo.</span><br />
[01:33:27] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh yeah, contact me when that happens as well, okay- Uh, no...</span><br />
[01:33:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eugh...</span><br />
[01:33:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm, let me google something like "how to get gum out of hair," and see if any of those suggestions work...</span><br />
[01:35:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: oh yuck most of these methods are messy :/</span><br />
[01:36:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Welp. It suggests peanut butter. But then again, I would assume that alien spit is different from gum, so... shrug. Good luck with that!</span><br />
[01:38:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I have a plan B.</span><br />
[01:41:21] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ?</span><br />
[01:46:16] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ooooh wait FL: Has anyone told you yet that Fluffy reccomended a certian type of ship, and so far it looks good enough for most everyone?</span><br />
[01:46:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, what does it look like?</span><br />
[01:47:04] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: One second. Fluffy called it a "firefly."</span><br />
[01:47:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ:  <a href='http://i.imgur.com/RwaRad5.jpg'>http://i.imgur.com/RwaRad5.jpg</a></span><br />
[01:47:22] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ:  <a href='http://i.imgur.com/5eC4REf.jpg'>http://i.imgur.com/5eC4REf.jpg</a></span><br />
[01:47:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It doesn't really look... cozy.</span><br />
[01:48:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True... But hey, thats what adjustments are for! I mean, taking this as a base, and adding on to it/removint from it sounded like the plan at the time...</span><br />
[01:49:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It also seems rather front heavy.</span><br />
[01:50:11] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But heck, it can land and safely travel in space, reportedly. Also fluffy said it can take a fair many types of fuel- Eeeeh... I can see the rear also being quite heavy on its own right, with the engine and everything being there.</span><br />
[01:51:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'd rather do something that would be able to fly in our atmosphere as well.</span><br />
[01:52:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No brain, no.</span><br />
[01:52:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No space helicopters.</span><br />
[01:53:03] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL if it can land, then I would assume that it would be able to fly in and out of planet-atmospheres.</span><br />
[01:53:11] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Also space helicopters uh</span><br />
[01:55:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I'm gonna captcha my shades.</span><br />
[01:56:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: alrighty</span><br />
[02:01:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And done.</span><br />
[02:02:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Got it out of my hair at least.</span><br />
[02:02:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, just ignore the scorch mark on the ground outside the Bar.</span><br />
[02:02:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Good Job.</span><br />
[02:03:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might have gone a bit overkill, but it got rid of it.</span><br />
[02:03:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm...</span><br />
