<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does the touch screen say?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it says the usual thing when you haven't touched anything yet. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's see here... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think so? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, tap on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should be an option to scan an item.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, found it ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, stick the jar of numbers on the pad thing? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should manage to scan it without destroying it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, it's doing the scanny thing now. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how long does it usually take? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anywhere from 5 seconds to 5 hours.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: depends on if it uses molecules that are familar or not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might not be able to replicate some things, but if you need to, you can force a "most close fit"</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, it says it's done, but it also says "10 errors found". ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah, it does that when its an item that doesn't follow standard physics</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: aka magic items</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm gonna see what it does when I try to replicate from the scan data. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaaand, it replicated an empty jar. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: great. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you sure there isn't any stuff at the bottom?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me check... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((the numbers are primarily energy-based, what would that do?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( is there any matter in the numbers at all? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((probably not))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I was going to say if so, the bottom of the jar would be filled with dust. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( so yeah, its empty then. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((ah, okay then))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I shook the thing, it's pretty darn empty. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: can't replicate numbers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Jars seem to be fine though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was worth a shot. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, it gave us valuable information.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if it worked perfectly, we wouldn't have learned anything about the numbers, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so anything else you wanna try to replicate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm starting to think I should save some filespace on the Ring Server for replicator information.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: password protected, but there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That way all of our replicators will be linked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that sound like a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (fucking enterkey)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((back from lunch))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *be useful ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I'll work on it when I get back to normal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...since I don't wanna be anywhere around the mountain at this size.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: o_o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, don't want to get eaten by anything. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah, could I have something to defend myself with soon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe not the toothpick, someone might see it and not me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at least, knowing /my/ luck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which Kimura said was pretty bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (course he later said it was broken so I don't know)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...idea!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what is it this time ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There might be a few drops of the potion left over.</span><br />
