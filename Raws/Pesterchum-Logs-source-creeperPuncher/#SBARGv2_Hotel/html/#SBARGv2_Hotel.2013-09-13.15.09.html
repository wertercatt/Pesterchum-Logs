<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Holy fuck/!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Teach me how!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its not going to last long, so just... look at it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, if you put lightning through flame, you get that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What, really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … /how do I make lightning/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plasma is ionized gas... I can teach you to make that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yes good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but... nuclear fusion and fission... no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: now, plasma can be contained with magnetic fields, like the one this ring is making... if I were to turn it off...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stands the fuck back... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, it would expand rapidly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I won't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … so will you teach me how to make magic liquid fire and suns?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... thats kinda the outside part of a sun...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can teach you that... but the heart of a sun... thats too dangerous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't be silly, it's one of the last things a red mage learns.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like black mages don't get to use the dimension circles proper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and does a red mage learn to know when to /stop/ before that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey! Discipline is a very important part of mage training!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Burn one person you loved to a charred, smoking corpse, and you're pretty much guaranteed to never do it again!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and what if you accidently burn a city?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: a /planet/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, don't worry. Usually we have our powers under control by the time we're like, nine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: yeah im just going to keep backing up</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not a red mage... I don't know how you were taught this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: infact, I would say this would be a rather different method than what a red mage would use...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I knew anything at all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just seems...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this isn't just normal fire manipulation...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this leads further on a cosmic scale...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Well, I woke up one day with my bed on fire, and then Father apprenticed me to Master Oshin. It's about that simple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … how the cosmic whatsit, though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, there are 3 states of matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, there is a fourth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /Plasma/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is like... an ionized gas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: everything in the universe is made out of... little circles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, if I ran an electrical charge through water, a liquid, I could seperate it into two gasses...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: circles? huh... interesting...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, these circles bind together to make the objects we know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plasma is when you bounce even tinyer circles off and onto those circles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its an Ionized gas...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where electricity is flowing through it... however, heat is also required...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: otherwise, the circles can't move fast enough to become like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: these circles are made up of even tiner circles, which move so fast they basically are everywhere around that circle...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and those tiny tiny circles... are made up of tiny tiny tiny /tiny/ so tiny you couldn't even imagine, strings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that are literally the thinest thing possible...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they are one dimentional... and yet, go into 11 different dimentions...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which ones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, you could say this sphere right here is three dimentional...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  points at the plasma ball --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and text on a piece of paper would be two...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: those are /spacial/ dimentions... not alternate universes like you know of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: strings would be like a straight line... with only length, no width or height...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at such a small level... things get... weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how do you get... eight more, though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...imagine branching a line off of a straight line... turning one dimention into two... then branching off of the paper into the air to make three...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: going further would be branching past the spacetime we exist in...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the /way/ those dimentions are also control the laws of physics and the conditions in universes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Magic works at the quantum level, ignoring all of those pesky laws of physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you can literally create energy out of nothing with magic...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Which story?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: storY, eveN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Where'd you come from, how'd you wind up here, what've you done in between those events, how many dimensions are you wanted in, how can you dimension travel? That sort of thing.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Fun times. What was your dimension like? Your home one, I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Oh, it was pretty average, I guess. Well. I haven't seen many, save the ones I've learned of since getting here. It was governed by these tiny building blocks, and a ever present force that linked them all together.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently, that name is dangerous or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And I'd rather not meet him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: How about you? What was it like? I know time is funky here, switching dimensions... It's like, after I left mine, I was looking at it from the outside and I saw what was going to happen, everything that could happen...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: See, the thing is, Pazuzu is a demon spirit, but he's a good demon spirit</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: All he does is bring hard times, like dry weather, wet weather, pests...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Lamashtu is worse. She kills babies. Like. In the womb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE:  So don't say that name if you're pregnant. I'm sorry for saying it. If any of you are preggoS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Elderra, a mage dimension. I awakened my powers as a red mage early on, so was apprenticed to Master Oshin. The Mage Wars… I don't even know how they started. Master kept me sheltered from that, said I needed to focus on my studies. His tower was one of the last to fall-- as they, whoever they were, were breaching his last line of defences, he summoned the demon Caliban.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Instead of saving himself, he told Caliban to take me and run. I spent a bit in the demon dimension, or one of 'em. Then was kicked to Deva, where I nicked a d-hopper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've been dimension hopping ever since, jumping to a new one whenever the old one stops being so friendly towards me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've picked up a /lot/ on the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And nope, not preggos here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Caliban was a cool dude? How are the demons there? And dimension hopping sounds awesomE. Bring me sometimE!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: First I need to find out what I can actually DO here. On my world, in my dimension, I wasn't good for mucH. But since I can slip out of my own dimension and wind up... Here, wherever it is, I can probably do some cool stufF...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: He knew my mentor, at least. Something went down between them in the past. I, uh, tried not to go out much. Y'know, being Elderran and all. And not a demon. Although I'm considered one in several dimensions. I might hop back to Deva if I can get this blasted thing working with an object anchor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I need to pick up supplies before I run out!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Red magic is the only type that comes /naturally/, and even then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: I really wish I had some of my geaR. I didn't get to bring anything with mE. I kinda got dumped herE... And I'm pretty good with tech, I'd like to take a look at this 'D-hopper' some time if you would let mE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I keep my stuff in a transdimensional storage pocket I bought a few dimensions back. *she pulls out a small cylindrical device with a button on one end and five dials, which are marked with strange symbols she can't understand*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But yeah, you can take a look.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: *He'd gently grasp it with his thumb and forefinger, raising it up to inspect the symbols.* So, five symbolS, five parameteS. I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say it's related to five dimensions of space-timE? Distance from the creation point of the dimension in the x, y, and z axiS. TimE. Aaaand... This fifth one... It's significant, it's symbol looks more complicateD. Do the symbols change</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">spin the dialS? This really has my brain workiN'...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I have no idea what you just said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Neither do I.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay, what you do, is you spin the spinny wheels through all their symbols, stop on five you want to go to, and do absolutely nothing with it because /it's mine/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ahem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: *HAnds it back over to her and shrugs his shoulders* Fine, finE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *transdimensionally pockets it again* Hey, it took quite a bit of trouble to steal this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: You don't always know /where/ you're going to go though, do yoU? That can be a problem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, I have no idea where I'm going, ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I only use it when I need to escape, /fast/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And it takes foreeever to recharge enough to let me do it again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Well, see, that's why I'm trying to look at it, so you can maybe not warp somewhere dangerous like next to a black hole or in Michael Jackson's housE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I have no idea how I even got here, let alone how to get home. even if there were the right kind of mirror here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((wow. you went there. ...then again, that house probably IS a Euclid-level SCP at the very least.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I was running from a mob. Again. So I hopped and wound up with a Void monster that wanted to consume me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Yeaaaah seE? That's bad, m'kaY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nah, it consumed me and I wound up here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: OH! Well that's gooD. I guesS. M'kay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I just sort of go with the flow and try to learn as much magic as possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Well, I highly sugest you get that jawn appraised or something, 'cuz if you find an instruction booklet for it you're gonna like rule the multiverse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can't read the doohickey. And… why would I do that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Uh, you don't have to rule, I'm just saying you coulD. What I really mean is you could pretty much do whatever you wanT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, yeah, if it didn't take so damn long to recharge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Well I mean if you can go anywhere anywhen, you can make sure it's somewhere you'll have time to wait!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, I guess. Mostly I just want to get back to the Devan Bazaar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can get so much stuff there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: What is this Devan placE? Some sort of super advanced racE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Deva. I think it's like an interdimensional trade centre.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Well that should have a like a preset or somethinG! Look, if it's important, we find a book on it in the library, no probleM. See if it's got a symbol or something as it's call sign. Find it turning them knobbies and you're on your waY! Easy like Sunday morninG!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *stares at him blankly* Not all dimensions even know about other dimensions, let alone Deva.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Well have you checked to see if there's any information in this dimension on other dimensionS? If you haven't looked yet, you're not trying very harD! </span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've been staying in the library. Haven't found anything on Deva, though.</span><br />
