<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey Kimura.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I just love that many peoples train of thoughts go- Oh heya CP!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was just telling Hannah about the weapons test yesterday.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might have left out the bit about me having to yell at PO to get the hell out of the blast radius.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But yeah its like... "I don't know what to do with this" ---&gt; "Let's see what happens if we blow it up."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering I made it as a weapon because I was bored, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh. You shouldnt have many chances to use it now, thankfully.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah I'm just going Mythbusters tier crazy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Unless the main problems can be solved by explosions, then idonno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, not everything can be solved with explosives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just the majority of stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And sometimes that isn't the best solution.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Shocking, I know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ((~time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( oh wait the bot isn't on ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((snrk))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I also brought up the subject about how Immortality is going to suck big time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so assume you have a consort friend, that lives to about, say, 50.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Aaaah, right. The main problem: Not everyone can be ageless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eventually, if you stay friends with the family, his great great great great great grandson is going to find a picture of you and the first consort friend, and ask about it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I came up with a slight solution, but Alex said it was a bad idea... considering he kinda did it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm? What now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Every 200 years or so, we would wipe portions of our memories...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uuuuuh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I figure thats gonna be mandatory anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since the human brain is not infinite in its capacity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah I agree with Alex. - Eeeeh, It'll happen on its own time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So uh, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been trying to figure out the code for a Pensieve.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ? Why so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I... don't wanna forget everything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: oh derf. Right. That thing. Forgot what is was for a second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that some memories will eventually fade, but other than transhumanism as a solution, thats likely what I'm going to have to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL, then you face the problem with keeping anything important in only one place: You have the risk of loosing all of it suddenly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Are you suggesting we put our memories on... some sort of cloud server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hey..</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No! I'm saying that the system you are suggesting is quite odd! -Oh heya TT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...EQ, how much should I trust a denizen of a dead land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... Well, it depends on the denizen. </span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ??</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Just like people, some you can just trust and some you cant. Dead-land denizens don't have much to do with their time, normally... so I'm not sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Basically: Meet face-to-face. The denizen loves things like chaos, treachery, and sadness... don't trust it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: She often tries to be gentle, but considering her size and strength, that doesn't really work out too well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -That rule goes for anything living, basically.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah, okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I don't think either me or PK really like the accidental haircuts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Can't really tussle hair with talons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Um... okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which dead-land denizen is this again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Phoenix, denizen of the Land of Flame and Spirit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ah, the one that was visiting the memo the other day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one whos room on one of the evac ships got toilet papered by a single consort.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm disappointed in him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...remember when we all did that silly color quiz?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was worded in such a way that it would be painfully accurate for everyone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the color quiz did jack shit for me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either it was broken, or I was doing it /very/ wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ehh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 's how those quizzes work: They write it in a way so everything can apply to almost anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats what was said back then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: AKA exactly how fortune cookies work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I ate at a consort place once where they gave out fortune cookies at the end.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mine was blank.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Printing mistake, I would assume.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ........yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay, don't tell me you are even slightly worried about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well I'm not /anymore/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just the timing was terrifying in hindsight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Good, then! You should have more sense than to worry over a peice of paper that was stuffed in a cookie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and eh fair enough I suppose.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it was when I had the countdown going on my watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah... okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">COD</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://xkcd.com/969/'>http://xkcd.com/969/</a> what</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess its like the air being sucked off earth with the portal on the moon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Only with water.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: pft</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: man, what if stargates didn't have the thing blocking water flow through it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it would've /ruined/ the russian base that one episode...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or they could have just shut off the gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not like water is a black hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus you know, other than radio signals, stargates are one way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: true... but the gate won't shut down if something's in transit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes it will.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I mean dialing in /from/ the water planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, they managed to cut off the dudes head in like, the second episode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meh, guess you're right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, wouldn't the massive amount of water be counted as a single object?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And not go through like the people in the front of the puddle jumper in that one episode?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think that only applies to solid objects...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, this. <a href='https://xkcd.com/571/'>https://xkcd.com/571/</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If that were the case, people would be going through with out the fluids in their body.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...why am I trying to discuss this when doctor who is distacting me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because science fiction discussion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That is basically science fact now due to alchemiters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Think someone could alchemize a TARDIS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DAMMIT</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't have that much grist!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: woah what</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me just count the number of zeros...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It's a thing you can make? Seriously?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...dammit, I lost count at 50.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I mean it shouldnt surprise me, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I estimate that there are 100 zeros in the grist cost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, roughly 2^256 grist? of every type, or just some?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just Zillium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........how the /fuck/</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: For... people with a lot of time to somehow aquire that much zillium? I guess?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's... kinda-sorta impossible for non-tricksters to get that much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I had to use the Laser Station to read the code, too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: by the way, how many zeroes in "One Zillion"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 0.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just the game fucking with you, items that cost one zillion grist cost 1 of that grist type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, I doubt anyone could get 1 googol of Zillium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless they were lords of time itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I wanted to get that much grist, it would require a fuckton of doomed timelines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since while people can be doomed, information and objects are... different.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As such, Grist can't really be doomed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its also interesting that Grist does not collide with itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you'd have to do the repeatedly-killing-same-enemies thing from Dave: Accelerate... /while in trickster mode/ so all grist dropped is zillium</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, if you are in a doomed timeline, get a space hero to shrink a planet and recycle it in the past.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sounds exactly like something a trickster would do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: remind me to NEVER LET YOU GO TRICKSTER.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...or let /myself/ go trickster, for that matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh please, my tricksterness is only limited to when I am laying in a magic beanbag.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: remember that beanbag?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh riiiight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So um, Kimura.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How much did you watch/play super mario 64.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the original? haven't. but I've played the DS remake several times, all the way through. why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so you know that one section that leads to the door submerged in the water outside of the castle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In peaches castle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the basement area?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I... wouldn't fall in that section.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Trust me about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: where you ground-pound the pillars?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I fell in there... /I/ wouldn't come back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think that details enough about what is leaking into that area.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you seen the... fourth episode of stargate atlantis?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was titled "Thirty-Eight Minutes"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just... replace the gate and the puddle jumper with two other things and it seems to fit perfectly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...not sure if I want to know how that analogy works in this case.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I think the magicant is... slowly sinking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, weirdness I just realized. we were talking about transhumanism earlier, and right now a cyberman episode is on ("Nightmare in Silver", to be specific)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........sinking into where?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember how I welded that door since it lead into the blue door?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: blue hole*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeaaaah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, it's sinking into /that/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aaaaaand since the Magicant isn't technically local to a specific session........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its even more important that we destroy the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. if we don't, it'll start eating sessions via the magicant before it even gets out to them on this side.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah. Plus, it might... oh dear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nevermind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets /not/ worry about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: don't know don't want to know just fuck that shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Tea Kettle, Bonfire, Dry Ice, Flaming Snake, and some sort of Flaming Angel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, question. going back to the thing earlier about our brains running out of free space after a couple centuries... what about those of us who are partially nonhuman? would we be affected differently?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: flaming angel /what/</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to come up with pokemon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Flaming Angel, a Fire/Fairy type would likely a legendary.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to fill out the non existant type combos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh. The Name of the Doctor is on right now, and this first part with the "conference call" is /totally/ a freakin' dreambubble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm, maybe I should fill out the fairy type with fakemon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fairy/Dragon is gonna be a Helium Dragon that evolves into a Balloon Animal Eastern style dragon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fire/Fairy is going to be A legendary angel pokemon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While Fairy/Dark could be some sort of... fallen angel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SATAN</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: wha</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Legendary Fallen Angel Pokemon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: don'τ we already have a pokesaτan</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: also noτ all fairies are "good"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... We already have a pokesatan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it could just be Blue/Orange mortality.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or maybe more of... Law and Chaos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know a Poison/Fairy pokemon will have to know Draining Kiss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Fire/Fairy Legendary would be a powerful pokemon, with high special attack and normal attack, but not much to defense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where as the Dark/Fairy would be more defensive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps a Sun/Moon theme would be appropriate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be an excuse to give the Fire/Fairy Solar Beam and sunny day, where as the Dark/Fairy would get Moonlight and Moonblast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Bug, and Ghost...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I came up with a decent name for the Fire/Fairy legendary.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  Baskira.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I should have been waτching Rozen Maiden buτ I end up waτching someone playing pepsiman</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ am I doing wiτh my life</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Everything and nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Baskira and Divurum</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sounds like decent legendary names.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far, I have 5 Pokemon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With names that is.</span><br />

A kettle fish<br />
DS: a teapot with fins<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its a cuttlefish inside of a teapot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And its a Fire/Water type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about... Gelufaux?</span><br />
DS: is fire/water even a thing<br />
Ditto<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what.</span><br />
*DS: ditto<br />

DS: well gel, and the faux, which means fake<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, what does gelu mean?</span><br />
I was thinking just Gel, like gelatinous<br />
*DS:<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its solid.</span><br />
DS: so is ditto<br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so FL, I reread the log I missed because of the episode... why the hell were you thinking the lands were gonna deorbit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i mean a beta enemy is no big shock, but why would there be a single one placed under the floor, only in mission 8?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I see what you did there))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I was watching that Majora's Mask game theory.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i dont))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((no big shock))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And well, thinking about the effects of earth being thrown of orbit, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: jesus fucking christ fl stop watching shitty gaming videos</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((:b))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured that maybe meteors passing by could have an effect on the orbit of the lands, but I stupidly used normal physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have no clue what is going to happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((also cp theres this disturbing unused pollution map: <a href='http://tcrf.net/images/a/a4/SMSpollution.png'>http://tcrf.net/images/a/a4/SMSpollution.png</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((it would have been layered over a level to show where the pollution is))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((pfft))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... I'm not sure the incipisphere even COULD run on normal orbital physics, really. like with the 27 planets in the Medusa Cascade, they /can't/ orbit that close without assistance (or just not using regular physics to begin with)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((the entirely underwater portion of noki bay has a used pollution map, but its washed away immediately by the ocean: <a href='http://tcrf.net/images/e/ea/SMSmaresea.png'>http://tcrf.net/images/e/ea/SMSmaresea.png</a> ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((which means idiot))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...not sure if your serious or not. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((fitting, since it gets washed away instantly))</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hahaha you dont get most pokemon origins do you</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: clean it up and it would totally fit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: as long as you keep the fucked-up-centaur body plan</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that works too</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It could be a skeletal centaur legendary.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((ooh, nsmb has an unused setting for ? blocks where it has a mushroom if mario is small and a coin otherwise))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: or just like a fucked-up centaur with green-and-purple swirly skin</span><br />
