<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think Hotel events might predict the future</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: has anyone heard of that one thing where a person alone is more likely to call 911 in an emergency than a large group?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I forgot the actual term for it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, the Somebody Else's Problem effect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: bystander effect</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its actually better in an emergency to call someone by name</span><br />
