[06:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((btw FL, -- CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP] reaches through a tiny brush portal and pawbonks FL as he leaves -- :P ))</span><br />
[06:02] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: Shut up</span><br />
[06:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what?</span><br />
[06:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why should I shut up?</span><br />
[06:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was just mentioning how the Tower of Ash was disappointing, thats all.</span><br />
[06:04] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: oh</span><br />
[06:04] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: Thought you were fering to where I am</span><br />
[06:04] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: because the new areas are really fun</span><br />
[06:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I've never been there.</span><br />
[06:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, it seemed more like it was actually suited to you, since the point's supposed to be about self-reflection...</span><br />
[06:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, I know how I managed to break it somehow... not even sure how I did that.</span><br />
[06:05] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: what</span><br />
[06:06] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: CP what are you talking about. This dungeon adapts to the party. Like all of the dungeons on my planet</span><br />
[06:06] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: hey wanna hear about my quest</span><br />
[06:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still talking about Tower of Ash...</span><br />
[06:06] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: derr</span><br />
[06:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well</span><br />
[06:06] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: Tottaly TT</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then I guess it didn't fucking work.</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#78120b">CDS: ooooooooooooooh shit</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">and oh riiiiiiiight, I have to do this now &gt;_&gt;</span></span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me adjust my scord for the tower.</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#78120b">CDS: hes saying youre dissapointing, FL</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...really?</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where?</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#78120b">CDS: CCP: actually, it seemed more like it was actually suited to you, since the point's supposed to be about self-reflection... </span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#78120b">CDS: you said it was dissapointing</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#78120b">CDS: ...nevermind</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  facepaws --</span><br />
[06:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">not what I meant</span></span><br />
[06:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah I just...</span><br />
[06:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DS, projecting much?</span><br />
[06:09] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: well apparently there are 12 planets that i have to investigate, each planet corrosponding with the 12 aspects, and i have to find artifacts in or on them somewhere</span><br />
[06:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">I meant, the concept of Tower of Ash seemed suited to /you being a Heart Player/</span></span><br />
[06:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sounds more like a shitty dungeon I'll be letting you guys handle since all its been doing to me is making my think that whoever designed that dungeon basically couldn't adapt to what the players threw at it.</span><br />
[06:11] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: huh sounds funner then calliborn's TT</span><br />
[06:11] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: Im guessing finishing the quest sucks you into the auctual session</span><br />
[06:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doubt it</span><br />
[06:11] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: ya his seems to have been built on destruction</span><br />
[06:12] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: idk the end result</span><br />
[06:14] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: me neither</span><br />
[06:14] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: I mean i'd have to timejump far forward to figure it out</span><br />
[06:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">well, according to Aranea's infodump, all Dead Sessions are like Caliborn's, with the Choice of ultimate power or sacrificing yourself to stop someone with ultimate power.</span></span><br />
[06:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well</span><br />
[06:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Caliborn was the only example</span><br />
[06:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and Aranea thought she could undoom a x5 doomed timeline loop</span><br />
[06:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">eh, true.</span></span><br />
[06:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically Aranea doesn't know /shit/</span><br />
[06:16] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: and also that is infering that im in a "Dead" session </span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well</span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: we never know</span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You do seem to be.</span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: well what is a Dead Session exactly</span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#005500">TT, if you're the only player there, by definition it's a Dead Session.</span></span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: Espically if your not even time or space</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: hm well true</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: but the reason for this dead session might be different</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We don't know much about dead sessions...</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I know for a fact you won't be able to make a universe.</span><br />
[06:19] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: ya but any ways i started on the planet of hope or better known as the Land of Hope and Heat</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: anyway im going to go tackle the best dungeon ever</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: Kid Radd dungeon For the win</span><br />

[06:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like</span><br />
[06:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how does that even work</span><br />
[06:25] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: I'd need a BRING</span><br />
[06:25] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: and i dont have any on me</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay then</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll fly</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_Kid'>#SBARGv2_Kid</a> Radd) ))</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: might come over once this tower's over...</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is it an open dungeon?</span><br />
[06:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_LoCaL'>#SBARGv2_LoCaL</a> lets do this. ))</span><br />
[06:27] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: yeah</span><br />
[06:27] <span style="color:#ff0000">CTT: so can i listen in on your dungeon adventures</span><br />
[06:27] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: sure</span><br />
[06:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: depends on how much we share</span><br />
[06:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually FL, we might need your help after all. I think DS just got his Heart eaten.</span><br />
[06:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Too bad.</span><br />
[06:28] <span style="color:#aa007f">?PK: he can deal</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … that sounds bad.</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh.</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#78120b">CDS: ((DS will most likely get his soul restored after his denizen fight))</span><br />
