[03:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I find that really hard to believe ➜</span><br />
[03:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well okay I guess I could swallow a Splash Damage but the water would vanish before it could help</span><br />
[03:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[03:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus the fact it would likely rip me open</span><br />
[03:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dry throat or something?</span><br />
[03:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, I /might/ have gone too far away from the village.</span><br />
[03:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell me, how far away is the nearest desert?</span><br />
[03:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no idea</span><br />

[03:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: fair enough. ➜</span><br />
[03:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, not taking shortcuts. you ARE learning for once.</span><br />
[03:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (tbh, I had to learn the same lesson fro PA during my first firebending lesson; I tried flying up the mountain and she told me to walk instead)</span><br />

[03:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However if I do flare into the bar, in that case you should /maybe/ get me some medical attention.</span><br />
[03:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've decided to only use my powers incase of emergency.</span><br />
[03:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, can you send some coordinates? ➜</span><br />
[03:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no.</span><br />

[03:09] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I... need to do this myself.</span><br />
[03:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which directiondid you leave the village from? Do you remember that? ➜</span><br />
[03:11] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Um... South. Definately south.</span><br />
[03:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, /after/ you get back, could you then give the coordinates? the desert might be interesting to check out.</span><br />
[03:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright then. ➜</span><br />
[03:11] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And I went in a bunch of circles in the forest</span><br />
[03:11] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: and kinda went randomly</span><br />
[03:12] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...Oh thank god an oasi- SON OF A BITCH</span><br />
[03:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you familiar with the sundial compass technique? (wait, does that even work on starter?) ➜</span><br />
[03:13] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I have a compass...</span><br />
[03:13] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Hold on, let me figure out how far south I am.</span><br />
[03:16] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( I think we should adjust the map so it fits a planetary scale))</span><br />
[03:16] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Just saying ))</span><br />
[03:16] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Cause that city is /fucking massive/ ))</span><br />
[03:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah...............))</span><br />
[03:17] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( And if you look at the size of a land compared to johns house, the land is only the size of a large city at /most/. ))</span><br />
[03:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((why does so many things go wrong when I say yes to things...))</span><br />
[03:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((do I even deserve to do anything here if I can't even properly discern between what others want and what the group will accept...))</span><br />
[03:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((then again, it's not like anyone even wants to step up and take the position I've been shafted with.))</span><br />

[03:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and I'm not even sure if anyone is even qualified in the slightest))</span><br />
[03:21] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((why are you shutting up when you have a validpoint?))</span><br />
[03:21] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Because its making you feel bad, and thats bad. ))</span><br />
[03:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I shouldn't be spared for the sake of feeling better, there's more important things to focus on, like this RP's reputation which I've repeatedly tarnished by letting others do what they want))</span><br />
[03:22] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Okay, the Radius of the Land of wind and shade is 80 house widths ))</span><br />
[03:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((all because I barely know what I'm doing when it comes to limiting people with ideas))</span><br />
[03:23] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( VS, how much of LoCaN did you bring? (sorry if you aren't the one I can't remember anything anymore) ))</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( She brought in a small chunk of it. I had drawn it on a map ))</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( i think i still have the map somewhere hold on ))</span><br />
[03:24] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Like, percentage of surface area of the land? ))</span><br />

[03:24] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Yeah, thats just the issue there ))</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...I think the problem is, when you drew the outline of Neon, you drew it assuming Starter was the size of a Land and not an actual full-blown planet...))</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( its still a sizable chunk ))</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Even if you brought the /entire land/, it would only be about a few pixels area in size surface area wise compared to starter. ))</span><br />
[03:25] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( really? ))</span><br />
[03:26] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( well shoot ))</span><br />
[03:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((didn't we decide on a 10km diameter as a general rule of thumb for Land sizes, back when LoSaCrossroads had a giant crater made in the south pole?))</span><br />
[03:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((or something around there?))</span><br />
[03:27] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( 45 feet for a house size... let me convert to meters... ))</span><br />
[03:27] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Okay, lets assume 13 meters. ))</span><br />
[03:28] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Which would make the radius of a planet about... a single kilometer o_o ))</span><br />
[03:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...what.))</span><br />
[03:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((wat))</span><br />
[03:28] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( I was comparing LoWaS to Johns house. ))</span><br />
[03:29] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Which is 80 x 3 pixels in radius. ))</span><br />
[03:29] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( 3 pixels being the visible width of johns house. ))</span><br />
[03:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((honestly, I think John's house was shown that big so that it could actually be visible on-screen))</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah, probably.))</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Then should I go off of the size of the Beat Mesa on Dave's land? ))</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((let's just say 10km diameter, because it's a nice round number in between "Mario Galaxy baby planet" and "motherfucking Couresant"))</span><br />
[03:31] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( Alright, that actually works. ))</span><br />
[03:32] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( The square kilometers an /entire land/ takes up is 314 km^2 ))</span><br />
[03:34] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( which is less than half the areqa of new york city. ))</span><br />
[03:34] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( And since its only a sizable chunk of the planet, we could divide that area by say... 64. ))</span><br />
[03:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...by the way, how big is Manhattan Island by itself? because when I think NYC, that's the only part that I actually visualize...))</span><br />

[03:36] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( I guess so ))</span><br />
[03:37] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: (( I mean, we /could/ bump it up to 10 so its still a sizable city ))</span><br />
