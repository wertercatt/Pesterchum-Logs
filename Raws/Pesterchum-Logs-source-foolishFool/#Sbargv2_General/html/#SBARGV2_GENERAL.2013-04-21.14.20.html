<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Huh, cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: now do you want the more complex version\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the power of the emoti is dependent on three things: years lived by the being's whose heart became the emoti, the emotions the being felt, and the intentsy of the emotions felt. all these determ the power of the emoti.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the emoti's color can give hints to the type of magic that can be used from a certain emoti\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: And a emoti of certain strenght can contain the memories of the being that the emoti came from.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: can those memories somehow be read?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the memories come included with the personally that belonged to them\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: :'D</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so yes the memories can be transfered from the emoti to the weilder via mind melding of the controller to the emoti\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: would the emoti refuse to transfer sensitive information in the case they're sapient?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yes\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: can the emoti lie?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: wait what are we talking about</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: they can still make their own choices of which infromation to give\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0037ff">CAE: or at least lie through omission, like scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and yes emotis that can transfer knowledge can lie\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: they can flat out lie if it suits the personally of the being of the emoti\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: though terrible liers in life would still be terrible lies as emoti\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: what's an emoti</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: iut's from the story i'm working on\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: though I must add some emoti would like to transfer their mind to their host in order to take over their mind\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: that is actually a major part of the story i'm working on.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: what do you guys think?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: its interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i've put a lot of thought into the mechanics of how the emoti would work\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I like it</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: since they are A. completely new as far as I know and B. a major part of the story\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: thank you Nv\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: though i need to figure out what monsters to use and which ones would be intelligent enough to from emoti.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *form\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What do you mean by completely new, the concept being new?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well maybe not the concept but the way they are made and how they are actived to use\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It sounds like it could be a Phylactery from D&amp;D lore </span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i mean magical gemstones are a thing but how many stories have you heard where they are fromed of peoples hearts?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Phylactery? I haven't played D&amp;D.\l/</span><br />
