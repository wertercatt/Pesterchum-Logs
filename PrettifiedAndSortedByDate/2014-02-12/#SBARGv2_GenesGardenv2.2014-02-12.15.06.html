[03:06:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks down the stairs, palm applied directly to the forehead. --</span><br />
[03:13:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need a fucking drink.</span><br />
[03:13:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:13:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you okay?</span><br />
[03:13:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or, going to be?</span><br />
[03:14:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Depends on if people decide to punish me.</span><br />
[03:15:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I guess I'm frightened of that.</span><br />
[03:16:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well okay, let's go about this in a logical way. your pseudoexile said you were /planning/ to sabotage the engines. were you, and did you?</span><br />
[03:17:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I'm obviously going to deny both. Thats what everyone would expect me to do.</span><br />
[03:18:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I was planning on doing it, that message would basically prevent me from going through with it.</span><br />
[03:18:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...this is true.</span><br />
[03:19:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, different kind of question: assuming you did or were going to, is he right about the motive, to keep us Starterbound?</span><br />
[03:19:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#baba00">CURRENT atomicEagle [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:19:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#baba00">[CAE]</span>  voids in a shot of vodka --</span><br />
[03:19:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I wouldn't want to kill anyone, so I guess if anything, it might be to prevent you from leaving, yes.</span><br />
[03:20:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  chugs the shot. --</span><br />

[03:20:28] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  comes down stairs, abrushing her hair and appearing a bit cheerful --</span><br />
[03:20:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess the only way to check for sure would be to scan the ship for anything of the explodey variety...</span><br />
[03:22:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That could actually be pulled off a large amount of ways, one of them could be damaging the engine so it selfdestructs, or rigging an explosive to go off when someone activates the ignition.</span><br />
[03:22:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, if its anything like a car, there has to be an ignition.</span><br />
[03:23:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  sighs and sits down at the bar --</span><br />

[03:23:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Psuedoexile said I was gonna blow up the ship apparently.</span><br />
[03:23:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I read it on tumblr.</span><br />
[03:24:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and while I'm capable of deleting it, it would only cause more suspicion.</span><br />
[03:24:31] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: that is true</span><br />
[03:24:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: destroying the evidence, as it is put.</span><br />
[03:25:20] <span style="color:#722881">CAS: wow...you're sounding pretty sane today *yawns a bit*</span><br />
[03:26:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, if I couldn't get caught, it would be a rather smart plan, blow up the ship, hack into the camera records and delete them with the uplink shit...</span><br />
[03:27:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or better yet, loop a section of video memory so it appears noone walked in.</span><br />

[03:27:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then warp out with a flare.</span><br />
[03:29:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I don't think national treasure was the same, but similar concept.</span><br />
[03:29:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: with the footage-loop I mean</span><br />
[03:30:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...must of missed that part</span><br />
