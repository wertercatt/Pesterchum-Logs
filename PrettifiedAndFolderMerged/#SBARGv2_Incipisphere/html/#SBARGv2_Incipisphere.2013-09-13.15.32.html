[04:34:12] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Although living in catatonia can cause brain damage over time, and that can result in death.</span><br />
[04:34:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...quick question, do you think chronos needs to eat?</span><br />
[04:34:41] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: But there are reports of people living for years in a coma, and coming out normal, if not a bit confused.</span><br />
[04:34:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: do god tiers even need to eat?</span><br />
[04:34:53] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: I'm sure he does need to...</span><br />
[04:35:17] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: But uhh... I'm sure if he gets hungry he can just HACK his hunger away.</span><br />
[04:35:43] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: The blasted cheater.</span><br />
[04:35:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or rewind the inside of his stomach.</span><br />
[04:35:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /paradox food/</span><br />
[04:35:58] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: To a point it was full</span><br />
[04:36:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and that brings me back to the question of what paradox slime tastes like.</span><br />
[04:36:28] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Or hell, even just move food from one point in paradox space to his stomach.</span><br />
[04:36:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ugh.</span><br />
[04:36:47] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Probably similar to Sopor Slime</span><br />
[04:36:56] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Whatever that is</span><br />
[04:37:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, you read that theory too?</span><br />
[04:37:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /best theory/</span><br />
[04:37:24] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: What theory&gt;</span><br />
[04:37:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that apparently the reason Gamzee is pseudo-immortal despite not actually being tiered because he ate so much sopor which might be paradox slime</span><br />
[04:37:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: liquid stem cells basically</span><br />
[04:38:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and since paradox slime is basically life-giving goo or can be interpreted as such</span><br />
[04:38:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that</span><br />
[04:38:27] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: ((I think that would be considered OOC... or does Homestuck webcomic exist in this universe?))</span><br />
[04:38:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( yes ))</span><br />
[04:38:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it does exist))</span><br />
[04:38:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( it does ))</span><br />
[04:39:00] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: ((Okay))</span><br />
[04:39:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( seriously this session is meta to the point that the first guardian reads it ))</span><br />
[04:39:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( and may possibly have a fear of angels like everyone else now. ))</span><br />
[04:40:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((though that fear of angels thing and shooting down your land quest idea, that whole convo yesterday was in fact OOC...))</span><br />

[04:47:34] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: and this Session started on 4/12/13. /Five months/ l8r and we're still getting a metric fuckton of newbs who don't know a goddamn thing and can't even have been arsed to join up with us.</span><br />
[04:47:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *3/12/13</span><br />
[04:47:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Right, March is the third month.</span><br />
[04:47:56] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: CP, Don't antagonize</span><br />
[04:47:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit... that glitch is the only way to explain that.</span><br />
[04:48:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /that's even worse/.</span><br />
[04:48:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No! Everything can't be handwaved with "a glitch"! Aaaaaagh I hate this.</span><br />

[04:48:31] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: Hello powerKitten, are doing well?</span><br />
[04:48:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then explain how Dirk and Roxy's houses appeared near the same time in session as Jane and Jake?</span><br />
[04:49:00] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Well, considering the glitches are pretty prevalent in our session, most things can be handwaved with a glitch.</span><br />
[04:49:14] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: As for your inane comment about "still getting Noobs"</span><br />
[04:49:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a bug, its a /feature/!</span><br />
[04:49:26] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: As a noob, you can fuck off with that shit.</span><br />
[04:50:04] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And they all started the Game at around the same time frame for all of them. Yes, they were four hundred years apart, but even so, they were all still talking to each other, and all appeared in the Medium at the same Medium-time.</span><br />
[04:50:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also fyi: I'm planning to do that trip back into Fahr Caverns on Tuesday, hopefully...</span><br />
[04:50:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright</span><br />
[04:50:24] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: im sorry said anything</span><br />
[04:50:26] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: ...</span><br />
[04:50:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
[04:50:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and what happens to skaia if it tries to morph while morphing?</span><br />
[04:50:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: in afk standard time, they're all the same time.</span><br />
[04:50:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /feature/ not bug</span><br />
[04:51:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Does this mean that our goddamn Battlefield isn't finished?</span><br />
[04:51:08] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Gambit, good job you made teh Noob cryy :3</span><br />
[04:51:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because all these fucktards have "just entered"?</span><br />
[04:51:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or atleast a safety precausion</span><br />
[04:51:16] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: As for the actually intelligent question about Skaia.</span><br />
[04:51:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think so, yes</span><br />
[04:51:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And who knows how many more there will be.</span><br />
[04:51:38] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: It would finish aplying the first changes it had, then que the second one</span><br />
[04:51:50] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: It would continue in order basicallt.</span><br />
[04:51:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So we have to wait for every single person to join who's going to, despite the fact we can't predict their entries, in order for our field to finish and us to...</span><br />
[04:51:54] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Basically*</span><br />
[04:51:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... we have at /most/ 7 more months to wait</span><br />
[04:52:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ugh. Fuck it.</span><br />
[04:52:13] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 according to teh tehroy of delayed entry :3</span><br />
[04:52:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as with the time delay formula, that would be when people would /stop/ joining.</span><br />
[04:52:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 24 hours of meteors on earth.</span><br />
[04:52:49] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 until a year passes, teh BF isnt finished :3</span><br />
[04:53:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, a normal session requires all players to survive</span><br />
[04:53:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, here's the dumbest question in the history of Paradox Space... /why hasn't anyone just gone to Prospit or Derse and counted how many prototyping towers aren't lit yet/????????</span><br />
[04:53:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because overflow</span><br />
[04:54:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, that's not true. potential of a session to succeed is not dependent on all players surviving, only on all players prototyping something pre-entry.</span><br />
[04:54:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it sure helps to have players survive, but it's not an auto fail condition if they don't.</span><br />
[04:54:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: last time I checked... the towers were rings of light, not spheres like normal.</span><br />
[04:55:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: much like the rings</span><br />
[04:55:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp. fuck my plan then.</span><br />
[04:55:55] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: I prototyped a 1/4 full bottle of powerade preentry, was that smart?</span><br />
[04:56:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[04:56:20] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: or stupid</span><br />
[04:56:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so, what part of that will we see in underlings?</span><br />
[04:56:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's weird... but as long as you threw SOMETHING at the seizure kernal, ya good.</span><br />
[04:56:41] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: i figured protyping something thats weak will be helpful</span><br />
[04:56:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1/4th underlings, hyper underlings, or bottle underlings?</span><br />
[04:57:02] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: option 3</span><br />
[04:57:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or I should say, if my theory is right, something that is not a Perfectly Generic Object or thing with an unreadable captchacode, like a pumpkin or Sbarg disc.</span><br />
[04:57:21] <span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: Yeah, I prototyped a computer, and an anime girl poster giving me PCPron imps (To quote PK)</span><br />
[04:57:35] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Yeah :3</span><br />
[04:57:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually FLord said he prototyped a PGO last session... and he got a cube sprite.</span><br />
[04:58:04] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 I figure il extend teh offer to you, would you like to join my team SR? :3</span><br />
[04:58:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, guess my theory's wrong then about prototyping data determined by alchemically mashing together the objects in question...</span><br />
[04:59:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that, or a PGO just counts as not having affected the underlings in question, but still counts as "prototyped a thing" for battlefield purposes.</span><br />
[04:59:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: … Perfectly Generic Underlings.</span><br />
[04:59:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's what they are. Just compurrletely generic :3</span><br />
[05:00:37] <span style="color:#00ffff">CSR: In response to PK's offer: Sure why not</span><br />
[05:01:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually, considering that upon creation PGO's come in contact with oxygen and actually have a shape... I think it might make underlings... more generic?</span><br />
[05:01:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: more... blocky?</span><br />
[05:03:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL. you are trying to apply logic to a game that runs on the absence of it. please stahp.</span><br />
