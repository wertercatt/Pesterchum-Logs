<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh. It's something to talk about. What'da you wanna know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently there was this session before ours, a prescratch session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyway, they scratched in an attempt to kill the big bad, chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and now we have SBARGv2, which was a second session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We were brought in using the /power of pumpkins/ and we started playing, dooming the human race.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyway, thats when we learned that the session was riddled with bugs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: inorder to fix the bugs, the "guardian" asked us to do things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after a while, a few of us became suspicious of the guardian, around after the third gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We entered the fourth gate, and got some codes from our denizens, mostly meeting them for the first time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then apparently we ran out of pumpkins, so the "guardian" asked us to send in our sprites.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A few of us complied, I went with my Cruxite Buddy Sprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The battery that the sprites filled /exploded/ and the "guardian" turned out to be chronos in disguise. He destroyed all the gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyway, he trapped the real guardian, Flock Ornis in a baseball.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After we saved him, he had us do stuff to /actually/ start fixing the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far we have managed to fix the classpects and skaia, but we still have the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>, Glitch Clones and various other bugs in the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyway, Chronos also changed the session signature from 0xBACADE to 0x<span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafé</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which we named an actual Café after.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except for underlings, for some strange reason.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: eek...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyway, the only way to kill the clones is to use healing items.</span><br />
