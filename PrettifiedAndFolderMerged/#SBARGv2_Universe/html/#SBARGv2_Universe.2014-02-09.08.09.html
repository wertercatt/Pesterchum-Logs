[08:10:23] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: No, and you aren't going to hurt her either.</span><br />
[08:10:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right going back to sleep</span><br />
[08:10:42] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Good idea.</span><br />
[08:11:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tell me when kimura gets on, I'm gonna pester him a plan</span><br />
[08:11:20] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I don't think I'll do that.</span><br />
[08:11:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ben?</span><br />
[08:11:56] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: If he's here, he certainly isn't listening.</span><br />
[08:12:23] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: "No more death". Okay Charles, okay.</span><br />
[08:12:29] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: That's why you're planning to murder someone.</span><br />
[08:12:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: who said anything about murder</span><br />
[08:13:02] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Okay then, smart ass, what're you planning to do to her?</span><br />
[08:14:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: have you ever played megaman x?</span><br />
[08:15:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#941894">CURRENT moroseTerminator [CMT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:15:04] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Oh, don't tell me you're likening her to Sigma.</span><br />
[08:15:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: um no</span><br />
[08:15:13] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I saw it on the XBLA a few times, never played it though.</span><br />
[08:15:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to throw her in the AU Machine and have it constantly loop until she well, calms down.</span><br />
[08:16:11] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Also something I don't intend to stand by and watch you do.</span><br />
[08:17:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: either we fix her or we kill her.</span><br />
[08:18:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And to be fair, it would be easier to kill her.</span><br />
[08:18:44] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Lay a finger on her, and you'll regret it.</span><br />
[08:19:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Brad, I don't want to have to hurt you too.</span><br />
[08:20:21] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm not going to stand in your way, because that would be pointless, but if I find out you've locked her in that fucking machine, I'm getting her out. And if I find out you've killed her, I'm locking you in the fucking thing.</span><br />
[08:21:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so to kill her I would need to die in the process</span><br />
[08:21:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright fine</span><br />
[08:21:29] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'll find a way to revive her, and your death will have been pointless.</span><br />
[08:21:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess it would be heroic.</span><br />
[08:22:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If she godtier revives, I'll join you though Brad.</span><br />
[08:22:36] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Excuse me?</span><br />
[08:22:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, if paradox space doesn't consider it just, who am I to argue with it.</span><br />
[08:24:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or are you going to argue with that logic?</span><br />
[08:24:24] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: No, the 'I'll join you through Brad' part.</span><br />
[08:24:36] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm not sure what you meant by it.</span><br />
[08:24:40] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Wording confused me, is all.</span><br />
[08:25:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: join you in preventing further deaths of her I guess</span><br />
[08:25:54] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm glad you're partly seeing sense, but you don't need to kill her at all. What she did was in the past, and Ben happened to tick her off at the right moment. It would be like, three months from now, me sending one of Ben's close friends the video of his death.</span><br />
[08:26:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just don't want cody dto die.</span><br />
[08:26:32] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Cody won't die. The most likely one to kill it would be me, and I don't plan to.</span><br />
[08:26:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I already fucked up my relationship with Amy and regretted it when she died, I'm not going to make the same mistake again</span><br />
[08:27:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to be the best "uncle"</span><br />
[08:27:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (in quotes since none of us are related)</span><br />
[08:27:53] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Charles, this isn't about you, or your relationship. God fucking dammit, I lost my girlfriend and my daughter yesterday, and I'm still managing to shut the fuck up about what *I* want, so can you please respect that and do the fucking same?</span><br />
[08:27:55] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Honestly she wouldn't, and essentially /doesn't/, give a fuck about Cody. So there's nothing to worry about, really.</span><br />
[08:28:06] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Especially when what you want involves one of my best fucking friends being killed.</span><br />
[08:28:29] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: And yeah, she has way better things to do.</span><br />
[08:30:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fine</span><br />
[08:30:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but if cody dies, I'm going supernova on her planet</span><br />
[08:30:35] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: No you're not, because innocent people live there.</span><br />
[08:30:36] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Lots of them.</span><br />
[08:30:55] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: And in any case, good luck finding it in the first place.</span><br />
[08:31:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would both get back at Gambit and fufill that fucking cloud at the same time</span><br />
[08:32:13] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: ...and kill people in the process.</span><br />
[08:32:18] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: And then she'd kill you.</span><br />
[08:32:19] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: But would it make you the better person by doing that, Charles?</span><br />
[08:32:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell no</span><br />
[08:32:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but at this point I've... stopped caring</span><br />
[08:32:52] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Destroying an entire planet because a single spider dies is pretty dumb.</span><br />
[08:33:00] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Where do I send the fucking donations?</span><br />
[08:33:41] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: It could even possibly be grounds for a Just Death, even.</span><br />
[08:33:49] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Certainly not heroic.</span><br />
[08:37:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then I'm completely insane and should be stopped.</span><br />
[08:38:41] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: The problem is that you're not /thinking/ about this. Not truly so.</span><br />
[08:40:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I bet I'll be able to twist it to pretend its just a move on a chessboard</span><br />

[08:40:48] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Still not thinking.</span><br />
[08:41:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I WANTED TO HAVE A QUIET TIME IN THIS UNIVERSE FOR FUCKS SAKE</span><br />
[08:42:31] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Then fuck off and get it, nothing's stopping you.</span><br />
[08:42:40] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: It seems to be what you want.</span><br />
[08:42:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, because I have to deal with all of /your/ shit.</span><br />
[08:43:15] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Could always do the godly thing and make a place for yourself to hold domain over, like Mike and Gambit are already doing.</span><br />
[08:43:36] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: That way you don't regularly have to deal with bullshit.</span><br />
[08:43:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, then I would have to deal with /more/ bullshit.</span><br />
[08:44:00] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Who's forcing you to put up with our shit?</span><br />
[08:44:04] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Depends on how you run it.</span><br />
[08:44:10] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Just out of curiosity.</span><br />
[08:44:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...does noone here understand friendship?</span><br />
[08:45:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously, you guys act like its a disease.</span><br />
[08:46:00] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: You're the one acting like it's a disease. A parasite that's sucking the life out of you.</span><br />
[08:46:06] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I understand it competely, but I don't stand for people putting up with me.</span><br />
[08:47:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: augh</span><br />
[08:47:55] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Bottom line, do what makes you happiest.</span><br />
[08:48:04] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: As long as it doesn't involve fucking murder.</span><br />
[08:48:10] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Or anything of the sort.</span><br />
[08:48:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I want to spend time with my friends.</span><br />
[08:48:41] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Go the fuck ahead.</span><br />
[08:48:51] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: You can still do that while doing your own thing at the same time, can't you?</span><br />
[08:49:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but until Gambit calms down, It... doesn't feel /right/.</span><br />
[08:50:22] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Gambit is completely calm. I saw her just last night. Not even that, about seven hours ago.</span><br />
[08:52:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (stupid godly civil war)</span><br />
[08:53:59] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: You know she doesn't really do anything like this unless she's provoked, right?</span><br />
[08:54:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay then how did she get provoked enough to kill amy?</span><br />
[08:55:55] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I'm not sure she likes Ben too much.</span><br />
[08:57:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how the fuck does murder get provoked?</span><br />
[08:57:44] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Nah, she doesn't, but that also isn't to say she directly was involved in her death. Depends on how you look at it.</span><br />
[08:58:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well, it depends if we trust SL to tell the truth...</span><br />
[08:58:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Fuck, now I'm in the middle of a civil war.</span><br />
[08:58:55] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Gambit seems like the kind of person who needs a plan to kill or screw-over everyone she meets, her closest friends included. Ben just happened to set hers off.</span><br />
[08:59:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This never would have happened if Gambit could have just keep her mouth shut</span><br />
[08:59:58] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Also... the only reason why she sent him those videos was because he didn't believe she didn't have the guts to perma-kill him ever. Which she totally does.</span><br />
[09:00:54] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: She wanted to make sure he knew this fact.</span><br />
[09:00:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:01:19] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: That does not mean she's actively out to kill him.</span><br />
[09:01:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Brad. How much Bleeprin can you make.</span><br />
[09:01:47] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: She's done it before, I think. If not, she's come clos- Hell no. She doesn't want to hurt him, because she /doesn't give a shit/.</span><br />
[09:01:54] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: As much as you need, but I'm not making any.</span><br />
[09:01:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
[09:02:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we /can't/ wipe SL's memory.</span><br />
[09:02:49] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: No, that would be a bad idea in itself.</span><br />
[09:03:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why, we can't wipe his memory of the video?</span><br />
[09:04:23] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: No, that would be stupid. What if he finds it again? We'll have to go through this bullshit /again/. At least the hardest part is over and done with.</span><br />
[09:19:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CAE</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />

[09:21:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gotta keep SL from killing Gambit or vice versa</span><br />
[09:22:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because that is /not/ goo.</span><br />
[09:23:01] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: Again, Gambit won't do anything /unless/ Ben actually does something to legitimately anger her.</span><br />
[09:23:21] <span style="color:#941894">CMT: She would only be acting on self-defense.</span><br />
[09:23:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...right, so just try to calm down Ben it seems</span><br />
