[06:13:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...For a second I thought you were a friend of mine.</span><br />
[06:13:38] <span style="color:#aa5500">TT: Haha that's happened to me before</span><br />
[06:13:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Also, kinda stuck in a giant snowball right now.</span><br />
[06:13:46] <span style="color:#aa5500">TT: Oh my</span><br />
[06:13:53] <span style="color:#aa5500">TT: Can I be of assistance</span><br />
[06:14:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Um, you aren't exactly in the same universe.</span><br />
[06:14:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Plus you might be fictional from my perspective.</span><br />
