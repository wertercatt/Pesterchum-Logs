<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: 99% of the time i dont remember anyone's gender whether they're cis or trans</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Sure. Probably. But I'm just like, whatever roles someone decides they want to have are their own business. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> all gender role perceptions were "deleted"</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: This might sound really mean, but I think I have this dislike for kids or something.
