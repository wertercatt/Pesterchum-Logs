<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What's the difference between that and a temporal causality loop</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: In Blazblue Ragna's sword and his whole Bloodedge identity are a bootstrap paradox</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ragna takes up the sword, Blood-Scythe, and the surname Bloodedge, as homage to an unknown hero who helped his mentor out</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But he was the unknown hero or whatever the hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: another example, in futurama: Fry is his own grandfather (technically a subtrope, but related concept)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Except at a point in the story he ends up getting sent back in time, developing amnesia. So yeah he's that hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He inspires himself, who then goes back in time to inspire himself and so on. His sword's like the best example of that: 'Cause of that timey-wimey craziness, it has no origin</span><br />
