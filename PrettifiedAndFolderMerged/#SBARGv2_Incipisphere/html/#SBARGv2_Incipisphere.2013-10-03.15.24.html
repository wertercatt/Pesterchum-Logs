[03:54:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just wanna speed up the process</span><br />
[03:54:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: send it to a Dead Land.</span><br />
[03:54:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
[03:54:49] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: Y O U C A N N O T K I L L W H A T I S W I T H I N Y O U</span><br />
[03:54:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a volcanic Dead Land, more specifically.</span><br />

[03:55:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: actually</span><br />
[03:55:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll put it out</span><br />
[03:55:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and send it to chaos</span><br />
[03:55:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &gt;:D</span><br />
[03:55:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, that won't end well.</span><br />
[03:55:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the /best/ idea</span><br />
[03:55:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3.</span><br />
[03:55:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 2.</span><br />

[03:57:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I should have sent it backwards in time to chronos, but... eh, its not like those devices can break from the alpha</span><br />
[03:57:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh well</span><br />
[04:00:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (seriously though if I had done that, chronos would be killing me /now/)</span><br />
[04:01:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (or be laughing his ass off)</span><br />
[04:01:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (likely both)</span><br />
[04:01:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (yeah, I was about to say) ➜</span><br />
[04:01:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (uh, yeah. seriously.)</span><br />
[04:02:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (sending a furby to him is BEYOND sudokucidal.)</span><br />
[04:02:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (okay, I'll see about tracking LE down sometime)</span><br />
[04:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (and see if I can trick the two into killing eachother)</span><br />
[04:04:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (that would be crazy dangerous, but might just work) ➜</span><br />
[04:04:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (which is why it wouldn't)</span><br />
[04:05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (logicly we would need to kill chronos in a way that would /never/ work)</span><br />
[04:06:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (why are we whispering) ➜</span><br />
[04:06:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no idea</span><br />

[04:12:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe</span><br />

[04:18:33] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: gfff...</span><br />
[04:19:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hey, at least we ain't talking about it behind your back!</span><br />

[04:24:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: imagine her /later/</span><br />
[04:25:43] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((a cool angle would actually be her growing up fast enough that shes basically my age by the end of the game))</span><br />
[04:25:49] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...shes a good kid charles</span><br />
