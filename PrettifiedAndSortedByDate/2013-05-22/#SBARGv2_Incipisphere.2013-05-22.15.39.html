<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mornin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, I don't even know what time it is anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My computer clock, of all things, started to glitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is anyone there, or is pesterchum glitching on me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a8a87e">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I guess pesterchum isn't showing people that aren't on the memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, I think I need to improve the Brain to Machine interface I made.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After testing my AI clone for a few hours, It kinda... well, stopped acting like me... and more like a murderous asshole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Managed to wipe it out though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...After all, it was on an unconnected system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...There is no way he could have survived.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: God dammit, now I'm paranoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#e7d601">CURRENT maligndreaminG [CMG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ Did someone die? ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ D: ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I was talking about my AI clone that was... not installed right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets just say the AI was a Crapshoot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ Did he go bad? ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Did he try and rebel stating he was the best copy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ I hope my AI doesn't turn evil. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He figured out the code for some normal antimatter and told me to make it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ That's bad! ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Antimatter again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...The ammount of said antimatter would have wiped out the entire session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe he's just as stupid as you and didn't think about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ O.o ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, at least I use the holopad first!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats how I knew.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why did you even need antimatter?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I didn't need it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I quote "Hey make this code its gonna be awesome."</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then he gave me the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I checked the interface that I used to copy my brain, and it had major problems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...for example, it took far to long to do a brain scan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In which case, it was making a copy of parts of my brain, while the x axis was moving through time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ That's weird. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, it had major errors, and thus, quickly became insane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ Me and sprite me are going to go into this really hard dungeon now. ... If we don't come back tell everyone I'm sorry. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#e7d601">CMG: ~ Bye. .n. ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh god what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#4274c4">CURRENT shadowsPaintbrush [CSP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: AT LasT I'M FreE!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#c1bb10">CURRENT courageousScribe [CCS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: what?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: is going on\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: FoR ThE LasT FeW WeekS i WaS TrappeD IN a CybeR DungeoN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: HaD TO DestroY ThE MainframE TO GeT OuT</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: really it must be during the time I don't remember when that happened\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: WhaT DiD i MisS IN ThaT AmounT OF TimE?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CLL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I don't know i don't remember anything other than a tower and a stone bed\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, how are you sure your free?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You could still be in the simulation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: WelL i CaN ContacT YoU GuyS</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, from what we know, the universe is turning complete.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: turing*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The logical explanation is we are part of the simulation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, there is a certain XKCD comic that helps to get the point across.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.xkcd.com/505/'>http://www.xkcd.com/505/</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, how can one be sure you are out of the simulation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For all we know, we could be in some sort of twisted videogame... other than sburb, that is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: ThingS JusT SeeM...NormaL i GuesS. i CaN PlaneswalK FinE WitH MY RadaR, I'vE FounD MY ResidencE OK, AnD ThE ConsortS ArE MessinG ArounD WitH MY BelongingS AgaiN</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or for all we know he's fine and right where he thinks he is</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because I'm not in a simulation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why do you believe what you believe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because I'm not a jackass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I believe what I believe because believing in things that aren't happening is a total waste of time</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How do you know your green is my green?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we were both raised to call it green.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: My god it's because the rods for colours in our eyes are all the same</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's why red green colour blindness is a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You don't just believe things that don't make sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, but what about the way said rods are percieved?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How would you picture what a butterfly sees? or a mantis shrimp?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You wouldn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You can't see the colours they see</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You can't even begin to comprehend the colour they call "Glorsh" or whatever they call it in their tiny bug brains</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But this Glorsh could be their perception to what we percieve as "green"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Or, for a better example, what we consider "pink"</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This glorsh is not anything we've ever seen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As there is no such thing as pink light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or else we'd have a colour called glorsh</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV:  <span style="color:#ffc0cb">Looks pretty damned pink here</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, lets say, we have blue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One culture calls it gorm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But its blue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But we all see it as blue</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because that's how biology works</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And if it isn't, then why the hell do people agree that colours can be described by the things they create?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, emotions for example</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: When people think of blue it's usually something friendly, as a general concensus</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because of the way their brains consider the colors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But hey maybe the people that don't concede see it as red or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: /Our/ brains consider the colours</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, say you hold up a red piece of paper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Say you hold up a spatula</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You call it red, and everyone agrees.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Say I hand you a hamburger</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...actually, let me pull up a video.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evQsOFQju08'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evQsOFQju08</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This is getting progressively more stupid but I'll watch the video</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The moral of the story is where's the relevant XKCD for this actually being reality</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh god it was a Vsauce video trying to trap me HUH?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, now I know this is reality.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A computer would not react this way... unless it was a physics simulator-and I should shut up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe it's all just a simulator</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And here I am playing devil's advocate in the ultimate reverse psychology simulator of all time</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just to trick you into believing more into your simulation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, why would I worry about it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it was a simulation, shouldn't we be receiving information from outside, by accident?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think we have ever managed to overload reality... but how would we know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yes, pain is all just information from the outside</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because we're ALL BEING EXPERIMENTED ON</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we ourselfs did not exist on the outside?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Time's just floawing backwards to justif- oh I'm loosing a lot of blood</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I must be, to think of this shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But are just a collection of simulated particles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: EnougH. WhO CareS WhaT WE SeE IN OuR PerceptionS</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Finally SP says something okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Game plan what are we doing today</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, make a new AI, as my last was a total crapshoot.</span><br />
