<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...Any Idea where he isss? I have a bad feeling.</span><br />

<span style="color:#208060">CSN: hmm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...would it happen to be any birdsss in ssspecific? Eaglesss, perhapsss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why are you asking? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: Um, jussst a sssmall amount of hissstory that might be repeating itssself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I think it's crows that have been attacking him? that or ravens, not sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: SSSo not eaglesss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: Right, might jussst be a fluke then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess not. ...and I think the thing with Brad was he was afraid of being eaten by him while shrunk :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: SSShouldn't that be wearing off sssoon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually probably. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: And if that wasss the only reassson, he would be avoiding Asssh all the time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how would you know all this stuff? Why are you even so concerned about someone who's practically reached Kenny from south park tier? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: Caussse he ownsss my houssse basssically.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I haven't, but his shenans /are/ starting to get tiring...</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: Oh, like Impsss with broken legsss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: (ssseriousssly, they jussst... ssscream. And do nothing except get on your nervesss.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: (they aren't even ussseful normally, except when in a ssswarm)</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: (Power in numbersss for thossse guysss I guessssss)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (yeah, once you hit a certain power level, strength in numbers is the only threat even normal imps have)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (........that and Ohgodwhat Mode.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: what mode?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: freaky katamari mode pretty much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...Like, mutant onesss that eat eachother to get bigger and grow more limbsss and eyesss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you could also call it Voltron mode... depends on just how the mob-spawn algo decided to break.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not really, it's them being spawned /telefragged into each other/ and operating as one giant monster</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...ohgodwhat</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: exactly. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...and now I know why itsss called that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: I thought it wasss like, cloning failuresss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...Wait, did any of them ssspawn when sssomeone wasss blinking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: Actually, better quessstion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: How do you know if they are ssspawning or not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: I mean, they might jussst be sssneaking in everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#208060">CSN: ...What are you two doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: messing around on tumblr and drawing things. will probably play danganronpa later, still got one chapter and two Class Trials to finish...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, lets just hope the wonderwings can keep me safe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they probably can. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: got a specific location for me to head to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry for being pissed at you Kimura, but... knowing the circumstances I'm in... yeah.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...this is going to be a long one to explain. And it technically wasn't me who did it if you wanna take that old thought into consideration.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I just found "myself" sleeping in the forest... definitely doesn't smell like me though, so I'm assuming it's them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what should I do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, listen, the wonder wings don't exactly allow for me to do any well, "attacks".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So if you could figure out a way to let me out, that would be nice.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To be fair, this outcome was pretty much destined to happen as soon as I was shrunk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not the only one that is genre savvy enough ot see that, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, gonna have to pull an Emperor's Belly for this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm wondering if I should google that to find out if you are about to do something incredibly stupid/</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL, wh does everything always have to be about following some stupid trope with you? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *why ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (for the record, I was referring to when you have to shrink yourself and go inside the Emperor of Sei-An City to defeat a plague monster)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, real life isn't supposed to be about predictability based on media trends.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like seriously, there's more important things to be doing rather than figuring out how whatever event turned out exactly like that one thing.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe I should just shut up. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, you have a fair point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah SJ, you have a point.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seems like a boring enough day to play for a bit maybe? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I could do a server, but well... since I like mods so much, it would have to be modded.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... I guess I could put it up now? won't be paying much attention to it though, but...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he was action figure-sized for a week. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And by launch, I mean /activate the FTL/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Woo!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: How does it handle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still haven't landed on a planet though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It hasn't blown up right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The security on it is impressive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I do want to try and finish DR today though, and PPSSPP won't run at full speed with the MC client open, so for once I actually won't be on the server...))</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: So what else you guys doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kicked me out of the system after I managed to get the shields on the inside of the ship to keep the rest of the ship from getting vented when I was /going/ to open the cargo bay doors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...Wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Way to go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah those doors never got opened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thankfully.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not sure if the wonderwings would have withstood reentry into an alien atmosphere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: all because you were being a /moron/ when trying to stop Kat from going off the deep end onboard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So right now, I'm just stuck looking at the data for the next planet to visit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After we /finally/ land on this one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And noone wants to see me try to land it, I bet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I could probably regive you control if you ndded it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Needed*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, If I really tried, I could disable the security faster than it could kick me out.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((huh))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((my best guess is mojang upd8ed the serverside recently and that invalidated all the old login cookies))</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...backtrack? I thought the ferroplanet is /where we went in the first place/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, it isn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then again, I hadn't looked outside the ship since before we jumped so</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are at a planet with black grass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and giant insects it seems, due to the high oxygen levels.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((server offline for now, toast me when someone wants to go back on it))</span><br />

<span style="color:#8c7ea1">CIM: ((uhh...I don't think so?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and you were with the party until we found and chased Kat, and that was before, so yes, you should be able to know about Slim.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#5c6f61">CURRENT artfulDeviant [CAD]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: (( i remember the plush part ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: (( the poor thing was just, nailed to a wall ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: (( if i remember ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((just making sure my char isn't saying too much))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, considering IM has admitted to haresting despair from Kat, it isn't too far of a stretch that the freaky bio-tech in the Katstle probably belonged to whatever IM is supposed to be. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: A question still stands though: why was Charles able to escape the Katstle after looting the weird stuff out of it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is any of this making any sense or anything? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I feel like I'm probably still missing something important in this somehow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we probably don't have all the facts yet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and we won't until we get Kat back to normal and find out from her what happened</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though by then it may be too late... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: true :/</span><br />
