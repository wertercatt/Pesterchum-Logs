[09:53:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[09:53:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It also blew up.</span><br />

[09:54:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: morning DS</span><br />
[09:55:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( was that IC? ))</span><br />
[09:55:08] DS: Yeah it was weird<br />
[09:55:17] ((yes))<br />
[09:55:44] ((im using ios, so forgive my shitty encoding))<br />
[09:55:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( understood. ))</span><br />
[09:56:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I bet you see color codes ))</span><br />
[09:56:57] ((yeah i expected that. i just gotta remember to append my initals))<br />
[09:58:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He kinda bit me... that was a few days ago, I'm all healed up now.</span><br />
[09:58:42] DS: Ladon killed me<br />
[09:58:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know exactly what happened after I passed out...</span><br />
[09:59:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, well you should have done that</span><br />
[09:59:03] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .....hm.....</span><br />
[09:59:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shouldn't*</span><br />
[09:59:31] DS: it seemed like a good idea at the time<br />
[09:59:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was when I passed out...</span><br />
[10:00:01] DS: Plus we used the apples to power the machine!<br />
[10:00:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wha?</span><br />
[10:00:22] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...what?...</span><br />
[10:00:22] DS: so it all turned out good in the end<br />
[10:00:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[10:00:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#0000ff">FL.EXE HAS CRASHED</span></span><br />
[10:00:57] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...uuuhh...</span><br />
[10:01:18] DS: the machina does more than switch our classes. it had files on all of us<br />
[10:01:33] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...But I thought it exploded?...</span><br />
[10:01:49] DS: it did<br />
[10:02:12] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Did anyone get a look at those files before it blew up?...</span><br />
[10:02:12] DS: which was kind of dissapointing<br />
[10:02:18] yes<br />
[10:02:28] we looked a seth's<br />
[10:02:48] DS: it said hes corrupted.<br />
[10:05:39] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, that's kind of obvious, what with him turning into Chronos eventually, right?...</span><br />
[10:06:25] DS: Yes. the dual aspects corrupted him<br />
[10:07:21] DS: im still trying to piece together the lore, but i think that seth is post scratch cronos<br />
[10:07:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ugh</span><br />
[10:07:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you still don't get it</span><br />
[10:07:58] DS: Apparently not<br />
[10:08:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seth is the beginning of a series of twisted timetravel that ends with Chronos.</span><br />
[10:08:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CPP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[10:08:44] DS: that doesnt mean they cant be dancestors<br />
[10:08:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and all of us dying.</span><br />
[10:08:52] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
[10:09:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you trust FLord and what he said the horrorterrors said.</span><br />
[10:09:54] DS: could you please elaborate, ive never heard this story<br />
[10:11:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so back in the prescratch session, horror terrors stated that Chronos was created in the session we would create, and he killed everyone there when they tried to convince him to go through the door, which would apparently cause him to lose his powers.</span><br />
[10:11:12] DS: and i wouldnt trust FLord<br />
[10:11:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this is why we scratched, but stable timeloops and what not</span><br />
[10:12:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we scratched to attempt to prevent his creation, but it lead to this... and well, fuck.</span><br />
[10:12:31] DS: why would they scratch a completed session?<br />
[10:12:47] DS: ah<br />
[10:12:54] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...huh...</span><br />
[10:13:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course, the scratch created /this/ session... so...</span><br />
[10:13:48] DS: so instead of being reset, he was trasported his true session and given another aspect?<br />
[10:13:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no</span><br />
[10:14:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this session is his birthplace</span><br />
[10:14:21] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
[10:14:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and he tricked our last first guardian into letting him into /that/ session.</span><br />
[10:14:31] DS: so how did he get to the pre-scratch session?<br />
[10:14:46] DS: how?<br />
[10:14:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I assume the Jaspers method</span><br />
[10:15:22] DS: our first guardian? ornis?<br />
[10:15:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, our last one.</span><br />
[10:15:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently guardians change through scratches</span><br />
[10:15:42] DS: who?<br />
[10:15:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I heard that it was some sort of dolphin.</span><br />
[10:16:03] DS: so the seesion we werent playing in<br />

[10:16:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Dolphin.</span><br />
[10:17:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Our Pre-Scratch First Guardian was a fucking /dolphin/.</span><br />
[10:17:44] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...O...k...</span><br />
[10:18:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[10:18:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TL:DR last session was stupid</span><br />
[10:18:58] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, they had to deal with Chronos just like we have to, yeah?...</span><br />
[10:19:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[10:19:56] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Then I don't think it was stupid...</span><br />
[10:20:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FLord mentioned something called the <span style="color:#ffffff">White Flash</span> which destroyed the lands.</span><br />
[10:20:12] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Because then, through associative property, this session is stupid...</span><br />

[10:22:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I heard about that when I was Void...</span><br />
[10:22:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :?</span><br />
[10:23:00] DS: i heard someone use that to refer to the prescratch session<br />
[10:23:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think there were 3.</span><br />
[10:23:25] DS: we could use time travel to kill seth<br />
