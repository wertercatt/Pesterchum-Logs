[11:07:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay okay okay, so what we know about Chronos. He's a sick, twisted and power hungry sue given form, a combination of an Heir o- deal w/ it PK</span><br />

[11:07:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: of Time, and Prince of Space. My theory goes that Seth and Brae were the two halves he needed to give him a real, tangible form. He only reached out to them, and they had</span><br />
[11:07:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Similar traits</span><br />
[11:07:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's somewhat irrelevant but iiiit is important. Slightly.</span><br />

[11:08:59] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: yeah</span><br />
[11:08:59] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ A story command prompt. Σ</span><br />

[11:09:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Doubtful! Chronos can leave whenever he pleases with his anchors in place. He needs the station to teleport somewhere forward or backward in time</span><br />

[11:09:18] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: What Jack Noir, The mayor, and The Medicant used</span><br />

[11:09:24] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I wonder.</span><br />
[11:09:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: He mentioned something about Uranium! He undoubtedly stole it from us somewhere during...whatever time.</span><br />
[11:09:28] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: to go to the TROLL SESSION</span><br />
[11:09:37] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: oh yeah</span><br />

[11:09:55] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: I made a big cart of Uranium a while ago that disappeared</span><br />

[11:10:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I just... make uranium as I need it.</span><br />
[11:10:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ... so this is what he meant by he wasn't fully stable.</span><br />
[11:10:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do keep a spare though.</span><br />
