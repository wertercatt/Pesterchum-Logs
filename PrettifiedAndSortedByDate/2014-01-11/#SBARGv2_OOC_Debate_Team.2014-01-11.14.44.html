[02:44:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 OOC DEBATE TEAM.</span><br />
[02:44:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#cc0000">CURRENT avidCurator [CAC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[02:44:56] <span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: lol</span><br />
[02:46:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CAC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[02:47:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, our first session of debate will be the discussion of "game constructs" in the new universe.</span><br />
[02:48:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#00a600">CURRENT paleBeachbum [CPB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[02:48:20] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: wouldn't anything created with an alchemiter be a game construct?</span><br />
[02:48:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[02:48:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would be "constructed with a game construct" ➜</span><br />
[02:48:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A major factor in this might actually be the exiles, as they were able to exist on earth.</span><br />
[02:49:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#a80000">CURRENT fromAshes [CFA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[02:49:00] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ The Exiles, though /)</span><br />
[02:49:07] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Traveled through the Skaian portals /)</span><br />
[02:49:12] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ and ended up on earth /)</span><br />
[02:49:23] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Not the final game door /)</span><br />
[02:49:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#2d8a18">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[02:49:35] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that seems like semantics to me tbh</span><br />
[02:49:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So if anyy carapacians would show up theyy'd be from the new universes session /)</span><br />
[02:50:01] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Which I think we can agree, the Frog temple meteor hasnt even arrived yyet /)</span><br />
[02:50:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT paleBeachbum <span style="color:#00a600">[CPB]</span>  can't agree --</span><br />
[02:50:34] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I know we were placed at a random point int he Universes timelines but whyy dont yyou agree /)</span><br />
[02:50:44] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: wouldn't there be more than one frog temple</span><br />
[02:50:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, that is a point, but the new universe and the old one don't have any physical laws changed, plus Consorts and sprites have been brought through.</span><br />
[02:50:48] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: and if the universe is infinite</span><br />
[02:50:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ No /)</span><br />
[02:51:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT paleBeachbum <span style="color:#00a600">[CPB]</span>  thinks that probably more than one planet got sburb --</span><br />
[02:51:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PB has a point, we have nothing so far that states only one planet in a universe can have a successful session.</span><br />
[02:51:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT paleBeachbum <span style="color:#00a600">[CPB]</span>  is probably stupid but whatever --</span><br />
[02:51:40] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ THats.... okayy thats a decent point but whyy would yyou want that /)</span><br />
[02:51:54] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why do you not want it?</span><br />
[02:52:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's more than one planet out there that's been set up for being in a session, session time and standard universe time is seperate, but the point is AC's other session was canonicaly unsuccessful and probably went by a more standard set of SBURB rules. ➜</span><br />
[02:52:34] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: yeah</span><br />
[02:52:46] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: I was actually going to write a gaiden or whatever it was called at some point</span><br />
[02:52:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so a lot of things should be more restricted from AC's session stuff. ➜</span><br />
[02:52:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Personally, I find it interesting that First Guardians and Sprites were able to go through, but with a large degree of changes.</span><br />
[02:53:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why not use those sort of changes with the denizens and carapaces for example?</span><br />
[02:53:45] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB:  well</span><br />
[02:53:57] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: the carapaces I know can prototype outside of the session</span><br />
[02:53:58] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Okayy /)</span><br />
[02:54:04] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: because didn't PM do that?</span><br />
[02:54:06] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ then yyeah I can understand AC's people showing up /)</span><br />
[02:54:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PB, that was the case on Earth.</span><br />
[02:54:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we already know that going through the door tends to cause physical changes.</span><br />
[02:54:46] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: oh the doo</span><br />
[02:54:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if it were up to me and if I were a jerk about it, I would tell certain people to stop smuggling in denizens and chess people and consorts. ➜</span><br />
[02:54:47] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: *door</span><br />
[02:54:48] <span style="color:#00a600">CPB: then yeah</span><br />
[02:55:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mainly with the Sprites and Ornis.</span><br />
[02:55:06] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Im with yyou there SJ /)</span><br />
[02:55:08] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Like /)</span><br />
[02:55:19] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ The onlyy reason Im okayy with consorts /)</span><br />
[02:55:22] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ is because Nak got through /)</span><br />
[02:55:28] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ But naks whole thing was fucked up /)</span><br />
[02:55:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL was one of the primary smugglers, so you can understand where I am coming through on this.</span><br />
[02:55:35] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I gave up tryying to understand it /)</span><br />
[02:55:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nak is the best tho</span><br />
[02:55:50] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So, yyeah /)</span><br />
[02:55:58] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ thats the onlyy reason i was okayy with consorts /)</span><br />
[02:56:07] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ also, theyy didnt have anyything that could possiblyy destroyy worlds /)</span><br />
[02:56:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: heh, if cp was online i imagine wed be a lot more chill about everything</span><br />
[02:56:28] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he just has that effect doesnt he</span><br />
[02:56:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ash, I believe that is the logic for Ornis losing his powers.</span><br />
[02:56:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ...He does tend to have that impact /)</span><br />
[02:56:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYeah, Ornis went the sprite route /)</span><br />
[02:56:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: CP was one of the main canonbreakers, but I didn't want to say anything. ➜</span><br />
[02:56:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As well as the Sprites losing powers.</span><br />
[02:56:58] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think someone compared him to the mayor</span><br />
[02:57:00] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ He lost his powers and became a regular old Crane... that can talk /)</span><br />
[02:57:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why did you let the Sprites and Ornis through?</span><br />
[02:57:10] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ SJ /)</span><br />
[02:57:15] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ CP Still managed to keep within the canon though /)</span><br />
[02:57:22] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also personally i dont understand why we need to perfectly follow hs canon to begin with</span><br />
[02:57:23] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Despite the little Breaks here and there /)</span><br />
[02:57:30] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ He wasnt NEARLYY As huge an offender as some others /)</span><br />
[02:57:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he basically started the precident of the whole "game rip-offs everywhere" theme. ➜</span><br />
[02:57:55] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYeah but... Iunno /)</span><br />
[02:57:57] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Something about that guyy /)</span><br />
[02:58:04] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I enjoyyed everyy minuet of it /)</span><br />
[02:58:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, he's too nice to be mad at. ➜</span><br />
[02:58:14] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also unlike some other players his canon-breaking felt like an improvement over canon</span><br />
[02:58:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ He at least followed the rules when it came to Alchemyy and Grist /)</span><br />
[02:58:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: his canon-breaking felt like it was done well</span><br />
[02:58:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it had a basis, due to the glitches.</span><br />
[02:59:00] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ ..."So bad its good" Comes to mind /)</span><br />
[02:59:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like with a game like sburb that has a massive file size, spawning permissions could be screwed up.</span><br />
[02:59:27] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nah not that ash</span><br />
[02:59:45] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: more like he kind of broke canon... intelligently?</span><br />
[02:59:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, allowing normally alchemized items to become part of the world generation.</span><br />
[03:00:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least, thats how I understood CP's thing.</span><br />
[03:00:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: when he broke canon there was a point to it</span><br />
[03:00:26] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he wasnt just doing it for the sake of it</span><br />
[03:00:39] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Exactlyy /)</span><br />
[03:00:50] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ All in all CP was a huge offender but it FIT /)</span><br />
[03:00:54] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though i may want to point out</span><br />
[03:01:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: who knows what people might do with having denizens around</span><br />
[03:02:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly. Which is why I suggested stripping powers.</span><br />
[03:02:10] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no i mean</span><br />
[03:02:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: fun fact: the glitch/game hacking excuse was the only reason we could make up to have v2 actually being able to be a thing when v1 canonically said that there could be no further sessions from that version of earth. ➜</span><br />
[03:02:32] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: not having them around just shuts down plots that could be there</span><br />
[03:02:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: good /and/ bad</span><br />
[03:03:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes. After all, I kinda wanna keep the Firebird so people can interact with her. Not because of her powers, but what her powers /made her into/.</span><br />
[03:04:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, I might be able to count the times Denizens left planets if you are using that excuse... Though it was usually some players and in the primary case, Rob.</span><br />
[03:05:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because of Dae and his kids showing up at the <span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafé</span>.</span><br />
[03:05:47] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYeah, uh... /)</span><br />
[03:05:56] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ FL some of those things slipped under our noses /)</span><br />
[03:06:02] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Rob was a pretty big canon-breaker too. ➜</span><br />
[03:06:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: rob was literally a gm though right</span><br />
[03:06:14] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ And byy the time we had learned about them, theyy had alreadyy happened and it was too late to Retcon them /)</span><br />
[03:06:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: only for  the last half really ➜</span><br />
[03:06:26] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: then its certainly too late now</span><br />
[03:06:40] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ No ones made mention of, or even interacted with those denizens though /)</span><br />
[03:06:41] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ theyy're just /)</span><br />
[03:06:43] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ kinda there /)</span><br />
[03:07:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: to facilitate potential future plots</span><br />
[03:07:06] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So i dont see what the big deal with them not being there is /)</span><br />
[03:07:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I'm suggesting the power strip method. That should prevent the denizens being used horribly.</span><br />
[03:07:34] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: anyway im dinner</span><br />
[03:07:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, some people made... attachments with the denizens.</span><br />
[03:07:49] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYes, thats... thats the point of them, FL /)</span><br />
[03:07:52] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ YYou're supposed to /)</span><br />
[03:08:08] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ so when yyou have to kill them, yyou've made the journeyy into yyour title /)</span><br />
[03:08:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i made attachments to amy but i still murdered her when the time was right</span><br />
[03:08:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is a Replay Value thing.</span><br />
[03:08:32] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ But it makes sense /)</span><br />
[03:08:33] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (though i still think it was a bit too early)</span><br />
[03:08:52] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ And yyou guyys were running off Replayy value for nearlyy everyything anyywayy /)</span><br />
[03:09:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We broke off at alot of points.</span><br />
[03:09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We took inspiration from it, but didn't let it take over.</span><br />
[03:09:33] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ yyeah /)</span><br />
[03:09:36] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ But /)</span><br />
[03:09:57] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Of all the things that would ba allowed throuhg the door /)</span><br />
[03:10:08] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Do yyou honestlyy think a Denizen would be one of them? /)</span><br />
[03:10:12] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Like think about the Betas denizens /)</span><br />
[03:10:30] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Would Dave be able to just hike up Hephaestus and chuck him through the door? /)</span><br />
[03:10:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you put it like that, no.</span><br />
[03:11:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would seem a bit out of character for Dave to do. ➜</span><br />
[03:11:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But would you expect Jade to chuck... Bec through the door in an AU?</span><br />
[03:12:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, Bec would likely follow due to GOOD DOG BEST FRIEND</span><br />
[03:12:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think if anything, its a matter of /who would want to go through/.</span><br />
[03:14:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really think the problem here is how the denizens in our session were characterized with limited idea on how they were supposed to operate. ➜</span><br />
[03:14:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, a large majority of denizens might not want to go through, but others might want to move to some new land, something more interesting.</span><br />
[03:15:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, according to the game, they're "supposed" to be the main plotpush for the players to fix the problems on their land. ➜</span><br />
[03:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which FL absolutely failed at, and his land was destroyed.</span><br />
[03:18:55] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Denizens are immenselyy powerful NPCs found in Sburb sessions. Theyy are, at first, supposedlyy asleep, but as the playyer progresses through the Seven Gates, theyy awaken. However visiting a denizen earlyySburb Logo causes them to wake up prematurelyy.Sburb Logo Each is said to guard an immense Grist hoard, to be released upon their defeat and used for the Ultimate Alchemyy, although their true purpos</span><br />
[03:18:55] <span style="color:#a80000">appears to be to offering playyers The Choice which differs depending on the circumstancesSburb Logo but seems to be based on facing yyour mortalityySburb Logo. The denizens control the underlings and are responsible for manyy of the problems found on the playyers' planets. /)</span><br />
[03:19:04] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Just copyypastaed from the wiki /)</span><br />
[03:19:26] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ The denizens appear to speak in a manner or language that onlyy their respective playyers understand, as Karkat was unable to understandSburb Logo what Echidna said to Jade, and despite Kanayya also being assigned Echidna had to askSburb Logo Jade what Echidna had said to her. YYaldabaoth also to spoke to Caliborn in a wayy that onlyy he understood. Some of the denizens mayy have a connection to the as</span><br />
[03:19:26] <span style="color:#a80000">that form part of a playyers' title. /)</span><br />
[03:20:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps it is a more psychic connection, after all, later on, Jade was going to send Kanaya to speak with Echidna.</span><br />
[03:20:34] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ true /)</span><br />

[03:21:22] <span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ So yyes most of us were waaaaayy out of line in the denizen department /)</span><br />
