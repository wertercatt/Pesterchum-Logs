[05:24:33] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: costs approximately 18mil in galactic credits.</span><br />
[05:24:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how much does a loaf of bread cost?</span><br />
[05:24:57] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: 16 dollars.</span><br />

[05:25:31] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: You can get a loaf for as low as 4 dollars on some planets</span><br />
[05:26:40] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: All known Nuklonium weighs at about 3tons. 8 pounds of which has been turned into a statue.</span><br />
[05:26:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so a thousand times as valuable as gold?</span><br />

[05:28:07] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Aaaahhhh!</span><br />

[05:28:33] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Good enough!</span><br />
[05:29:21] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: However.</span><br />
[05:29:25] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: I won't sell.</span><br />

[05:32:12] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Interesting/</span><br />
[05:32:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. Gambit's default (and original) gender though is female, so when in doubt, use "she" I guess.</span><br />
[05:33:20] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Ah.</span><br />
[05:33:40] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: If I recall correctedly, there were multiple gender swappers among you yes?</span><br />
[05:35:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just two others.</span><br />
[05:35:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless we use potions.</span><br />
[05:35:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since magic is real and all.</span><br />

[05:36:20] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Actually I have questions about that woman that showed up and broke up that incident you were having a while ago. I remeber that they were a gender swapper and also caught their name but the rest is a complete mystery!</span><br />
[05:36:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all, magic implys its mysterious or supernatural.</span><br />
[05:37:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm pretty sure if we studied it, it might turn out to be a form of manipulation of physics at the quantum level or something.</span><br />
[05:37:40] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: Also that Doc guy.</span><br />
[05:37:54] <span style="color:#555555">CFI: He kinda piqued interest but he was gone pretty fast.</span><br />

[06:54:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It doesn't seem to be straight multiplication, since sometimes it goes x4 and x8... but usually x2...</span><br />
[06:55:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe it has something to do with square roots?</span><br />
[06:55:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, 6 is multiplied by 4...</span><br />
[06:56:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
[06:56:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...perhaps the amount of times its divisible by 2?</span><br />

[06:58:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: good point. 2x2 = 2^2.</span><br />
[06:58:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 81 is 9 squared...</span><br />
[06:58:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and 9 is 3 squared... but that doesn't fit...</span><br />
[06:58:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "resulting number" implies 81 is on the left...</span><br />
[06:58:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />

[06:59:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 81 is also 3^4, so... hmm...</span><br />
[07:00:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also, I'm thinking 2 /needs/ to be treated as x2 and not ^2, or there isn't a pattern.</span><br />
[07:00:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, 9 is 3^2, and it was multiplyed by 4...</span><br />

[07:00:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm sorta thinking it might be square roots almost.</span><br />

[07:02:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the squares are when the left number is a multiple of four... and 80 is, but 81 isn't...</span><br />
[07:03:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then why did 10 get multiplied by 4...</span><br />

[07:14:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well fuck.</span><br />
[07:14:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 81 = 1296</span><br />
[07:15:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or 81*2^4</span><br />
[07:15:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I'll continue working on the puzzle once this debate thingy is over, I can't listen and math simultaniously))</span><br />
[07:16:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see, 8 was the biggest number in the first thing... maybe the biggest power of 2 thats under 100?</span><br />
[07:16:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but what is 64^2</span><br />
[07:16:32] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((FL, that means stop giving away the answer for at least a couple minutes))</span><br />
[07:16:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I'M NOT GIVING IT AWAY. ))</span><br />
[07:16:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((sorry...))</span><br />
[07:17:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((should I leave now?))</span><br />
[07:17:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...nope, the answer isn't 4096.</span><br />
[07:17:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( No, join in actually. ))</span><br />
[07:17:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Since I figure you might like it slightly. ))</span><br />
[07:18:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, great. Now what.</span><br />
[07:18:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((but I'm not in the mood for math which doesn't really have a context))</span><br />
[07:18:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( well when kimura gets back, you could ask /why/ we are doing this... IC. ))</span><br />
[07:18:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((also, I'm sorta busy working on my completely useless action platformer))</span><br />
[07:19:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well, I am technically still here... I just can't math while someone is talking in my ear :P))</span><br />
[07:23:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[07:24:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this puzzle is stupid.</span><br />
[07:24:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shouldn't 64 be the biggest result?</span><br />
[07:25:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since its 2^8, and 96 was 3^4x2^4...</span><br />
[07:25:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or maybe that last answer was a fluke.</span><br />
[07:36:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... what /is/ the pattern, then?</span><br />
[07:37:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No idea.</span><br />
[07:37:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyone got a clue?</span><br />
[07:38:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, what are you guys working on? ➜</span><br />
[07:38:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We think my account might be getting jacked again.</span><br />
[07:38:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, who's "we" here? ➜</span><br />
[07:38:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So right now we are trying to work our way through a puzzle to get to the bottom of this.</span><br />
[07:38:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, me and Kimura.</span><br />
[07:39:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since I know /I/ didn't post that last post on my account.</span><br />
[07:39:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and why don't you have a better password on your tumblr account? ➜</span><br />
[07:39:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, how many computers do you check your dash on daily? ➜</span><br />
[07:39:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its something noone would ever be able to guess... and just mine.</span><br />
[07:40:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Its only IC, I'm fine OOC ))</span><br />
[07:40:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I know))</span><br />
[07:42:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the question now seems to narrow down to this: who would want to be your computer in the first place? ➜</span><br />
[07:42:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: be on, you mean</span><br />
[07:42:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless you think its a rogue AI or something.</span><br />
[07:42:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, typo ➜</span><br />
[07:44:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: though the star... okay, now I'm really confused.</span><br />
[07:46:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does this have anything to do with that 3rd person perspective thing that was recently posted on your blog? ➜</span><br />
[07:46:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[07:46:41] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how do you know? ➜</span><br />
[07:47:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: found the link to the black box page in the clock page with comments next to it.</span><br />
[07:47:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, more like embedded in the id of the source.</span><br />
[07:47:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we have 3266785 seconds until that timer at the way bottom runs out.</span><br />
[07:48:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, less.</span><br />
[07:49:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doesn't really seem like much of a rush... then again, thats also what happened with another thing, and Kimura says he found the blackbox page before somehow...</span><br />
[07:54:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just hope this doesn't end up like timesten</span><br />

[08:10:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Piratepad is taking its sweet time.</span><br />

[08:18:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (there)</span><br />
[08:18:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, so how do we figure out how the multiplyer works?</span><br />

[08:19:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: is there even actually a pattern?</span><br />
[08:19:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still not sure why we're solving a puzzle that this haxxor guy posted here though. ➜</span><br />
[08:19:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, if it gave examples for 1-20, a pattern would be visible. but just 1-10 isn't enough</span><br />
[08:20:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, what if this puzzle is just a ruse..... a DISTACTION? ➜</span><br />
[08:22:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what if this guy already hass the car? ➜</span><br />
