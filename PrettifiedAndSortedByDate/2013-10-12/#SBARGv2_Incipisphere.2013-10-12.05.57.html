[06:00:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ah crap fuck.</span><br />
[06:22:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: on a scale of 1 to 10 on how much stuff seems to be getting real</span><br />
[06:22:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we are at an 8.</span><br />
[06:38:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000ff">CURRENT blueBassist [CBB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:38:43] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...morning...</span><br />
[06:38:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah not exactly good now is it</span><br />
[06:39:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we have to prepare for the reckoning</span><br />
[06:39:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like</span><br />
[06:39:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /fast/</span><br />
[06:39:10] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
[06:39:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which means we have to put petty squabbles on hold.</span><br />
[06:41:20] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...What makes you say this?...</span><br />
[06:41:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I will be converting the hoard that I have into boondollars for SBURBan Finale.</span><br />
[06:41:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: did you /not see/ the source of the pages the v2 blog posted?</span><br />
[06:42:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we manage to take care of the reckoning, that will give us time to earn the money to get the grist back.</span><br />
[06:43:27] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...I see it now...</span><br />
[06:43:49] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Wouldn't that mean that we would have to fast track the ectobiology stuff?...</span><br />
[06:44:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, ectobiology isn't a thing for us, and we can likely delay the genesis frog until after the reckoning is taken care of.</span><br />
[06:45:24] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
[06:46:54] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...That would also mean that I might have to fast track this crazy Land Quest of mine, huh?...</span><br />
[06:47:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
[06:47:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe</span><br />
[06:47:48] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...This is the Reckoning we're talking about. Once it starts, I'm pretty sure some screwy shit is gonna happen alongside it...</span><br />
[06:47:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure its quite possible for us to handle the side quests after the main story is done... yeah, I know I'm treating this like a video game.</span><br />
[06:48:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good point.</span><br />
[06:48:24] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Mind you, Mr. Smiley is still out there somewhere...</span><br />
[06:48:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, in homestuck, the reckoning was a 24 hour countdown.</span><br />
[06:48:52] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
[06:49:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which means we /do/ need to prepare.</span><br />
[06:49:18] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah...we may or may not have that luxury...</span><br />
[06:49:20] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Damn...</span><br />
[06:51:48] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...How do you prepare for something like that though? What are we supposed to do when it starts?...</span><br />
[06:53:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We run to Skaia and take care of the Black King.</span><br />
[06:53:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: while a squad finishes up things on derse.</span><br />
[06:53:50] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah... First we should find out how much time we have, if any...</span><br />
[06:54:07] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Then go from there...</span><br />
[06:54:57] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah, I should continue holding off on that too...</span><br />
[06:56:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Time to shatter the stock market for /serious biznasty/</span><br />
[07:02:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, done.</span><br />
[07:02:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you guys would like me to wire boons for sburban finale to you guys, now would be a good time.</span><br />
[07:03:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thankfully, the price droped after the first purchase as expected, following the pattern.</span><br />
[07:04:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, pay no mind to the paniced consorts in the stock market</span><br />
[07:04:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They only just had to deal with the entire economy folding in on itself.</span><br />
[07:08:13] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...</span><br />
[07:08:25] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...There isn't much of a stock market on my Land...</span><br />
[07:09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there is now so much grist in the stock market that most of the consorts lost their investments.</span><br />
[07:11:58] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Huh...</span><br />
[07:12:29] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Can I ask you something, Charles?...</span><br />
[07:12:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shoot</span><br />
[07:12:59] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Do you honestly think I can make a difference in this session /without/ going God Tier just yet?...</span><br />
[07:13:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
[07:13:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is your dreamself still alive?</span><br />
[07:13:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not being god tier gives you an extra life that can be used for a heroic death.</span><br />
[07:13:51] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yes. I hid him away when the Dreamself Killings were happening...</span><br />
[07:14:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, put him on the crypt</span><br />
[07:14:37] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Why?...</span><br />
[07:14:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so if you die in battle, when he begins to "melt" away... that will be when you go God Tier.</span><br />
[07:15:18] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...there's still the fact that I haven't met my Denizen yet either...</span><br />
[07:15:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I bet he/she will understand.</span><br />
[07:15:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heres to hoping he/she isn't a /complete/ asshole.</span><br />
[07:16:22] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, according to all accounts I've come across, it's almost a guarantee...</span><br />
[07:16:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
[07:16:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Echidna was cool.</span><br />
[07:17:02] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I bet you'd be in a sour mood if you were locked away under a frickin' mountain...</span><br />
[07:17:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I guess a bunch of the others are cool as well... ehhh</span><br />
[07:17:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
[07:18:13] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Plus I hear he might have been Echidna's mate at one point...</span><br />
[07:18:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Typhetus or what ever his name was?</span><br />
[07:19:22] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Everyone's referred to him as Typheus, but whenever I do research, I find his name written out as Typhon...</span><br />
[07:19:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah okay</span><br />
[07:19:46] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Which I find somewhat funny...</span><br />
[07:20:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah well</span><br />
[07:21:10] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...One 'o' away from Typhoon...Breath Denizen...</span><br />
[07:22:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
[07:23:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets take care of getting Sburban finale to everyone</span><br />
[07:26:40] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Ok...</span><br />
[07:27:01] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Maybe I should take Gambit's advice to heart when it comes to getting through those caverns...</span><br />
[07:32:50] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Anyway, I should go...</span><br />
[07:32:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003829'>http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003829</a> that is where I got the 24 hour thing</span><br />
[07:33:34] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...Well, we don't know for sure how much time we have...</span><br />
[07:33:40] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...We should figure that out first...</span><br />
[07:34:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but thats supposedly how much time we get after it starts</span><br />
[07:34:21] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...supposedly...</span><br />
[07:34:33] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...we need to change that into a "definitely" first...</span><br />
[07:34:49] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...For all we know, we could have more time...</span><br />
[07:34:49] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...or less...</span><br />
[07:34:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[07:35:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: either way</span><br />
[07:35:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we will need to hurry</span><br />
[07:35:12] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah...</span><br />
[07:35:29] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Anyway, I need to go take care of a few things with some of the villagers before trying to go down into the cavern again...</span><br />
[07:35:34] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...See you later...</span><br />
[07:35:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why I saw fit to pretty much just fuck over the economy on my land</span><br />

[08:25:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But its not like its a requirement to finish the Genesis Frog before saving skaia</span><br />
[08:25:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right?</span><br />

[08:26:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So after we take out the Black King, I would be able to earn back enough grist for the universe in... three years?</span><br />
[08:27:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does three years sound like the correct amount of time?</span><br />
[08:29:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Slowly grinding underlings in order to get the grist needed for it?</span><br />
[08:29:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: collecting more boondollars to get the grist back out of the stock exchange?</span><br />
