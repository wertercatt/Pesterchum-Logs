<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So where is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also wondering: why does dungeon entry require the sprites to come with?</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: The other catch is that once you enter its imPossible to leave untill you have layed claim to all of the treasure inside</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait wait wait, isn't that a loophole and we'll all die?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We can't all get the treasure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Every boonbuck, every random doo-dad, everything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: I hear that the treasure system is based more on the good loot</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's get some loot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Hell yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: And it just requires all the good loot to be claimed by one in the Party</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so in other words, empty the dungeon of anything that even remotely looks like treasure</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: We need the sPrites because if were not with them when we enter, everyone wil die if 1 Person forgot their sPrite</span><br />
<span style="color:#02b5a9">CPK: So CP, do you REALLY have your sPrite</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Man.</span><br />
