<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, and gentlemen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No it's cool I'm a pretty lady</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: So, how ya folks doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just talking aspects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I still don't know mine!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, it feels like space with my talking about physics, but I don't have a frog land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I used to think I was a Mind player (claspect tests and pre-entry life experience correlating as such), but now, I don't have a clue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: only ones I know I'm not are Space (no Frogs land parameter) and Time (no clock-themed land parameter)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So are you telling me I have the space</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: based on what we've seen in canon, pretty good chance of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (though Frogs as the *first* half of the land title is unusual)</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fascinating stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I could be light...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As Light can also symbolize knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((probably what happened there is the FG just made a flat-out randomizer for the land name thing, with no checks for specific items or if you get the same thing twice))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Clockwork and Frogs? Or worse, Frogs and Frogs? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: what's you ling, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My LAND is Steam and Crossroads.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There are a lot of trains.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fuel and Metal based grist... its decent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So... Page of Light perhaps?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As my KNOWLEDGE about alchemy may be able to increase my power exponentionally.</span><br />
