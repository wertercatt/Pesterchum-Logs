[11:50:49] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: I told everyone this before</span><br />
[11:50:58] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: but I think there might be something going on with EQ</span><br />
[11:51:02] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: ((ICly))</span><br />
[11:52:52] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: she seems a bit... off... especially after that fight I had with her yesterday...</span><br />
[11:52:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It might not be wise, but I figure we should still obey her wishes and not go after her.</span><br />
[11:53:04] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: You know about it?</span><br />
[11:53:21] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: I think her denizen is manipulating her</span><br />
[11:53:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: If she thinks a denizen is decent company, then there is /obviously/ something wrong with her.</span><br />
[11:53:56] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: check this post out:</span><br />
[11:53:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But, I just... I don't wanna make things worse.</span><br />

[11:54:23] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: that's the one</span><br />
[11:56:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( CONNECTION ))</span><br />
[11:56:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well...</span><br />
[11:56:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Last time I didn't do anything in this case, we lost someone.</span><br />
[11:56:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But... I still can't do anything.</span><br />
[11:57:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Because if there is the chance that she isn't going to be manipulated, this will turn out badly.</span><br />
[11:58:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: isn't being*</span><br />
[11:58:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I'll leave you alone.</span><br />
[11:59:12] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: and yesterday she said some stuff about using her powers to get whatever she wants</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: (( ? ))</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: why not?</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: we need to monitor her well</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: She said something about this utopia...</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: Okay.</span><br />
[11:59:13] <span style="color:#00e100">AC: bye</span><br />
