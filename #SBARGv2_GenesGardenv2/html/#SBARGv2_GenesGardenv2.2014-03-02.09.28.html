<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the what now, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  gestures at the falling cherry blossoms outside. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...no. bad FL. you're not burning /any/ trees down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh come on, it came out of nowhere, its likely a bad sign.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or maybe the tree was already there and just recently bloomed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's... kinda how cherry blossoms /work/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't remember seeing it before it bloomed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I would remember one tree thats bigger than all the rest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either way, I can't let you burn it FL... at least not until we find out if it actually is a threat to the rest of the forest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  internal monologue: "hell, for all we know, it's actually a Guardian Sapling, and cutting it down would destroy the whole forest........" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, and who do we know that can actually confirm it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kat? Shes currently off in tentacle growth land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Angel? She wouldn't tell us the truth even if it /was/ a danger.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait, why wouldn't she?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause she kinda hates us, remember?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bleh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay FL, let me put it this way. if both Lifers we know that are still around won't help us... then we'll wait and see if anything happens with the tree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and if something does and damages the forest, I'll accept your "I told you so" and help rebuild the forest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If trees start dying around it, I'm burning it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, Kimura, you know what would be fun to do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Some sort of sky block map.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, no. Better idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Flatgrass Map with generate structures on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And see how far we can get in survival.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( CP? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we probably should resume doing minecraft at some point...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or Starbound.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bluh... still haven't been able to have time to learn that game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, maybe we could use some computing power over here to get the bitcoins to exchange to get money to buy that... other game that is gonna be coming out soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What was it called again...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like minecraft and starbound combined...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is trying to figure it out in his head. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also, since I'm a SHSL Procrastinator on /literally everything/ lately, I don't think minecraft's gonna be able to be a thing until I can finish the group photo stuff...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh wait, are you talking about Seed of Andromeda or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Latura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, that. well, I still haven't heard anything new about it, so my Beta Earth self hasn't gotten a release out yet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((dammit Shadow, get the freakin' account system built so we CAN release!))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, multiplayer's not a thing with it either, last I /did/ hear...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, dangit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe we could play doom?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess that's a thing that's possible... considering how well SRB2 worked once I got the ports aligned correctly...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wish we had some other people that practiced magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, Kimura.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you ever tried to draw... other stuff with your tail?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: stuff besides the brush techniques? sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: comes out... about the same actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  replicates two metal cups. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, try and draw a U on these.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Connecting them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, the Magnetism move or...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Magnetism.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does so, and it works --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, so you can use Chibi's Brush Techs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hold on, I just thought of an exploit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. I learned them about the same time as my custom techniques like Waterbomb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, but I would need to keep it moving some how...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How long does it last?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... until the two objects are next to each other, or as close as they can get if there's an obstruction like a wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, so the magnetism doesn't stay that way... dammit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, fraid so. what were you thinking of trying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Using Magnetism to power an electrical generator.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I could likely create a magical steam engine from the junk in my fetch modus...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just as long as you don't accidentally build Thomas the Tank Engine :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause the trains on my land had these magical flames...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  uncaptchas some bottled flames, white and black. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ooh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The White flames seem to create heat, while the black ones absorb it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Always found them in pairs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess that's logical. like matter-antimatter particle pairs at the event horizon of a black hole, or something like that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured it was like Black and White Hole pairs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually, that works better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seven Twenty Four One Three.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we gotta find the cause of /that/, too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, since when did we put the village on a fucking fault line.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...we didn't?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see, giant tree growing out of nowhere, the earth coming alive, quaking...</span><br />
<span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Personally, I'd say the earthquakes are more important than the tree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What came first?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The quakes, or the tree?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the quakes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, so it can't be the trees roots tearing through the ground under us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  was about to do a "YOU'VE GOT THAT WRONG!" pose if FL blamed the tree for the quakes, but nvm :P --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT timeTravlur <span style="color:#6507ff">[CTT]</span>  //snrk. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...in fact, I think the quakes started when Kat first disappeared...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...In hindsight it should have been pretty obvious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who wants to bet she is responsible for the tree as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, it makes sense when you treat events as if they were happening in a movie, book, or video game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I suppose so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but what would she have to do with the tree?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Life powers, Touhou references...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like I'm pretty sure a giant cherry blossom was a major plot point in one of the games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: now that you mention it... yeah, I guess it does make sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, one is the namesake of the seventh game in the series.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still, considering the Starterquakes have been going on for a month and the tree only appeared a week ago, the latter is definitely not the cause of the former.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but we know Kat is a massive touhou fan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it would be likely she would make a giant cherry blossom as a reference.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: question is, what is she trying to tell us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um... the tree is needed to break a seal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is looking on the wiki. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay. after FL looked up a thing about Touhou in connection to that cherry blossom tree a couple miles out of town, he, AD, and I went to go try and destroy the tree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but shit started happening, and I grabbed FL and ran. I thought AD was doing her own abscondy thing, but...</span><br />
