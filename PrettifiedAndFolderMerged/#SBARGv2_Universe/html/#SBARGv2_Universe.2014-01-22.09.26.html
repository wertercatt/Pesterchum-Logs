<span style="color:#008400">CDS: aganst*</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: wow that sounds wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this almost sounds more fanfic-y than the Mewtwo incident. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: yah</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: its almost a hotel worthy level of shananagans</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft, yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that reminds me, we haven't had a hotel event in months. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: well a lot has happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: happened*</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: wow I didnt relise how nucth junk I had in my silydex.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it happens. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe something we could do this weekend if nothing else is going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also DS, how does something (that being captchaed, should be /time-locked/) unshrinking itself cause your entire sylladex to flip the fuck out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we have the same fetch modus, and I've /never/ had that problem...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...then again, I've never captchaed a Space-shrunk thing before, let alone /an entire spaceshit/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: do you realise how big a Galaxy class star ship is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS:  <a href='http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Galaxy_class'>http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Galaxy_class</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I τhoughτ space-shrunk τhings don'τ unshrink or aτ leasτ don'τ for a long τime</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: right</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I mean Jade kepτ τhe shrunken planeτs for like...more τhan a year? τhen again she's a wiτch so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and even if there's an "unshrink timer", captchaing the object is /supposed/ to pause it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: but we are talking about 4,500,000 metric tons</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unless you have a modus that doesn't support time-locking, but SAO and Filesystem both /do/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I always thought size changing was permanant unless specified. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: it depends on what class you are</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: weighτ doesn'τ counτ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Mass</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: mass is the same no matter what you do to it inles you take awway atoms</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: which would induse a rezolution problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... well, Jade's shrunken planets, /including Post-Scratch Earth/, didn't exhibit their ordinary gravity, so clearly Witch of Space shrinking at least does in fact reduce mass (or at least pretends to) when shrinking things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: but she did have first gardian powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (ok Super T&amp;T, why do you have the /earliest closing time/ of ANY version of the Nooklings' stores?!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: new leaf?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seriously, 8pm closing time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Night evryone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: goodnight Shon ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: night Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: night</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: save the log for mme if he comes back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CIB</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, are you guys alright over there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at the bar? yeah, we're fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I am internally facepawing so hard right now. EQ, we almost stereo-fibbed :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Leeeets just refrain from talking about where we lived around Fluffy, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also question: are we changing to the "also aliens sort of" explanation for Brad and the other Animal Tiers? or going with what the /original/ explanation of us having been human originally, until "something" happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: For the other animal tiers... uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I think a mutation/something happened excuse would fit better than just saying they are from an entire different species.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Because they look just too similar to us "normal humans" to qualify for the ladder. :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, just wondering because that /was/ the excuse for all of us, until you went and said I wasn't from this planet &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is just really hoping Fluffy doesn't have Sherlock Tier deduction skills, or we're boned --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: CP, its easier to explain some people having wings, than someone WHO CAN TURN INTO A WOLF WITH PAINT-MAGIC WHENEVER THEY WISH.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........fair enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: just sayin</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (now that I think about it, my specific animal-tiering really is weird... and probably would've been more mundane if I had prototyped just a normal wolf instead)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so: I'm from a different planet, the other animal tiers are modified humans. is that our cover story basically?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 's far as I know.</span><br />
