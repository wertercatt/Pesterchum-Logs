<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm worried about screwing something up on the ship. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: defs</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Smart</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like im fine with being in the hold with this weird star trek thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think ill let his consort mechanics install it, actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: only one question: where do you even find a warp core? ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fair enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sounds like a plan. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that was kind of my plan to begin with but</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, something I gotta remember to test out: what my range limit is on brushportalling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well you could do it anywhere in the incipisphere right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but that's a pretty contained range. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, but that's probably 100 miles in diameter at the most...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But the incipi was fairly small, compated to... space itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: more than 100 miles i should think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i explored most of it one time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its pretty big</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yes, but even then: It is tiny compared to a universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but between it and the transportalizers back home</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So, testing out the range of brushportaling again could not hurt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we should be fine for most things</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...funny what reminds you of people huh</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what reminds you of who?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...when i explored the incipisphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it was to find where to take quinn on our first date</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont worry too much about it</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but i still think about it sometimes</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: anything interesting about it?</span><br />
