<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, good news, I closed about 100 tabs worth of backlog. bad news, I didn't get around to drawing any gigapuase stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and ugly news, apparently there may or may not be a rat in the crawlspace under the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh man... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: avoid killing it for my sake</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dude just wants a place to live</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: release him into the wild sure but dont kill the poor thing for inconveniencing you</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: in other news: anyone here played final fantasy vi?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I know... we'll see what happens. I'm /hoping/ what it actually is is that Jasmine was actually hearing my fan and thought it was rat scratching for some reason...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, I can't figure out roman numerals this late at night... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because i am genuinely afraid of people like the chihiro trans brigade finding out about gog</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: *gogo</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: 6</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also released as 3 in america when it was originally on snes</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the one with terra and kefka</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah. I've played that one, most of the way through. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: did you get the secret characters? umaro and gogo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably not far enough to even meet them yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well gogo is a mimic character who can pick and choose other characters' special abilities and is specifically designed to be as vague as possible as a character</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the script goes out of its way to avoid giving gogo a gender</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: never let tumblr social justice activists play ff6</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: though to know if youve gotten to where you can meet gogo with minimal spoilers...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: did you reach the bit with celes and cid?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if you have you know exactly the one im talking about</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I'm trying to remember, it's been a while. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: after the floating continent</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im trying to avoid spoiling the event</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope, not there yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you should pick it back up</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: now, before someone spoils it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wish i had one of the twists thats coming be a surprise to me</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: once I get my wii hooked up again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: aw sweet you got the woolsey translation</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i was afraid you might have played the gba retranslation</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: which isnt /bad/ but hot damn the original snes translation was great</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow such meta <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCz3Z8JYSD8&feature=youtu.be'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCz3Z8JYSD8&feature=youtu.be</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: would you believe that kefka is universally considered a bland character in japan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also i thought you were going to bed cp</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hue</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah kefka as the darkly humorous mad clown was entirely a product of the localization team</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, didn't know that before.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: in the original japanese he just came off as a pure psychopath who made terrible attempts at humor</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like shitty puns mostly</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, I need to get a sensor bar replacement (might wind up rigging some remotes or a string of cheap lights) and I'll only be able to play downstairs in the living room because my room doesn't have a TV in it (my tv is in storage) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I really wish the menu allowed camecube controller suport. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *gamecube ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if you get a classic controller you dont need a sensor bar i dont think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: could be wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you can use its joystick just fine on the menu</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: on the wii main menu thing? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: plus the presence of a select button makes it better for vc games anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: by the way its been bothering me a bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: were you there when ash ragequit the incip memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sortakinda. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: do you think i was wrong to bring that up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me scroll up to see exactly what happened real quick... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: one or both of us was being an oversensitive shithead</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... personally, I think she was over-reacting to something that really didn't even warrent a flip-out like that. She tends to do that sometimes. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah but</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, whenever I get emotional, she yells at me. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: should i let that sort of thing get to me to begin with?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i get the same way when it comes to discussing... most of the cast of the avengers movies tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: male cast at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: should i be letting it get to me so much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (still typing) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I think it's okay to notice those sorts of things, but it's important to be able to focus on your own strengths. Sure, there's going to be plastic men that resemble some sort of ideal out there, but really, that doesn't say much about the person behind the plastic so much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but it still makes me feel really self-conscious yknow</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its like how i might drool over zooey deschanel when alone or when talking with other guys who also want to drool over zooey deschanel</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (zoosmell who?) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but im not going to sit in front of a girl who i know has body issues and start drooling over her</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shes an actress</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't really keep track of famous people all that much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me ask you a question: do you want to be consdered attractive? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: id like to be sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: id like to know that most people dont consider me ugly at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's understandable. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it can be hard to know what others think exactly, and you can't just change their opinions on the turn of a dime. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but you shouldn't let that affect how you feel about your self-image too much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (man, I'm really sucking at this advic thing, am I?) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but its particularly bad with some instances - and im not saying the bit on incip is one of them - when its someone i have a crush on gushing about how hot this other guy is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and no youre doing fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean when its someone i already dont think i have a chance with</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stating to make a bit more sense now... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and theyre talking about how hot tom goddamn hiddleston is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dunno i just have general feelings of inadequacy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like on some level it really made me happy to know people were upset i couldnt participate in closing the blue hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because it means im someone people think about, you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: right. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and im reflecting the hell out of that ic right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i really am scared that well all drift apart when the rp is over</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: since pathetic as it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm afraid of that a little bit too, but I know at least some of us will stick around. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this is the first place i feel like im important</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I know what you mean. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i feel like i could just lock myself in my room for the rest of my life and the only reason anyone would care is because i wouldnt be pulling my weight</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and its not even like a suicidal thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but here i actually feel important and needed</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fuck its 4 am and im barely coherent i know</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it completely makes sense. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like knowing i genuinely upset people with amy's death makes me really happy and not even in a sadistic way</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: (though thats part of it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just knowing that i crafted a story that genuinely affected pepople on an emotional level you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i never had that before</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, that PM RP thing with the hot cocoa was pretty awesome, and I really think it's cool how your character has spurred development with others. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shit just the fact that i have something im known for</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: the weird, vaguely body horror-y surrealist stuff i like</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that means more to me than you can imagine</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: is that silly of me?its not really even a positive thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it's wonderful. Like, you've obtained attention and you're being notied, and best of all: others still want to talk to you. It's a great feeling to be acknowledged. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and... was the hot cocoa thing really that great? it was mostly just me going through the motions tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I admit a lot of it was on my art, but it still had some effects afterwards. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *part ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its kind of funny, i mostly went into that to privately bash fl as a character</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but then that didnt work out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: things rarely go according to plan. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sbargv2 was the first rp i ever really participated in</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i saw it on the memo list after reading the sburb glitch faq</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and i was afraid it was going to be... well everything that comes to mind when you hear "homestuck roleplay</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i actually came on partially to troll everybody</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: on some level i still am</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i really dont know if ill ever find a group as great as this one</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can still remember that first meeting when everyone was showing off their selfies. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think i actually started that when i didnt have any art of my character</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, maybe not started it exactly, considering I'd been using a shooped photo of myself as a ref around that time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im really not a fan of projecting an idealized version of myself as a character unless its part of the setting</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im fat and neckbearded irl, i can be fat and neckbearded in the game too</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. being able to show flaws in characters while writing can really add another level of compellingness. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i think it helps keep me from a chris-chan situation where i have this version of myself thats such a painful form of hiding from who i really am</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: honestly chris-chan is one of the best things to happen to me motivation-wise</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it gave me something to strive to not be</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (wait, that's the sonichu guy, right?) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like i really feel like in some other timeline i could have been chris-chan</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I think it's about time for some sleep. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: guess its worth a shot</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...thanks for letting me talk to you about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you're welcome. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: goodnight! ➜</span><br />
