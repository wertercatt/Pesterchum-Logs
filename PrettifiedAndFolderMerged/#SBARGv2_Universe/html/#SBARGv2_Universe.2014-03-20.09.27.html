[03:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also! I'm hunting through Space for Miss Universe McSplodes.</span><br />
[03:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What, you /actually/ think she can pull it off?</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, stupid question</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: From the looks of it, yes.</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, maybe.</span><br />
[03:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's she up to right now?</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no idea! I'm only a tracker on land.</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, to get to full universe exploding mastery, she would need to absorb the powers of a void player to spawn in... oh fuck nuggets</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No Charles, no explosions.</span><br />
[03:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nobody is as big a munchkin as you.</span><br />

[03:53] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But all I found is some coordinates and some myth.</span><br />

[03:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it doesn't take a munchkin to think that antimatter would be good to blow shit up.</span><br />
[03:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Imagine trying to find a single fish in an endless ocean</span><br />

[03:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, she said she was from an Earth, from a universe neither this one nor our old one...</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Siiiiic }</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, which is where I was sorta looking</span><br />
[03:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You think she could be pre scratch?</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Instead I just jumped around a bunch of boring myth classes in random universities</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I highly doubt she could be from Beta Earth...</span><br />
[03:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You ever had a history lesson with a bunch of geeky aliens? Not fun.</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But she might be, and I know where to find more!</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay where are these aliens</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, not Beta Earth.</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: In space.</span><br />
[03:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, what are we looking for now?</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I wanna learn about history and stuff... since it would be new to me!</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean more information before the Earth thing</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We're looking for....FOR</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: A....A...</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Library.</span><br />
[03:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now excuse me as I try and see about making the Dakkagun.</span><br />
[04:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I guess if you find a planet with a school you can learn history Charles</span><br />
[04:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...gonna have to ask Gambit probably, she seems to have lockdown on all the library-planets' locations.</span><br />
[04:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good idea. Maybe.</span><br />
[04:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably.</span><br />
[04:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm currently thinking it would be some sort of Electromagnetic Rifle that would use the power from a golden hub to accelerate several metal slugs to relativistic speeds.</span><br />
[04:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Voiders are always so weird, I hate relying on them.</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, an Electromagnetic Chain Gun.</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's...actually a cool idea.</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: are we using the same laws of physics here</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: golden hub</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: what the fuck are you on about</span><br />
[04:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But yeah, I might have a lead on the Library to investigate</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: it sounds cool and all but the energy required to accelerate mass to relativistic speeds is just stupid</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh.</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Since MP was sleuthing and like, ragequit.</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: and like. a waste. not worthwhile at that point, considering guns are pretty much 'rooty tooty point and shooty' at this point</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just think like a Rail Gun thats combined with a Chain Gun.</span><br />
[04:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Guns are still cool, I'm proud of Charles for not being a huge loser.</span><br />
[04:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, since /supposedly/ magic and powers don't work on this Cal lady, we are gonna need to hit her fast and hard with something solid.</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Rock Beats Laser, basically?</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Shit, all the snowflakes from the session are screwed :v</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does anyone have any depleted uranium?</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Oddly enough, yeah</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........wat.</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have some leftover from the bee farms</span><br />
[04:05] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: have any of you nerds even used actual magic yet</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: like, against her</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have indeed. Not my cup of tea.</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: or just like your nonsense game powers.</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh not against her. We saw her like once though so</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Didn't test a lot.</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I tried a few brush techniques, which are technically legit magic... she shrugged them all off.</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats divine, not arcane.</span><br />
[04:06] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: so it's deriving power from your mana, yes?</span><br />
[04:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mana, ink pots, flower points, they're all the same stat basically.</span><br />
[04:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm mildly proud of being a Spacer and not actually using that many powers.</span><br />
[04:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((afk walking dog))</span><br />
[04:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I highly doubt that even the STRONGEST person in our session would be able to carry such a weapon however.</span><br />
[04:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But if we find anything in this library hell it could at least tell us how she's gonna do it.</span><br />
[04:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean most people don't say they're gonna destroy anything without a plan</span><br />
[04:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, you can look for this library then, I'll be getting this thing built. Maybe it can be a tank or something.</span><br />
[04:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or better yet, a fucking METAL GEAR.</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Try the tank</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: all the same shit?</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you'll think of something original</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((back))</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: sure, if you want to get your ass beat by an actual wizard</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: and have no counters to, y'know, people that derive energy from mana</span><br />
[04:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Bipedial doesn't really work to well.</span><br />
[04:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: too*</span><br />
[04:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Unless Rob does it</span><br />
[04:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Y'know</span><br />
[04:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, two legged machines usually have the problem of toppling over.</span><br />
[04:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I wonder if I need a library card</span><br />
[04:13] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or if I just have to walk in</span><br />
[04:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps a more spider tank would work better.</span><br />
[04:13] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: spider tank? sounds cool</span><br />
[04:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Those are the coolest</span><br />
[04:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I built a few lego robots when I was younger and the six-legged design is pretty stable if you do it right...</span><br />
[04:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually seen those in some planet's militaries</span><br />
[04:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Super creepy at higher speeds though ;;</span><br />
[04:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: question is, would I be able to get it to get where it needs to go?</span><br />
[04:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I /could/ try and see about finding the specs for some sort of jump drive.</span><br />
[04:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Jump as in, space travel?</span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah. Like, teleportation based.</span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Huh. Usually tanks don't have those at all.</span><br />
[04:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Most people just use carriers or vtols.</span><br />
[04:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Smaller ships drop the tanks off I mean.</span><br />
[04:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, whoooo wants to go exploring!</span><br />
[04:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heck yes I'm in</span><br />
[04:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: heck no I'm out</span><br />
[04:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why not FL?</span><br />
[04:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We might need a tank</span><br />
[04:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not going to go /exploring/.</span><br />
[04:28] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why not?</span><br />
[04:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, with my luck you would just awake /another/ ancient horror.</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I'm staying behind so you can't blame it on me.</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bleh... I see your logic.</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Did anybody ever blame you?</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually technically no.</span><br />
[04:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I thought you were easily the smarted one in the room</span><br />
[04:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Your paranoia was totally founded for once</span><br />
[04:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That could ACTUALLY be a useful exploring quality so we don't release anymore.</span><br />
[04:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which makes me a perfect target for paradox space to go after if it wants me dead.</span><br />
[04:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I'm starting to think it does.</span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Little bit too paranoid but good effort.</span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I need to stay back and make sure its completed.</span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: If it wants you dead it'd have killed you by now, I think.</span><br />
[04:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Tank, I mean.</span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ah. Well obviously not exploring tonight</span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or the MRFRG for short.</span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was thinking tomorrow so I could secure a camp</span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mobile Rapid Fire Rail Gun.</span><br />
[04:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, tomorrow would be good.</span><br />

[04:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, maybe the alien ants have a library.</span><br />

[10:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: However! I have a long list of reasonings and books with me that indicate this one is probably the one.</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Including but not limited to a book of myth from the same trading post I got the information to the FIRST cursed planet we went to.</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And another, smaller book to translate that one!</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: You seem to be 'covering your bases'</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((there's a chance I probably won't be able to show up due to obligitory job hunting and/or parents trying to keep me offline with chores -_-;))</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: My bases are covered like the most skilled baseball team!</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I'm about to hit a home run!</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { :c that sucks }</span><br />
[10:48] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This sounds likes a positive metaphor</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course it is, I'm so positive it's unpleasant!</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: How does positive lead to negative?</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because you can't be positive unless you've been negative!</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, granted, not in the world of electronics, but more in the realm of emotions.</span><br />
[10:51] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or the catharsis involved.</span><br />
[10:52] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I assume that I must take your word for it</span><br />
[10:54] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably!</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But this is definitely the one.</span><br />
[10:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I still have yet to figure out why a battery's "output" end is considered the negative end...</span><br />
[10:58] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Because whatever is using the energy is taking the positive energy</span><br />
[10:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because the positive side tastes the best, obviously.</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I do not understand</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The positive side of a battery has a nub, and you can check the charge by putting your tongue on it.</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: N_V ➜</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Your tongue tingles if there's still a charge, so the positive side "tastes" the best.</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: This is strange logic</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's a rule of thumb, not really actual logic</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: If I had a tongue i might have tested it</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'll lick some batteries for you.</span><br />
[11:03] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some more "rules of thumb but not actual logic", this building smells like evil.</span><br />
[11:04] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I do not understand.</span><br />
[11:04] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You ever smell something.</span><br />
[11:04] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: No</span><br />
[11:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: How is that even possible?</span><br />
[11:05] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: I have no lungs.</span><br />
[11:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I can assure you that sprites can smell</span><br />
[11:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'm not literally smelling anything</span><br />
[11:06] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((XD this is so confusing))</span><br />
[11:06] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((nix anything that was not correct then. replace with silence v.v))</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { whoops sorry }</span><br />
[11:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { I mean sprites can bleed so they definitely do have some measure of bodily function }</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Rather I'm taking a bunch of observations and various sights and my intuition tells me bad things. So, I smell it.</span><br />
[11:08] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((i thought that maybe since it was never protod with anything living it might not have blood v.v;))</span><br />
[11:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { At the very least, Jadesprite cries, logically you need some kinda bodily function to cry }</span><br />
[11:09] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { and she was a stuffed person }</span><br />
[11:09] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((still living at some point. can we stop talking about it? &gt;.&lt;))</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { sure, i was just throwin out random things anyhoo }</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((sprites tend to take on the qualities of the concepts behind the prototyped items rather than jst the literal qualities))</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((take that how you will, I'm definately not an expert))</span><br />
[11:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((well here's something. Ammysprite was also prototyped with a plush toy, and was a living, breathing sprite BEFORE Kim self-protoed.))</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Deerscope sprite had a telescope for a head. }</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { ....I don't know if it could breath. }</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so there is in fact precedent for the idea of something being more important than literal aspects))</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((even though i asked for it to be DROPPED. fine. whatever))</span><br />
[11:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { We're just throwin around sprite stories m8 }</span><br />
[11:13] <span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: ((no...you're throwing around sprite theories based on the conversation I asked to be dropped and discarded))</span><br />
[11:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { riiiight okay }</span><br />
[11:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe this yellow stuff is toxic.</span><br />
[11:19] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[11:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat</span><br />
[11:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ..Nothin.</span><br />
[11:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also it's late, I'm out, peace.</span><br />
[11:32] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[11:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((back))</span><br />
[11:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((...I appear to have missed everything and caused somebody to get angry))</span><br />
