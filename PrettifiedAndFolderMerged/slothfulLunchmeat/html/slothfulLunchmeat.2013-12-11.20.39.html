[08:39:57] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: ((ooc))</span><br />
[08:40:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: what</span><br />
[08:40:10] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: do i have permission to have sl be affected by the dogscape?</span><br />
[08:40:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: no</span><br />
[08:40:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: (thats not what the uh oh in the memo was about)</span><br />
[08:40:22] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: ok</span><br />
[08:40:33] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: like, by the bite?</span><br />
[08:40:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: because its not big enough</span><br />
[08:40:40] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: i guess you have plans for it</span><br />
[08:40:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: You would have needed to be completely absorbed.</span><br />
[08:41:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Then again, the drool is likely absorbing tiny insects...</span><br />
[08:41:19] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: well i was thinking more with his bionic arm being a biological abomination of its own</span><br />
[08:41:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: have you seen akira?</span><br />
[08:41:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: no not really</span><br />
[08:42:04] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL:  <a href='http://www.citizenga.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_m08jplY2y11rqzfqho1_1280.gif'>http://www.citizenga.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_m08jplY2y11rqzfqho1_1280.gif</a></span><br />
[08:42:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: WHY</span><br />
[08:42:21] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: i basically am thinking of the bite making this happen</span><br />
[08:42:26] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: because its /awesome/ and freaky</span><br />
[08:42:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well uh...</span><br />
[08:42:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: only if it comes back</span><br />
[08:42:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: after absorbing more biomass.</span><br />
[08:42:53] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: fair enough</span><br />
[08:43:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: as it can only absorb things smaller than itself, and it can't paradoxify new biomass anymore.</span><br />
[08:43:09] <span style="color:#2d8a18">SL: do i have permission to foreshadow it at least?</span><br />
[08:43:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: sure</span><br />
