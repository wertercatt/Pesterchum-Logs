<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Its basically a machine to harness the latent power of one's aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I feel like their is a hidden something(sub-aspect) within a person's aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: *there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Except the machine either does some trippy thing or the effect doesn't stay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm basically making everything to super power people's aspects</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I got the machine put together</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: except tuning it and getting it to the right number of volts has been hard</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: right now its tuned at...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that still doesn't answer why I started smelling purple after your second test...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: 9.345</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: probably a trippy side effect</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: the main effect was that the piece of rubble I shot at sped up through time</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: until the very end of time</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: at which point it again became an object, briefly supported life before ending up as the rubble that I originally saw</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: then that just continued until I shut the thing off</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: this thing fucks up reality sometimes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I created a doppleganger while tuning it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: w-was it made of candy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: thing nearly killed me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and no</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: /phew/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: it was made of my immense hate for experimentation </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that's not even a joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you accidentally a Saccarine Doppleganger, I was going to come over and punch you into the Beforan Session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: How about I take the thingymapoop from the frayamp</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and use that to jump start it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: okay it seems to be stable</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I think the thing might be good</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Now I need to attatch this to the Skaialite </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: CP, are you capable of using your aspect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: doing the Lighty Thing? yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: do the lighty thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I want to see if it works on you</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: should I come over or...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: just tell me what happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I might ask you to come over, later for further testing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but for now, you can stay home</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: just do the lighty thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, Issun and Kutone are playing Mario Party in the living room, this oughta work...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I definitly made a LoCaC</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but I think its a doomed timeline LoCaC</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, that would make sense actually. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Meaning</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: That in a doomed timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I never made progress on my planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: which would mean I either left or died</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: if I left, why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm searching for my body</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: not much progress has been made</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Somehow</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: a bomb came onto the planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: a big bomb</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: not tumor big</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but still pretty big</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I've got 3 days</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I can either disarm the thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that makes since</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I think</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: oh damn</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I think touching it was a bad idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: 15 minutes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: to move this thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: to god knows where</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I guess I could further doom a doomed timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: why not</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: poop</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: *poof</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: its gone</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and some other doomed LOCAC is sploding</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Its a familiar LoCaC actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It was one of the first doomed timelines I ever saw</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: They pulled a Jade </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and so their session was basically nerfed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so this probably ended up in the middle of nowhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: infact</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: depending on the power of the explosion</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we might get some fireworks</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I doubt its that powerful</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: thats green sun level power</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but the horrorterrors might get a show</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: also, they might need...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: fire fighters</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm pretty sure explosions don't leak through timelines. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because the bomb might have ended up in the space in the furthest ring</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: where the session used to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and the time and space wierdness of the furthest ring</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and blah blah blah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: But if there are any horrorterrors occupying that space, they're dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or on fire</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or dead and on fire</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: can horrorterrors die?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes. very yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Also, what if they meet other session people</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: remember [S] Caliborn: Enter?</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: ('~')</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Were they dead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Or injured</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because they're gods</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so they might just be immortal</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nakkerterror friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I wonder what we'll do after the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: When we make the new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: bring naksorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I don't want to be a cat forever</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'll be sure to try and bring some consorts, no worries Nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: most naksorts on nak boats</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'd never leave those guys on purpose </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: they get seats on the senate of the new planet we choose to inhabit </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I have a great number of plans for the new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AC, I... don't think Animal Tiering goes away.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: damn</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though who knows, maybe genetics shenans might help, if you really want to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I think I might live with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: i'm too lazy to do shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: bring ecto lab</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: god, i've been too busy being a nerd to focus on who i'm going to go with after the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I don't really have any close friends here</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: as for me, I'm just fine with being part wolf...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that's good </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Do you think there will be humans</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I hope there are humans</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or something physiologically similar to them</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there probably won't be, other than ourselves... the dominant species of a universe is always different than the players that made it, and they have to repopulate on their own (well, with ectobabbies to help but)</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: humans be nakstinct</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but then</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that means I have to make relationships with team mates</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: groooan</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: new game not start until old race gone probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: sigh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: maybe we should keep a new game from happening...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: This shits too annoying </span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: inakvetible</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we'll just have to be there to destroy the game whenever it appears</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: also, seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: do I have to get with one of the team mates</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I hope that means "no, you can get with an alien"</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: naksort????????????????????????????????????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if the group was smaller, yes. but since we have a decently large group that will be going through the end game door... eh, probably still should.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: naksorts even go through door?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: If I had the power, I would go back in time to make sure that I knew how to mingle and shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though... I haven't checked for sure, and don't plan to anytime soon... but the hybrid dna of Animal Tier players may or may not result in [DATA EXPUNGED] babies</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: ask ornak</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so would my child be a cat</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because that's wierd shit, bro</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Nak, I'd rather not ask him...</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak ask ornak</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: cat problem lame</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: besides, easy way to check: paradoxify yourself and see what the result is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you can't make a Perfect Clone of yourself because your dna at birth is different than what it is now, so in theory it's safe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Groan</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: still make baby</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: let's see if I can just make a paradoxifier </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I don't want to go out to the veil</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that shit's too far</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Man...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: reproduction is an annoying thing in Sburb</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: as for me, best-case scenario is that my ectokid turns out to be Chibiterasu (or like him). worst-case, it ends up a textbook werewolf that transforms on the Prospitian eclipse cycle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I need to pay more attention to girls in the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because I don't want a fucking chibicat child</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: also because that's still wierd shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: so who're the girls in this session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: (\/)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: before you ask, no, I'm not interested in toy. ➜</span><br />
