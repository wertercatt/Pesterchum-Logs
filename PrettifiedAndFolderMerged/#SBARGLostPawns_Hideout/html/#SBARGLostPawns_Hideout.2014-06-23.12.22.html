[13:45:57] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or we just caused a time paradox</span><br />

[13:46:59] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: didn't think about that</span><br />
[13:47:10] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: makes sense, kind of</span><br />

[13:48:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i'm just pulling at straws</span><br />
[13:48:24] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: sense he's a time player</span><br />
[13:48:29] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: he's a serial killer</span><br />
[13:48:32] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: GT revival tends to malfunction or be outright disabled in doomed timelines, or so I've heard... and several of us have respawned fine lately.</span><br />
[13:48:38] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and he pleaded the fifth on being on his way to another session</span><br />
[13:49:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Lets just shoot him in the head and see if he dies a just death.</span><br />
[13:49:18] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: nah</span><br />
[13:49:20] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if he does do that</span><br />
[13:49:25] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and it is Chronos</span><br />
[13:49:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: shit is gonna get fucked</span><br />
[13:49:31] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:49:42] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: So you would rather /let him go/?!</span><br />
[13:49:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we need to figure out a way to keep shit from getting fucked</span><br />
[13:50:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: without letting him fuck with our shit</span><br />
[13:50:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I think finding a time player would be key</span><br />
[13:50:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Okay, here is the plan.</span><br />
[13:50:45] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but as it stands, I don't think we should risk killing him</span><br />
[13:50:49] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: We have a time player on the sidelines, and if we start dying after we shoot him in the head, he goes back to stop us.</span><br />
[13:51:08] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: yeah</span><br />
[13:51:15] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or we find some way to rewrite history</span><br />
[13:51:19] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so that when we kill him</span><br />
[13:51:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if its Chronos</span><br />
[13:51:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: a paradox won't occur</span><br />
[13:51:49] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ...actually, that's impossible.</span><br />
[13:52:05] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: the entire Post-Scratch session depends on him existing.</span><br />
[13:52:39] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: KICK LOGIC AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE</span><br />
[13:52:41] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: and things that are depended on for a session to happen tend to be the stickier Fixed Points In Time...</span><br />
[13:52:48] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: THAT'S HOW TEAM DAI GURREN ROLLS</span><br />
[13:52:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: So its either a doomed version, or we throw him into space and /fly away/ while he is tied up and bound.</span><br />
[13:53:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so then</span><br />
[13:53:20] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: eh, also true</span><br />
[13:53:23] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: do we let him fuck our session up?</span><br />
[13:53:27] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: wait</span><br />
[13:53:43] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but if that's what he meant when he said we'd eventually have to die</span><br />
[13:53:52] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: why did he stab me last night?</span><br />
[13:54:00] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I seriously doubt it was just because I provoked him.</span><br />
[13:55:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Lets find a time player and rock paper scissors to decide who shoots him in the head.</span><br />
[13:55:46] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: yeah</span><br />
[13:56:03] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: shit</span><br />
[13:56:07] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: now that I think about it</span><br />
[13:56:16] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what if this is part of a paradox that already occured</span><br />
[13:56:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and this is just some kind of repeat of the events that unfolded as a result of it</span><br />
[13:58:54] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: anyway</span><br />
[13:58:57] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we got him</span><br />
[13:59:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so that's cool</span><br />
[13:59:47] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we also started discussing ways to get a better ISP</span><br />
[14:00:53] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: welp</span><br />
