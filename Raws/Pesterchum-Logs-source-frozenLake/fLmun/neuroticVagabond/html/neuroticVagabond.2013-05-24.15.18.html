<span style="color:#005500">NV: Yes yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">NV: Tell me all about the details of this mental battle?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Do not tell the guardian.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">NV: Noted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I did not fight him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I talked with him, and he gave me the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">NV: Well that sounds simple</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">NV: You just talked?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And he told me not to tell the guardian.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, it was more like he asked for something from me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'm not exactly sure what he took.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">NV: Your LIFE with this METEOR</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I knew that fighting him would mean death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I don't think it was the denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I think the guardian might have found out, and is punishing me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have about 40 minutes, that should be enough time to redirect it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">NV: Alright, that makes sense</span><br />
