[12:59:31] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: we need to seige LoTaL</span><br />
[12:59:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CONNECTION</span><br />
[12:59:48] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: eh?</span><br />
[12:59:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOU ARE A PIECE OF SHIT</span><br />
[12:59:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: AC, are you sure we need to leeroy jenkins our way there? ➜</span><br />
[12:59:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FUCK YOU CONNECTION</span><br />
[12:59:59] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yes, SJ</span><br />
[01:00:05] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that's exactly what we're going to do</span><br />
[01:00:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[01:00:11] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that's like... only partially a joke</span><br />
[01:00:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … AC. Have you ever been to LOTAL?</span><br />
[01:00:17] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Yes</span><br />
[01:00:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably only yesterday. ➜</span><br />
[01:00:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[01:00:30] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: yeah</span><br />
[01:00:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, I'll stay on this one</span><br />
[01:00:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Great. So I assume you know all about the security precautions and how to bypass them?</span><br />
[01:00:55] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: not how to bypass them</span><br />
[01:01:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But you know about every single one of the precautions?</span><br />
[01:01:10] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: we're likely going to do a full on seige, guns ablazing...</span><br />
[01:01:16] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: AC, no. ➜</span><br />
[01:01:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[01:01:32] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Yeah, nah</span><br />
[01:01:34] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: we aren't doing that</span><br />
[01:01:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if you do that, I'm...</span><br />
[01:01:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh thank god</span><br />
[01:01:49] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: but we probably will be either seiging or getting past the security some how</span><br />
[01:02:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Right! That would /definitely/ help out /on LOTAL/! An approach with absolutely no stealth or subtlety is required!</span><br />
[01:02:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean except for the part where it wouldn't and isn't.</span><br />
[01:02:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was going to say if you did that, I would just give you the code for buckybombs and let you do it.</span><br />
[01:02:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog no ➜</span><br />
[01:02:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dear sweet jesus fuck.</span><br />
[01:02:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it seems my point has been made.</span><br />
[01:03:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So. Is Athena helping EQ? On EQ's side?</span><br />
[01:03:22] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: anyway...</span><br />
[01:03:29] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So that we'll logically have to get through Athena as well?</span><br />
[01:03:34] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: EQ is trusting her denizen</span><br />
[01:03:38] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: that's all I need to know</span><br />
[01:03:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ...</span><br />
[01:03:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, AC. It /really really isn't/.</span><br />
[01:03:58] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: the goal is to kill Athena, I thought...</span><br />
[01:04:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I will protect this planet from /you/ if I have to.</span><br />
[01:04:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: There are /already plans in place/.</span><br />
[01:04:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[01:04:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait there are?</span><br />
[01:04:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay then</span><br />
[01:04:29] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: oh god damnit</span><br />
[01:04:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll just leave you to it</span><br />
[01:04:35] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: does this mean we have to worry about AG?</span><br />
[01:04:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Smart move, FL.</span><br />
[01:04:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, lets just hang back.</span><br />
[01:04:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And let AG handle it.</span><br />
[01:04:51] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: AG, what are your plans</span><br />
[01:05:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: None of your goddamn business.</span><br />
[01:05:02] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ancient chinese secret. ➜</span><br />
[01:05:02] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I can't hang back until I know what you're planning</span><br />
[01:05:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if she needs the code for the bucky bombs, I can give that to her.</span><br />
[01:05:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You're a liability and a moron.</span><br />
[01:05:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AG, that could be applied to me as well, but at least I realize that and I'm not asking for your plan, which knowledge of would likely ruin.</span><br />
[01:05:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm proud of you for that, FL.</span><br />
[01:06:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, we need to know as /little as possible/ if this is going to work.</span><br />
[01:06:07] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I can't hang back until I know your plan</span><br />
[01:06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[01:06:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then I'll take steps to eliminate you as a variable, if I have to.</span><br />
[01:06:31] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ...</span><br />
[01:06:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, don't make me kiss you again.</span><br />
[01:06:40] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: AG, tell me the god damn plan</span><br />
[01:06:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm already involved in this plotline. I've been setting things up for far too long to have it ruined by an incompetent moron.</span><br />
[01:06:55] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: FL... if you do I will throw you so far foward in time there will be no more time for you to be thrown to</span><br />
[01:06:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Which you are/.</span><br />
[01:07:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ha</span><br />
[01:07:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hahaha</span><br />
[01:07:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: AC, I can actually go that far and get him back. ➜</span><br />
[01:07:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would like to see you try.</span><br />
[01:07:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
[01:07:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And like... I've been to the end of time before.</span><br />
[01:07:47] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'll be sure to throw him right back</span><br />
[01:07:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's pretty quiet there. ➜</span><br />
[01:08:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It really isn't that bad to be honest.</span><br />
[01:08:16] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: I'll make you play Sanic 06</span><br />
[01:08:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus uh... after you threw me, I would know exactly where you...</span><br />
[01:08:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hahaha</span><br />
[01:08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats usually /my/ threat.</span><br />
[01:08:36] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: AG, I just hope you don't fail</span><br />
[01:08:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah. I hope I don't either.</span><br />
[01:09:01] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: If you fail, i'm executing my plan</span><br />
[01:09:07] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: you ought to execute it soon</span><br />
[01:09:19] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: the closer we get to the end of the session the more room there is for disaster</span><br />
[01:09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You ought to shut up and not tell me what to do.</span><br />
[01:09:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets play Sonic 06 coop, except I have to get through as sonic while you try to kill me as Silver.</span><br />
[01:09:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It will be /fun/</span><br />
[01:09:39] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: Sexy... </span><br />

[01:10:57] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: anyway, AG, every second closer we get to the end</span><br />
[01:11:01] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: the more room there is for failure</span><br />
