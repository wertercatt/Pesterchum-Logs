[06:47] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT ChanServ [CCC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

[06:47] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Time is also about patience and destruction. You're somewhat impatient at times and manage to be the one to "heal" your comrads both physicaly and mentally when the Time calls for it. Σ</span><br />
[06:47] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: whats up</span><br />
[06:47] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Heya Σ</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#5c315c">CURRENT melodiousPsyche [CMP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I do?</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Huh.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: wow that auctaully fits why im so impatient</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: /suhrg.txt</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: He's doing a Title explanation for me. It's pretty cool.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Like when you showed up just in the nick of time to help your friends after I had that episode. Σ</span><br />
[06:49] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I was contacted about the situation.</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Being a Prince is all about using your aspect to destroy your aspect. You fight uncertainty and inevitability with your own timing. Σ</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but you just so happened to be on at the Time and immediately moved to help when called to do so. Σ</span><br />
[06:51] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Huh...</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: coool</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As for CP, you weaponize Light for yourself. This means using your knowledge and luck for your own gain. Its noted though that Knights don't really start out with a lot of their element and have to grow into using it mroe effectively. Σ</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: [[ i thought CP was a Witch? ]]</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ...is a Witch of Light... --</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Thanks CA.</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#008282">[CCA]</span>  had that wroooooooooong then --</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  SORE WA CHIGAU YO --</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  SLAPS ROB --</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  THAT FIT PERFECTLY AND YOU KNOW IT --</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ok so for you CP you actively change Light. Light being the aspect of luck and knowledge. Σ</span><br />
[06:57] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ What I've noticed is that people tend to rely on your to change things in their favor. Your portals are vital to dungeoneering and you work on changing the level of knowledge of everyone by actively seeking new things. Σ</span><br />
[06:58] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ You are all about change and are active in seeing that change through. Σ</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do me next</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Heh</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Spaaaaaaace Σ</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Space is a tricky one</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup, sounds about rig-- pfffffffft</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's see how you play this one out Reid</span><br />
[07:00] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well Space is all about creation, being the polar opposite of Time, and it's all about movement and position of objects. </span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  waits --</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  waits for the chance to show off the Sweet Loot he made --</span><br />
[07:02] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well not all about that but it's the main thing. Matter and such. </span><br />
[07:02] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ To be honest your role is somewhat similar to Jade's. Space is all about, as MP said, creation, spatial distance, the actual location of something, with minor emphasis on size and velocity. But added onto that is the idea of self image and pieces of things as well which ties into it's social aspect. Σ</span><br />
[07:03] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yay I was right about that!</span><br />
[07:03] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: K sorry go on.</span><br />
[07:04] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  causually tries to hack the chumplist --</span><br />
[07:04] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  fails miserbly --</span><br />
[07:04] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#830000">CURRENT naK [CNK]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[07:04] <span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak?</span><br />
[07:04] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I've noticed that as the game has gone on you've been willing to change yourself (be it through actions, tactics, or what have you) to meet the goals you have set for yourself. You have also actively worked to change others (though not always successfully) and how they view themselves and others. You tend to be abel to piece things together quite well and are able to create new ideas and plans from the</span><br />
[07:04] <span style="color:#008282">smallest scraps of information. Σ</span><br />
[07:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  thinks CA has this all written out --</span><br />
[07:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd like some more substantial evidence to them accusations, but I'd have to say you're sounding more accurate than I gave you credit for.</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: The second part is definitely a thing.</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0000ff">CURRENT blueBassist [CBB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Third part also yes, first part is... I can see it.</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ For an example of the *changing how others see things* I'll point to your plan a while back with Rob. You guys tried to use how people see you and him as a way of hiding your plans until you could act on them. Σ</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...What are we talking about now?...</span><br />
[07:06] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Title interpretations and how we act like our title.</span><br />
[07:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well shit.</span><br />
[07:07] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Might as well ask...</span><br />
[07:07] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Forgot about being a manipulative bastard.</span><br />
[07:07] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...What about Rogue of Breath?...</span><br />
[07:07] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ :V Σ</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: I might as well ask, Witch of Time</span><br />

[07:08] <span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ Heyo</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ So many....... Σ</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ But ok V: Σ</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Congrats, John, you're popular.</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I mean hey these are pretty cool.</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd pick up the slack, but it sounds less professional coming from a Witch of Space :u</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Heh</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Being able to understand people is a curse man. Σ</span><br />
[07:08] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Totally.</span><br />
