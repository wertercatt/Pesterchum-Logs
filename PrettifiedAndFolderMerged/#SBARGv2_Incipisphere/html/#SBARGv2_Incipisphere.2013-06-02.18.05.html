<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Man, just tune into the Chumosphere and search around a bit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't think I want to, I'm quickly coming to the conclusion I've overdosed on the social aspect of this session. And here I was hoping to not dread spending the rest of time with these people.</span><br />
