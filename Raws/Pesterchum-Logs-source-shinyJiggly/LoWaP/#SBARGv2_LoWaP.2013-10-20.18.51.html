<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm still wondering how 895 affected you when normally it only mindfucks recordings...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, thats part of what CA and I (hopefully) figure out soon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: CP, SJ, it's… not going to be exciting to watch.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#008282">[CCA]</span>  looks at it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a8a87a">[CFF]</span>  it's a book "Programming for Dummies". it looks slighty charred. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: So...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ You were learning programming? Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: ...t</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Trying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: More of a HardWare guy- always building stuff in the basement but... Not that good at programming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I understand. I had a similar problem myself. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Good idea. Please do so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87a">CFF: Why is Sticky Note Girl here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Currently we know that the memories of 895 are what drove him insane and that the memories from there on out are what have probably effected his personality Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  begins walking towards the door --</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ My idea is to isolate all the memories from the moment FF went into 895's room to now and destroy them. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: Yeah... It's As if for him... Reality Makes No sense, or Reality makes sense for him, but in a sideways kind of wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Bad news is he won't remember the last few days but good thing is he might not be insane Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is this possible just by wandering around? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a8a87a">[CFF]</span>  you are just in his spire, SJ. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: ...You Sure? He... well, he feels that memories are IMPORTANT. he may fight you a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: We Feel that Memories are what makes you...well, you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've tried to talk to him about this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT circuitousAntipathy <span style="color:#008282">[CCA]</span>  points at FF. "Is this him better than how he was before?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#03a101">CFD: ...Yeah. True. You can do it but... be careful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  eventually finds the exit after enough wandering around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I plan to. I'm not some kinda stone cold machine here. I'm going to be as gentle as possible Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  hops up and begins flying away, is this possible? or are there obstacles? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishDream <span style="color:#03a101">[CFD]</span>  ... I am tempted to have you ambushed by spider consorts, but no, you are free to go. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  only got here so easily because I was blindly following CP though a brushportal --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  eventually leaves --</span><br />
