<div class=memolog>
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 LOFAR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is slowly moving torward the house... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  welcome to NV's ridiculously upgraded and essentially Foundation level home/facility, featuring an astronomy tower, laboratories, a firing range, a fantastic new fountain, and a few new garages positioned around the lush garden forest its nestled in. The door is open. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  flips through his visors, trying to search for traps. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  Not a single trap, except for the golem guards shambling around perfectly harmlessly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly moves torward the entrance... and scans the doorway. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  it's a door --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  congratulations --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly walks into the building, ready to react, if say, the door slams shut behind him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  the door politely closes behind him. Except it doesn't because it's just a door. You've entered the main hallway, the living room off to the side, full of books, wooden boxes, and clutter, wires hanging from a few holes in the ceiling, books and more clutter and metal scrap littering the main hallway. Small robots putt around the house whirring and clicking, organizing and stacking things for NV. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  scans the robots. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  they're harmless robots powered by denizen-tech --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  scans the wires. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  enters NV's dwelling citadel, closing the door behind him since someone left it open --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  spins to face CP. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: !... oh, hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hi</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just came to check this place out</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  the connection is definitely deeper into the house. The door hits the frame and slowly bounces open. Locks are broken. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I had no idea NV had enough build grist for a Dwelling CITADEL........</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  seriously this house is SCP Foundation level size and tech --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  ridiculous shit right here --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  too much free time prime example --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *noticing the door* ...hold on a second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  switchs to the ECHO Visor, and does a brief search of the enviornment. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  thinks he smells something suspicious coming from a nearby room... but it turns out to just be a bunch of vases --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT issunJar [CIJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: "It's our mortal enemy... POTTERY!" That's what you're thinking, isn't it? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: kinda...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  vases yo, they have some smells. The lock appears to have been expertly removed, clearly intentional, the door just kind of hangs open 24/7. The environment is pretty empty besides signs of at least two people living here, the robots, and other usual things. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys, don't break the pots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm gonna look for NV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  switches to the Thermal Visor, attempting to get NV's heat signature. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: must... resist... wolf... instincts...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  fails to resist the urge, but smashes pottery from his own sylladex instead --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  there's his heat signature just bouncing around the house, it's deeper in the citadel. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, if I don't come back in an hour, I need you to run to the HQ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't use pesterchum, it might not be secure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  runs deeper into the citadel. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  You've entered the kitchen, welcome to the real party. It's just a nice contemporary kitchen renovated to look incredibly nice, toasters are all over the place, watching FL like tiny metal sentinels. You have reached a T! Available pathways: Enter the kitchen by going left, enter the lounge room by going right, or go back two feet, and open the door to your left. There is also a door opposite the door two feet away, as --</span><br />
well as a door between the lounge and kitchen.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((you went past the length limit O_O))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Yes whatever it happens literally all the time }</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  examines the door between the lounge and kitchen. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  bathroom :v --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  you've encountered a DALEK IN THE BATHROOM. What do you do? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *close the door close the door close the door!*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  uses Golden Fury on the eyestalk! it's super effective! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  the door is closed. The Dalek is startled that it was interrupted while changing its oil, but is otherwise indifferent. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks the door backwards to the right. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  you've discovered a closet! You've engaged in battle with the AGITATED MOTH. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  attempts to smack the moth out of the air with his two hands. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT issunJar <span style="color:#39b873">[CIJ]</span>  jumps up and perforates the moth using Denkomaru --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  the moth is smacked. The moth is dead. Do you feel good about yourself now, murderer? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  The moth is sliced in half. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  Both players gain +.5 experience. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  The closets contents are now unlocked! You've gained access to: Vaccuum Cleaner, Umbrella, assorted coats, and a kite. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  opens the other door, not caring about the moth. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  You've opened the door to the Basement! A foreboding feeling comes out of it. Or maybe that's just the smell of incense. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  An ~ominous~ light eminates from the basement. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  turns to walk away, but manages to slip on a fragment of vase that made it... rather far. HE WAS TOLD ABOUT STAIRS. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  winces at the smell, his canine nose having a strong dislike of foreboding incense --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  You roll down the fluffy padded stairs, quite comfortably actually, and land safely in the basement! The foreboding smell was actually incense burning! The foreboding light was just christmas lights suspended from the ceiling! You've entered the PARTY PAD. Immediately visible is a fully stocked bar, a pool table, bookshelves, and off to the side is a large ring of couches and assorted fancy chairs near a stereo, a poke --</span><br />
table in the center. Echidna is sitting on a couch reading a book.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........wait, huh? the denizen lives in the dwelling citadel's basement????????</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly gets up, glances around for NV, and climbs back up the stairs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT issunJar <span style="color:#39b873">[CIJ]</span>  ogles the sake bottles at the bar --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (hey. no. I am not having you get drunker than Susano right now.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has an INTENSE STAREDOWN with... Echidna's decorational sense --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  Echidna is in the form of a girl looking quite youthful, maybe her late 20's, with long raggedy grey hair with blue tips, a dress with roughly a couple more pockets, pouches, and slings than it needs making up her SMITHING SMOCK. Overall, she looks to be a very odd person, if not a bit ditzy. She likes the pretty lights. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is checking the kitchen now. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has strongjumped up a few more rungs on the confusion echeladder --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  the kitchen is a kitchen. There's food and drinks in the refridgerator, a pantry, a few cupboards, and an electric stove. Also like 40 toasters still. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: must... resist... reference... urge...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks the lounge room. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  fails to resist the urge, and puts toast in all the toasters before turning all of them on --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  somewhere in the distance, you can hear somebody shout "WHO WANTS TOAST..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks around for the source of the noise. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  lounge room has couches, a tv, and a table. A laptop sits on the tablet, closed, along with a few cans of Coke. The noise seems to have come from nowhere. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...gog dammit, where is NV?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks to see if there is a second floor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  There was a staircase in the main hallway heading upstairs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  climbs up the stairs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher's <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP'S]</span>  hacker instincts kick in and he checks the laptop for open programs and/or memos --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  The computer is locked when you open it, a password is required! Hint: My name is _________. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  Upstairs, there are 5 different doors. 1 of them appears to be an elevator. The other 4 are closed. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just decides to go with plan b. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  attempts to type "nico", but fat-paws it and it comes out "nmiocvop" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bluh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  runs off to look for other things --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  Password denied! There's a lamp, if that helps. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads back down to the lounge. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  comes down the stairs after like five minutes, an ice pack on his head, heading into the lounge room. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What are you two even doing in my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I just explained my reasoning, so first I'm going to do this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a spray bottle and squirts NV with some water. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And then leave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  starts walking out the door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm just bored and decided to go land-jumping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  attempts to punt FL straight out of the house. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is accelerated out of the house by NV. --</span><br />
