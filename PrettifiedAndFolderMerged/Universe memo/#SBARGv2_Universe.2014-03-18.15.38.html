<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: What happens after you stop?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Do you disappear?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Or just float there</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: all willy nilly</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: If Sburb, Sgrub, Sumth, Shusk, and every incarnation never happen again...I stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: And then I'm free to do whatever I want.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Settle down in a backwater planet, start a family.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Well. That settles it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Looks like we need to go Frog temple Hunting in this universe.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Most definitely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: It's really easy to gather an army when you tell them the alternative is well...living out the rest of their days in a ticking time bomb of a frog..</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: So really, you just want to break free.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: You want to break free.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Fight the power, man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Bingo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: You want to break free from their lies, they're so self-satisfied you don't need them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: God knows. God knows you want to break free.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I doubt it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Well. I did challenge a gamble/</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I still doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Do you know what a Bard of Void is hun?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: How'd you even get yourself into this sticky wicket, right here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: No, I have no idea what a bard of void is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Shutup and go talk to somebody who has the crayons to translate for you, holy shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: And how I got myself into this situation would be longer to explain than it's worth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Bard of Void means I invite the descrution of the void and unknown. In a way, I put light on generally completely unknown things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: Well, honestly, you're going to end their lives. You owe them some sort of explanation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: I have information.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: However, the opposite is also true of my powers.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I see you typing but I'm painfully aware only half the things you say actually ever needed to be said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: Either way, I'm gonna get going. Shoot me a warning when you start killing everything. I need my great-grandson out of this shithole at that point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a556b9">CWG: Much appreciated in advance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I mean it's actually sad watching you fit all of your wit into a few sentences.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Yeah I'll let you know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Or maybe he will, who knows!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: I feel like im being underestimated.</span><br />

<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Have you found all of them in any other universe?</span><br />

<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Got a rough estimate of that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Let's call it once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: And how many were in there?</span><br />

<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Give me a rough number.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: How about I put it at 1,234.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Alright. 47 out of 1234. For a whole universe, thats not that big of a number. Of course, finding them is the tricky part as you know.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Just get to the point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. a needle in a legendary infinite haystack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: What if you had the opprotunity to have 1234 simultaneous ways to do it all at once?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Personally, I like the destruction, it helps the pain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: You're gonna go off and ruin a bunch of temples. I have the locations or know how to find them all at once, and you can go on your merry way to freedom without bothering us ever again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: What'd ya say?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: So you'd willingly let me prevent SBURB from ever happening again in this universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: No skin off my back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I mean really you're doing the universe a favor, I'm the real hero here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you want to think of it that way, go ahead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: You don't even know my perspective on these things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: Or why I'm doing it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because being kicked into other aspects against your will has broken your sanity?</span><br />

<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: Your choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00bcbc">CDT: I could just give this universe another vast croak and that would do it.</span><br />
