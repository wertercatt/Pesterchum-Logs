<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably late afternoon would be good</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know right now that its gonna be a lootless dungeon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I /could/ use heart powers to check the loot for lich soul.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: do what now FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i wouldnt recommend trying to do anything with that dungeon unless you can send your heartself or whatever with a sword</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Naw.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not trained in /that/ kind of heart powers.</span><br />

<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I wonder if I could eat a lich soul...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm more of a person who exchanges soul, sometimes with others, and at other times, for power.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: liches dont have souls do they?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats kind of the whole point?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, normally I would advice against that, but now I don't really care.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: They have those, phyla things that I can't spell for the life of me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought the whole thing was /those/ were their souls. Or contained their souls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: liches are basically what fl just described himself as</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: platypus???</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: exchanging souls for power</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah except most times its usually my soul.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what liches do</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im scare</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess you are right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: fl are you coming out as a lich</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He doesn't keep his soul in something other then his body.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No magic or anything, either</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: he uses science instead of magic</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its still mostly dark science</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...literally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, either I switch souls around, or burn portions of my own soul up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it all comes together</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((okay, looks like the doctor who special goes to 4:10pm EST tomorrow, so... any time after 4:30 EST would be fine with me... even starting at 4pm if necessary))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Clarke's third law.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((which I need to remember is 1pm /my/ time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: this makes too much sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I don't have to murder to move my soul to something else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: heart lame</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i love you nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You could say that about any aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well life actually is lame so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's true. all aspects have their weak points...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And so is void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: void rad</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering they are weak against sensory attacks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: void is the most op aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its clearly unfinished</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, they still see and hear, and that can be used against them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With Seisure Grenades for example.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or perhaps you could overload them by using that one sonic thing in Iron Man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you mean the music from HOW 2 DRAW SANIC HEGEHOG</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNK</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the one that Stane used on Tony to basically knock him out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: that doesnt answer my question</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, I believe that voiders need to remain consious to continue being voided out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7f20">CPO: What are Hope's weaknesses?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: despair</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You cast self doubt upon them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Make them lose confidence in their own abilities.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If a hope player thinks he can't do something, Its not going to happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Light's weakness is obvious. bad luck and obfuscation of knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also darkness</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7f20">CPO: So I have to blast through all doubt with sheer mangrit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, I would say the main weakness is situations where luck doesn't matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...eh, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also when you roll high rolls when you need bad rolls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at the same time though, that clusterfuck of bad luck stuff when the HQ was in halloween mode /really/ messed me up :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Messed /you/ up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I rolled all 8s on my 8 Splash Damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it... didn't take off at all.</span><br />
