<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 LOTAL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  uncaptchas her Epee --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#00cece">CURRENT avidCurator [CAC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: but if you stand in my way... i'll be sure to win quickly</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, too bad. I have a bone to pick with you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oooh, don't be so sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings at EQ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals in at a safe distance, watching them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  dodges the attack, and uses the fairly useless part of her epee to attack with: The side of the blade itself. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  is hit, but gets back up quickly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  forget that last part, i didn't know what an epee was --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: A fencing sword?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hmph! My land, my rules. Rule <a href='#18242'>#18242</a>: YOU ARE NOT RUDE, NOR DO YOU ATTACK FELLOW PEOPLE!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings again --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is hit this time, stumbling back a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: O-oh no you don't!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  attacks once again, aiming for the shoulder. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  goes in for another hit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  hits the shoulder, manages to get a swing in before growling in pain --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Grah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  was far too close to dodge, and takes the swing head-on, falling back a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I wonder if you're actually dead right now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: could be, actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Heh, I wish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: meh, i'll asume not since your still talking...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings again --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  quickly dodges, barely scraping by the hit, and aims another attack, this time to the chest. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  is there anything special about the epee that I should know about? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  Not this one, so. Just a metal sword with a very sharp point. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings at the epee --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  was not expecting that bit, and the epee goes flying. Stupid swords are so dang light... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hey!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings again --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: hm, i wonder if CP sees you as dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  dodges, now faster due to lack of weapon. She grabs unto AC's arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  grabs onto other arm with their own --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Doubt it. Now, I really don't want to do this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: what are you going to do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  fakes fear --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  boggles vacantly at what AC said --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But you leave me no choice. Sparking-Hemolia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  what? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral's <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ'S]</span>  general person starts to glow green... and nothing happens. Is the fraymotif not working...? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: oh a fraymotif</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: that could work</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  smiles. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  attempts to lift up and flip EQ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I should use my own fraymotifs more often</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  as soon as AC would try and move any closer as to lift EQ, they would get a sparp electrical pain up their arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  but weren't you holding me --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  *my arm --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  yeah. Electrical pain up the arm  if you moved, basically. Already so close, after all. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  tries to take the pain, I guss --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: *me geuss</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  then is sucsessfully lifted up, despite the electric pain "Oy-?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: OOOW!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeaaah, you get used to that. Not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  slams EQ behind him! Backbreaker! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Now, if you would calm down, this would be a lot easier-</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>   slams with a painful CRACK sound. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  suddenly, jaw changes shape as teeth transform --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNK</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: GRRR...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  struggles to get some sort of footing. Owch... that hurt... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  lets go and takes a step back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not using mental consonance... No, no one deserves that... Just-...? Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  breathing becomes unnatural --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  stumbles, somehow managing to say on her feet. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I'LL. MAKE. SURE. NOT. TO...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: KILL YOU</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: This is not heroic, nor is it just.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: For me, that is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If you continue down this path... well, I'm not sure what to say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gets a bit further away, sensing shit about to escalate --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  glances around the land, and then down at her watch. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  fraymotif: Morthulnome --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Athens will not bother you over this one fight. Just calm down, don't hurt anyone else-</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  //What does it do? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  charges at EQ tentacles beggining to grow slightly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah-..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  hits EQ then goes foward in time and hits him again slightly in the future --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is double combo'd quite easilly. Time powers... gah... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  // also *her --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: ARE YOU READY TO MOVE YET?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  actually just decides to portal off-world entirely, leaving a lakitucam behind for /actually safe/ remote viewing... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  stuggles unto her feet, then uncaptchaing an extra epee of hers. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I don't care anymore, honestly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  smiles, the small fatial tentacles disappear --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: this fight is annoying me</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: if you aren't carefully I might go full on elderitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You are just like the other monsters I fight on a daily basis, now. Nothing more. Worse, in fact. The monsters at least know when to quit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And I don't care.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  takes a deepbreath --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  jaw returns to normal --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If you are going to prove to be a threat, then I will stop at nothing to bring you down to the same level of scum you so clearly belong with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: This is proving to be quite entertaining</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh now? You were saying that this was boring not a minute ago. How funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  uncaptha's a blue potion and downs it, then facing AC. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: You could say i'm caprcious</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fair enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Healed up, Athens and others watching... have at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  bows to AC, and rushes over, this time attacking with the point of the sword. To the neck. No fooling around now. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  seems to be reverting to Nekoloth a bit, seems to be able to keep it in check as it stands --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  doges it with a jump, the attack instead scrapes the side of his shoulder. Its a shallow wound. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: That's going to burn for a few days...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  swings at EQ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No acid on this epee, so don't worry: It won't-</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  shit, keep forgetting its not a real sword... facepalm --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes the hit, knocking her back once again. She almost instantly gets back on her feet to attack, though. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  //oh its a real sword. Just made for stabbing rather than slicing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I wonder how much mangrit you have...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  takes several swings at EQ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is knocked to the ground quite easilly with those attacks. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  attempts to do another backbreaker --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  grabs EQ by legs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: E-Easy really. You just know that you have nothing to loose, besides your life. You got that for free anyways-</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  tries to lift up and flip EQ over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  hisses, stabbing her weapon into AC's arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Let. Go.  Calm. Down. Stop. Being. Horrible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  glances at the blade before roaring and trying hard ot flip EQ oer --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  *trying hard to flip EQ over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  hesitates for a bit... then lets go of the weapon, and tries to slip away from AC. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  loses grip --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#00cece">[CAC]</span>  pulls the epee out of arm --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes a few steps away, and talks into her watch. "Please put athens under lockdown. Athena was right, apparently. Quite right. I'll try and head over shortly..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I'm done with this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... I ask, if you were to leave now... would you still head back to the innocent little party and cause bloodshed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Or are you done?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Especially when a simple hit would have been so much easier</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: and less violent</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I don't care. I'd rather be killed than let others suffer over anothers stupidity. I hate stupidity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 's why I hate this session, really. It's why I hate creatures like you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: what do you think I planned on doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  grins --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: in reality all I would have done was bobbed him upside the head and have been done with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: the only reason i'm fighting with you is because you yourself are being stupid and overreacting</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: It's a nonlethal weapon when I want it to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I can cause as much pain as my hits would allow and it would do nothing more than sting for a bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Up till now i've been using it non-lethaly </span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I somehow doubt that. I simply wouldnt let my friend be hurt, and it lead to this. If I actually let you be lethal out in the world, especially so close to the end... No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: you should stop and let me hit him and be done with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: wouldn't that be simpler?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: a single hit was all i'd do</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Violence solves nothing, in this case. You would still be a monster with such a short fuse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: i'd have no part of wounded or killing another player</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  looks around, seemingly bored --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: this bat is nothing more than a healing shiv as it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could hit him as much as I wanted and it would do nothing more than sting for a second</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You saaaaay so much, and yet here we are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: your reaction is stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You have such a short fuse and have learned nothing. I have at least learned that Athena was right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  smiles, and wardrobifies into her Normal Witch of Mind outfit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Does it honestly matter to you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'd think not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: are you really planning to do this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: are you really planning to kill me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: It was nothing more than a pety grudge and you'd bring it to this</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I have no intentions of killing you. Death is never my goal. I don't need death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I don't need mercy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Please stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: My true intention is this: For you, and all other vile creatures to get off my land. I don't care anymore about what comes next.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: you've already tried my patience long enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: Ironic that you brought me here and now your getting mad at me to leave...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  clances over to the webcams. "I mean you as well." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I'll explain how things could go</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I go back to the party</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh, nonono.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I bop FL on the head</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: it hurts for a moment</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CWS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: i'm done</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: You seem to have made up your mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It's never that simple. I can't trust you. I can't trust most anyone.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: but I have no intention of killing you or fighting back any longer</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: wouldn't it be ironic... if YOU were to cause their destructions</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: if I continue fighting you, there's no telling what will happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#00cece">CAC: I could destroy your land</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Then learn to be calm. Not everything needs a reaction.</span><br />
