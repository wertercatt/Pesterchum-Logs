[04:25:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not much. I think I was actually sleeping for most of it, because I remember the dragon guy... and then woke up in a room here.</span><br />
[04:26:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just spend it making magic items</span><br />
[04:30:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you try not to interact with other people during that time, I think the universe tends to let it happen?</span><br />

[04:44:26] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have no idea. I was only here a few weeks before you, but even all the people I met in the few times I've actually seen people around… no idea where they are.</span><br />

[05:09:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I were to activate it, several smaller metal rods would come out of it.</span><br />
[05:09:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They would each arrange in a different position...</span><br />
[05:09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think there are about... 10?</span><br />
[05:10:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I never really counted... Pretty sure its around 10 though.</span><br />
[05:11:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: some of them go into positions that kinda break my brain...</span><br />
[05:11:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I try not to focus on them.</span><br />
[05:11:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  puts it away. --</span><br />
[05:13:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the book that contained the information about it mentioned something about strings and dimentional membranes?</span><br />
[05:15:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So you've got a device you use?</span><br />
[05:15:26] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's it?</span><br />
[05:15:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, really, thats what helps me focus the spell.</span><br />
[05:16:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And what exactly is this spell?</span><br />
[05:17:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its called "Plane Shift"</span><br />
[05:18:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How does /it/ work exactly? Runes, diagrams, somatic or verbal components… does it have a specific "flow" it taps into?</span><br />
[05:19:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it requires me to focus on the spell alot... moving my hands around and yelling out the name of the spell.</span><br />
[05:20:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the focus I showed you...</span><br />
[05:21:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly all I do is slam the pole into the ground, while focusing and yelling "plane shift"</span><br />
[05:21:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What does it feel like to use it? Would it work for anyone who focussed on those two words?</span><br />
[05:21:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How did you learn it?</span><br />
[05:22:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I read a complex book... I no longer have that book.</span><br />
[05:22:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I don't think so...</span><br />
[05:23:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hm… okay then.</span><br />
[05:24:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if you wanna try and get the lady herself to give you the book... well, I'm not gonna really be able to help you.</span><br />
[05:24:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Which Lady?</span><br />
[05:24:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Lady of Pain.</span><br />
[05:24:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was my second visit.</span><br />
[05:24:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ah. How'd you get it?</span><br />
[05:25:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Picked it off of a dude that was laying in a smoking crater.</span><br />
[05:26:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and who had several rocks sticking through his corpse.</span><br />
[05:26:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Works for me.</span><br />
[05:28:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, the book said that if the focus got destroyed while casting the spell, well, I would be torn apart through multiple dimentions.</span><br />
[05:28:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I didn't see the focus on him.</span><br />
[05:29:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I assume something was attacking him and he tried to escape.</span><br />
[05:29:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you use a different focus for every spell you know?</span><br />
[05:29:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, some spells don't really need a focus... I've been working on transfering all my spells into magical artifacts...</span><br />
[05:30:32] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's your favourite spell? And how have you acquired them all? Are you able to act as a teacher for any?</span><br />
[05:30:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know /every spell/</span><br />
[05:30:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know how you got that idea.</span><br />
[05:31:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I don't have that idea.</span><br />
[05:31:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How have you acquired all of the spells you have acquired?</span><br />
[05:31:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, most of it was either painstaking research, it just "coming to me", or learning it from a book.</span><br />
[05:32:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would have to say that my favorite would have to be Polymorph.</span><br />
[05:32:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stops zoning out --</span><br />
[05:32:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's that one do?</span><br />
[05:32:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you have any of your spellbooks or scrolls with you? And… that sounds like a very interesting spell.</span><br />
[05:32:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Though that version of Explosive Runes which causes the reader to turn to stone is pretty cool too.</span><br />
[05:33:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … you know Explosive Runes?</span><br />
[05:33:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Polymorph allows me to change an object into any other object for a short period of time...</span><br />
[05:33:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, It was one of the first things I learned...</span><br />

[05:34:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's the custom. High five!</span><br />
[05:34:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh.</span><br />
[05:34:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  gives Alanna a high five. --</span><br />
[05:35:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Can you read them to me?</span><br />
[05:35:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I could copy over a few spells, if you wanted.</span><br />
[05:35:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Though I do have a few rules about what spells I share...</span><br />
[05:36:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I will take any I don't already know.</span><br />
[05:36:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's what I do.</span><br />
[05:37:02] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  flips open his book. --</span><br />
[05:37:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'd also be interested in trying to learn some, if I even can...</span><br />
[05:37:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True Strike?</span><br />
[05:37:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's that do?</span><br />
[05:37:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It basically makes shots /impossible/ to miss pretty much.</span><br />
[05:38:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, you still miss 1 time out of 20, but still.</span><br />
[05:38:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh. Huh. What's the mechanics behind it?</span><br />
[05:38:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ?</span><br />
[05:38:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It basically aims at where the target is going to be.</span><br />
[05:39:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ohhh, it's one of those.</span><br />
[05:40:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've got an equivalent.</span><br />
[05:40:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And ocasionally, the shot goes around trees or other stuff in the way.</span><br />
[05:40:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh wow, that sounds useful.</span><br />
[05:41:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm really bad with future sight or predestined strike sort of things.</span><br />

[05:43:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What about summoning creatures?</span><br />
[05:44:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: From a specific talisman?</span><br />
[05:44:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More like, from another universe.</span><br />

[05:44:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: A caller's magic? You can teach me that?</span><br />

[05:48:12] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  the quill finishes, and lays itself down next to the sheet. --</span><br />

[05:48:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is that a spell you can teach?</span><br />
[05:49:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  flips the note book and spell book a few pages. --</span><br />

[08:21:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. seems like Mist Warp, but without needing a mirror at both the start and end points.</span><br />
[08:22:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks, and falls over... oh mother of god /he has a blade of grass sticking out of his leg./ --</span><br />

[08:26:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  and then promptly loses interest in what's happened to him in favour of pulling out a large metal tub from out of nowhere and going to dunk it in the ocean, filling it up, then labouriously dragging it back up out of the water to more of the beach proper.

[08:26:52] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly pulls the incredibly long blade of grass out of his leg. --</span><br />

[08:56:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need to move closer to the water.</span><br />

[09:00:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  puts the amulet around Puppy's neck on "collect" mode, submerging the second portable hole. --</span><br />

[09:39:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I specifically mentioned them.</span><br />

[09:40:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  pulls herself away from him, nearly falling over in the process. "Idiot." And then making her way into her own room and firmly closing the door behind her. --</span><br />

[09:41:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay then.</span><br />
[09:41:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at Kimura, then down the hallway. --</span><br />

[09:41:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I... guess we'll talk later about what you discovered then...</span><br />

[09:42:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, sure. so what is it?</span><br />
[09:43:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, if you are /here/, that may mean that your world is missing a god.</span><br />
[09:43:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On a scale of 1 to 10 on the holy shit quota, this reachs a seven.</span><br />
[09:44:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...huh. I see your point. though to be honest, I didn't even think about that when I met the other wolf...</span><br />
[09:44:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I hope everything's okay at home...</span><br />
[09:44:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: considering a ten is complete destruction of all reality in all of its forms, seven is still quite bad.</span><br />
[09:44:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[09:46:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There /was/ something that managed to make it to a nine... something about a "chaos heart".</span><br />
[09:46:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a what?</span><br />
[09:46:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that was taken care of.</span><br />
[09:46:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh shit, I thought it was a Sonic ref and then I realized Super Paper Mario O_O))</span><br />
[09:47:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...How attached are you to your powers?</span><br />
[09:48:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean, like, can I transfer them to someone?</span><br />
[09:48:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I were to bring Ammy back from the dead, would you be willing to give the powers back?</span><br />
[09:49:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, it would involve using my last wish diamond... but it would be for the greater good.</span><br />
[09:49:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably... she's likely a lot better at it than me anyway.</span><br />
[09:49:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what /is/ a wish diamond, anyway?</span><br />
[09:49:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...A wish diamond is a small diamond with the power to grant one incredibly powerful wish.</span><br />
[09:50:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, bringing someone back from the dead.</span><br />
[09:50:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, /they are incredibly rare/</span><br />
[09:51:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its not like I can constantly make them... I can't even /make/ wish diamonds, I got my three as a boon from a god.</span><br />
[09:51:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, in that case, hold on to it...</span><br />
[09:51:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
[09:51:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there might be another way that doesn't quite THAT much effort.</span><br />
[09:52:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I used my other two on stupid ass stuff, I might as well use the third on something with value.</span><br />
[09:52:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay... if you're sure about that...</span><br />
[09:53:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we will need to make it back to your plane first.</span><br />
[09:53:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that's the other issue...</span><br />
[09:53:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That is why I needed the blood sample, to identify your home plane.</span><br />
[09:53:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[09:53:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: really?</span><br />
[09:54:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
[09:54:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It didn't take much to extract the surface contact of this plane from the sample...</span><br />

[09:57:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It will take a bit to set up the Pole of Plane Shift, as well as getting a way back.</span><br />
