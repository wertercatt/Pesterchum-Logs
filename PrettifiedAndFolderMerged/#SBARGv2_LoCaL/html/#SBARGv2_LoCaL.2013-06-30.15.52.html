<span style="color:#00aa00">CPK: HERO OF THE LAND OF COPPER AND LASERS</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT poeticDeity <span style="color:#000000">[CPD]</span>  creepes out of the dark depths, a huge snakelike body with a masculine human torso. Cloaked in a toga. He gazes down at you. --</span><br />
