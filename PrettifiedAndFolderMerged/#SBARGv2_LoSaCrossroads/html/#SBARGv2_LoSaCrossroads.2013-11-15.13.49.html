<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  weaves between the shots as he closes distance, a few hitting head on.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  one explosive dash toward the next and the shots that almost certainly head for him meet their mark by and large! --</span><br />
