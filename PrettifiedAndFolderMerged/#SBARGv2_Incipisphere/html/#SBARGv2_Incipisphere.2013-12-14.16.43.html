<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its basically Pokemon Box for Ruby and Sapphire... for the new games and an ONLINE CLOUD</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: lets you transfer pokemon from b/w/b2/w2</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: see that explanation requires you to know what pokemon box r/s was</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wonder if I can use it in combination with the Pal Park...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so basically it's X/Y's "trade from earlier gens" thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If so, I'm going to be getting a Jirachi.</span><br />
