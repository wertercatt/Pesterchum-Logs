<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: Not true in the slightest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: From a standard viewpoint do you seriously think everyone would be trying to hard to get you to stick around if that were the case?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: to tell the truth, it's actually sorta comforting when your handle is idling in a memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: And from a concrete viewpoint you're a puzzle-solving /fiend/ and like MA said we wouldn't have gotten even close to this far if not for you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: nvm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: dude, a /lot/ of things i've had planned didn't work out, it happens all the time, even if it was something i'd planned for a while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: the best thing you can do is try to move forward and maybe try again another time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. plans will always get messed up in SOME way, and you just have to keep moving forward despite that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Well it can't happen anymore, what I meant by that is that it was stupid for me to have lurked in any other memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: Not really.</span><br />
