[10:57:05] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I am way too tired for much, at the moment.</span><br />
[10:59:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Athena, do you know Dionysus? I heard he was awesome at parties.</span><br />
[10:59:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: would this rumor be true?</span><br />
[11:00:35] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hehehe Yeah, He's such aa jerk most of the time, but MAN does he host great parties.</span><br />
[11:01:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ceca54">CURRENT fortuitousSleuth [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[11:01:17] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  also to be quite feared if the<span style="color:#730e8f"> Bacchae is anything to go by</span></span><br />
[11:01:23] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  fun<span style="color:#730e8f"> fact</span></span><br />
[11:02:42] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Well, that goes for almost any sort of deitie, yeah.</span><br />
[11:04:14] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  well yes, but Dionysus in<span style="color:#730e8f"> particular has a sort of special case</span></span><br />
[11:05:59] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  you recall his o<span style="color:#730e8f">rigin do you not?</span></span><br />
[11:07:20] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  according to myth Dionysus was bor<span style="color:#730e8f">n by Zeus and a mortal woman</span></span><br />
[11:08:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I heard Hestia and Dionysus have this huge ass rivalry</span><br />
[11:08:51] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Typical greek myth:starting with Zeus and... yeah... anyeays, Yeah I remember the myth.</span><br />
[11:09:27] <span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  then you also recall what becam<span style="color:#730e8f">e of the rest of his mortal relatives?</span></span><br />
[11:09:29] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yep. In the myth,  Hestia ended up having to give up her spot as a major goddess for the guy.</span><br />
[11:09:43] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ah... yes...</span><br />
[11:10:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly, we must treat these myths the same way as the Glitch FAQ</span><br />
[11:10:37] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Indeed</span><br />
[11:10:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alot of it is true, but at the same time, there is quite a bit that is overstated.</span><br />
[11:11:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or forgotten</span><br />
[11:11:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or just made up to fill in the blanks</span><br />
[11:11:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like the tale Noah's Ark</span><br />
[11:11:38] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Yep. I mean, myself for example: I know I'm big headed, but I wouldnt turn someone into a spider because of their art.</span><br />
[11:11:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tale of*</span><br />
[11:11:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[11:12:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no comment</span><br />
[11:12:36] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, shut up.</span><br />
[11:13:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: anyway, there is no possible way that Noah's Ark could have held all of those animals... but it could have been a spaceship... with /cloning/</span><br />
[11:13:32] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: pfft</span><br />
[11:13:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think you would turn someone into a spider /permanently/</span><br />
[11:13:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe for a couple days.</span><br />
[11:14:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (that could be me projecting though, as I did /try/ to put PO's soul in a jar for a period of time, but he had hair clones)</span><br />
[11:15:17] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Arachne was generally known as the mother of all spiders, in the myth. -And there is no mention of her turning back in the myth, so. In real life, then your statement is correct.</span><br />
[11:15:56] <span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Noone could survive that huge a change that suddenly for very long.</span><br />
[11:23:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: true</span><br />
[11:26:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, the standard instincts would be missing... it depends more on the way the transformation was done</span><br />
[11:27:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, was it changing the DNA itself, or just using magic to assume a transformed form?</span><br />
[11:28:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, the neurology would be something to think about as well...</span><br />
[11:28:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not concerned about the transformation itself, I know that magic can do that... I'm just thinking about the aftereffects</span><br />
