<p class="p9"><span class="s2">CNK: :o</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: I tend to try and limit my tabs, more option to dig through history or take convoluted link paths to refind things. </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: *what is grammar </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: *opting </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CCP: the main reason I leave shit open rather than bookmark is because it preserves per-tab history, so I theoretically have a chance of remembering why the fuck the thing was open to begin with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: shrug </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">CNK: :O</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: oh yeah, CS, did you remember to mention in the credits page that I answered a fair handful of the asks? </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CCP: but yeah, every few months I have to go through each tab, see what was happening in there. nothing interesting, just close it. might want to read later, shove it into a bookmarks folder aptly named "Read-Later Captchalogues" then close it. or if it's a YT video, shove into the watch-later playlist.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CCP: and clearly I'm overdue to do that</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: I still wonder if anyone managed to figure out the sequence of hypothetical events behind the turning point post. </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">CNK: :O</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CCP: &gt;:?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: pretty much, Seth originally posted the panel link on the chumplist, and then Ornis reblogged it before Chronos could delete the post. </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CCP: oh, that</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s2">CEQ: Oh yeaaah!</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s2">CEQ: That explains why it was reblogged, but not on the original blog okay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">CNK: well im out</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">CNK: bye</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: seeya Nak! </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s9">CNK</span><span class="s2"> ceased responding to memo.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: and btw, there aren't really 80 tracks in volume 2. there's probably more around 20 or less or something. </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CCP: and on that /really awkward/ bombshell in the IC memo, gnight everybody and I'm glad that v2 ended on a positive note</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">CSJ: goodnight CP! </span><span class="s4">➜</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">CCS: ...I was idle for a bit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">CCS: Goodnight CP!</span></p>
