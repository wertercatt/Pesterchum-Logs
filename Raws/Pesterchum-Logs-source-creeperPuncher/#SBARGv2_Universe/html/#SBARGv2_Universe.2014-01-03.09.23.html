<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just had a horrible thought. If we can't go back, and we just lost use of alchemy, the next step for paradox space to try to kill us off would be to delete objects created by alchemy, and if it decided to /really/ decide to be a dick... remove aspect powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This isn't a reward, its a death trap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: good for you. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is it just me? Am I overly paranoid?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL. I think you are being a liiiiiiiittle too paranoid. Or need some sleep. Either or.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, why do you only focus on the negative?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its quite simple.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EQ, "and" fits better here actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Without alchemy, we will be unable to power DS's ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Fair point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -well, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And a large amount of other methods of travel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Replicators still work, right? The hard-coded stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Replicators do work, but you need original materal and they require a power source.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: replicators were alchemized, but are not Sburb Tech themselves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and yeah, the raw-material thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What about the Golden Node?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does that still work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, I... think so? I don't have anything to test it with right now though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: golden what? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if it stops working, we should find out as soon as the internet drops out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Golden SkaiaNet Hub</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically a battery that never runs out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: something that Crux and I alchemized during an alchemy mini-binge on Prospit</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, that thing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, I need you to promise me this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If the powernodes cut out, I need you to go back and stop us from entering the new universe, through any means necessary.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Such as pestering yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I don't think that's a very good solution., ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL, that is a stupid idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, its better than me ripping off your leg.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If everything goes to shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, what are you doing to my prostheticleg? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We can deal with no alchemy, but if we lose power, we are boned.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's ways to generate power legit, have you forgotten 6th grade science class? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...might be a tad bit over reacting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: "might"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well yeah, we could rebuild the infirstructure back on earth, but without the golden power node, we won't have access to Beta Earth internet for assistance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, a secondary option would be to use my godtier revivals as a battery...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but that could cut out as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, seriously?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A large amount of energy is released as heat and light when a god tier revives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL. As stated before, there are easy ways to generate power. Just calm down, and stop going over-the-top with paranoia.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait shit that could be considered heroic</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EQ, there are easy ways to get power, but none on the level for space travel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you plan on building a space ship that uses coal to travel faster than light.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (starbound is /stupid/)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you just FA wing there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah, but its not like any of us are on a strict schedule. We have a ton of time. Besides, we would only really need enough power to send people safely through the transportalizers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Did I?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I think that was unintentional, like :O in parens with no space becomes <span style="color:#2b0057">:O)</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hannah, /we/ might not have a time limit, but the consorts and Rob have limited life spans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you want to freeze them solid or upload them to computers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EQ, I thought transportalizers were self-powered through shenanigans or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: CP, i dont know. Maybe? If thats the case, then my point still stands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You do not need to be so paranoid FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how was that last bit paranoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You can just send people through those to safety.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -I'm saying as a general, you are acting kinda paranoid. :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Without FTL, it would take... what is the fastest Project Orion could launch spaceships at?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Note that Project Orion was basically propelling spaceships with nukes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And is the fastest method other than warp drive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean we could obviously use space and time players to combine time dialation (at incredibly high speeds) with time travel to get places before we even left, sooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, that sounds like a cool idea ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But with the slim case that aspect powers might fade as well makes that... terrifying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't wanna be stuck 50 million lightyears away from home with /sublight/ engines, thank you very much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like Condy after the Vast Glub?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm pretty sure that aspect powers just nee a recharge after extended use. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *need ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also shit, what happens if the game makes not only aspect powers fade, but /prototyping/ powers as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (dammit FL now you got ME being paranoid too!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, but I'm saying on the slight chance we lose our aspect powers like what Chronos was worried about so much which caused the issue in /his/ session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh my god I'm chronostier paranoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...either that or he was right, but that makes me sound even more paranoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: brb, facepalming ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: sigh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, if this all comes to pass and I lose /both/ my power sets, I'm blaming you... assuming I can even still speak then, if it happened while I was in wolf form.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If that comes to pass I want you to kill me since there is no possible way I'm going to stand being on this planet with the reward stripped.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless it forces us to keep immortality after we lose our powers in that case I'm likely going to snap and start stabbing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Gambit Tier with the stabbing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually, DS' consorts would have to translate for me if that happened...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I don't think Paradox Space would go /that/ far to punish us, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it may be a dick sometimes, but it's not flat-out malevolent. if it was, it would've sent LE into our session before Chronos had even shown up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it tried but LE killed Chronos's frog. At least thats what Brown had said in his.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He could have been lying though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I heard it was a dude dressed up as lord english, but that's probably just me. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So a Cosplayer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I dunno, maybe? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suppose its the most simple explanation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, I'd like to see /you/ power a spaceship with coal.</span><br />

<span style="color:#860000">CNK: nk</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: other than me being a total Lv0 noob at starbound, nothing much</span><br />
<span style="color:#860000">CNK: time nakvel</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: So BORED</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, you can only play yahtzee with eight sided dice for so long before getting tired of the novelty. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( also drama ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((is anyone else still on it?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok, server down... but is anyone wanting to minecraft?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I'm down for it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok, and Ash said in skype that she wants to... three players is the minimum to be feasible, so server going up momentarily then))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((might take me a moment due towikieditingandtalking to EP, but I will get on the server.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((mmk))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((server up when anyone's ready so...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ((Wish I had money for it.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...I just really hope that starbound had gone over better, as everyone was freaking out. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((they're trying to sort it out in the skype chat))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( sounded like the argument started over a space dick. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it technically did))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah......))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...worst reason to start an argument ever. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( seriously it should of been up to kimura ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( but then someone would have hacked in a dick ship... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( seriously, that was a dickish argument. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Pun completely intended. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I don't know anymore... the only reason I'm even a server host is because I'm the only player left with both suitable bandwidth AND a strong enough computer. I have no idea how to moderate things, arguments or otherwise.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well I /kinda/ could host a server, but I would need to find the right game. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Needs to be able to be hosted on Linux. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...oh, you're a linux user FL? didn't know that, huh.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay, got those things out of the way))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( No, but the server I would use is. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...gotcha.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Minecraft with mods would be good, but I would need to figure out how to ensure the modpack is easy to get. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I still feel bad for letting it go as long as it did, even if my starbound-noobiness wasn't a factor))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so... <span style="color:#008080">WH4T NOW?</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, there's always minecraft. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh boy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (tbh I'm kinda getting sick of minecraft)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it helps if you have a project. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, what would I reasonably make? Lacus City?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Astrum Republic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wherewhat? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well FL, as soon as I finish this thing and build a path between the two netherportals, you'll have ocean access...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kinda doubt I would be able to build the Astrum Republic without creative mode u_u</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it would be a flying city /in the end/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I meant for that underwater thing you wanted to do, but good point I guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats also gonna be hard...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /even in creative/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if only sponges worked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (cough)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, those things from classic creative. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, apparently MCP's finally finished parsing 1.7.2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, according to the optifine thread, MCP finished doing their thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which means both optifine /and/ spigot should hopefully be updating soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and as soon as they do, I can update the server and make a new /creative mode/ map :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and then I can resume being able to see the sun again! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait where do you build SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I mean, considering the draw distance stuff ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, in this version, I have it on short, but in the latest version, I can set it to enough chunks so I can see the cool stuff in the sky. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which will get /even cooler/ when you can combine it with Optifine</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah SJ, doesn't OF solve your problem in the current version?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't use optifine. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yes, I know, I'm a horrible noob who should burn in the nether for not using it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to figure out what mods I should use if I host a server...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know I'll use Thaumcraft 4 and Ars Magica 2 for the magic side of things...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...dammit, a major mod is kinda in an experimental state.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, I don't need it /that much/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plenty of other mods to use instead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (ref for self: portal B coords = -53, 41, 170; portal A coords = 2, 46, 3)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so southwest then, nether-ways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why do baby zombies CAUSE PAIN THROUGH DOORS?! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: idek</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tell me if I should adjust this</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I would be fine with getting rid of all the Open Mods.</span><br />
