<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 OOCPLANNING.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT fLmun [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey guys, glad you could make it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heya.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  *crickets* --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, something about the pit of 100 trials and most of the LoSaC's</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sorry, my boss had to pester me about something. namely, we're releasing in five days and Pwootage still hasn't fixed the save format.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I figure we could do a glitch that causes-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry, I'm confused.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: latura stuff probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, it could maybe work, but the question is, would CA's and CS' LOSACs also have Pits of 100 Trials?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, latura stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Latura? Hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, Cube2/Minecraft?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um... kind of. it's the same genre as minecraft (voxel-based sandbox game), but we're basically trying to do it "right", with more cool stuff and being modding-friendly from the beginning</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: our main selling point is "space". the game has finite worlds on different planets, and you'll be able to travel between them (kind of Spore-ish)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What programming language is it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: java</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Brai- oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do they wrap around or end abruptly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wraparound</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YES.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So uh... how deep does the stuff go?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: 64 blocks to bedrock then a legendary infinite void (which actually warps you back topside in this build)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured if you could go to space there might be some sort of liquid core.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right now, the game is basically where Minecraft Classic was, a creative mode with a few wandering entities and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least it isn't programmed in brainfuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats an actual language.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we went with java because it's the one language we're all familiar with (started out as a minecraft modding team), and it's the easiest to cross-platform because of good old Write Once Run Anywhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But anyway, back to Pit of 100 trials.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think planning-ways, it'd be easier if only our two LOSACs had Pits, because then we could go down through one and then abscond out the other. if there's four, then that's four ways the party has to split for the absconding sequence, which is kind of hard to write for</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that seems to make sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suppose the exit times could be close enough that it would exit to the same location.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if people abscond...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (hahahaha best typo ever and it still accepted it <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/wanikani_pitch_blapck.png'>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/wanikani_pitch_blapck.png</a> )</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ... so, fmn on pesterchum.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean espernet</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oops</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (well, invite-only channel)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  facepalms so hard --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: btw, technically that was my presentself in the past IC</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, Future Me should be more careful about multiscreen printscreening :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm guessing the planning stuff here is planned now</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah basically. we were mostly done with the convo in incipi anyway when you made this separate memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright then.</span><br />
