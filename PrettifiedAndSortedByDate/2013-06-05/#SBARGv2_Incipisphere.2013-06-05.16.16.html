<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I found something cool... Its invisible paint...</span><br />

inquiry: invisible paint?<br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#969619">CURRENT elaborateUtopianist [CEU]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1224 Mercury Grist, 1662 Quartz Grist, makes a single spray can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Odd Ammounts, but its interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: amounts*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess its magic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, it causes light to bend around an object...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Unlikely to be magic I believe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Resulting in near invisibility... My googles of true seeing can still see right through it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Not powered by various byproducts of another power such as the Horrorterrors after all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Sorry, QUANTUM FIELD MANIPULATION.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...are we done with the technical aspects of this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Though frankly, this game is so far removed from the fields of any conventional sciences that everything falls under pseudobullshit</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#6507ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: magic</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Indeed, everything might as well be magic</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: It's Magic, I don't have to explain tits.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."</span><br />
statement: "magic" is not a suitable explanation<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Clarke's third law.</span><br />
acknowledgement: the stupid one is right for once.<br />
even though he is only quoting a much smarter man.<br />
or perhaps only because of that.<br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...I like you Kami.</span><br />
bashful response: oh shucks<br />
you are going to make me blush~<br />
were i capable of blushing, at least.<br />
...<br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...wut.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pff, you only like him because he is an Arti- a Genesic Intelegence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...?</span><br />
mental note: request progenitor grant me "blushing" function to properly convey bashfulness.<br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: can you explain my magic τhen? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: We are currently playing a game that is considered one the glitchiest, buggiest pieces of crap on the metareality overlay genre market</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Since it is also the ONLY metareality overlay game on the market</span><br />
challenge issue: acknowledge<br />
promptly accepted<br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and also the market is gone now</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I think magic can be explained as a thing that exists for some reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Especially considering there seems to be no universally accepted answer of what it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Magic A is Magic B, something along those lines</span><br />
presumably<br />
magic is actually the channeling of forces beyond typical understanding towards seemingly impossible goals.<br />
paradox space is engineered such that time travel within its boundaries is not only typical but encouraged, for one example.<br />
one might look on time travel as magic. when really it is a much simpler displacement in temporal forces.<br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Magic is basically what is impossible, according to the world we know.</span><br />
exactly.<br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And the world we know is a burning pile of rubble now, presumably</span><br />
similarly exact.<br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I guess world we knew?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Speaking of which, anyone begin figuring out how to do...uh...anything with their aspect yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Useful?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I thought Psycho Burgundy was my board's effect... but I'm starting to think its my own, funnily enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aside from that, if I focus really hard... I can tap into a weird kind of omni-awareness, or at least one exclusive to myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The stuff I've gotten up to in alternate timelines... the stuff in the past that got erased in the scratch... stuff like that, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sifting through it's a bitch though, and its kinda taxing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ah...Time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Heart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oohoo</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, RS is a heart hero, and thus his powers tend to deal with the soul, or ones inner essence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I can't see the future, only stuff that's already happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Heart bros?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Mm...no, stupid name</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Even though its technically not happened anymore or it happened in alternate timelines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it tends to oppose mind... which might be why I BREAK EVERYTHING I TOUCH.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Anyways, as a fellow hero of Heart glad to make your aquaintance</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Likewise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What's your name, by the by? I'm Robert.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Rob for short, or Raz if you wanna stoke my ego.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Mike/Michael</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My land? Well, its pretty fucked up now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I figure I would be breaking it further if I started investing... not really "investing", but beginning to buy grists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And do none of the selling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As among the stuff that is broken around me, my Boondollars seems to be one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, I have PIx10 Boonbanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Forever.</span><br />
...<br />
wait, i'm sorry.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just seems to be broken in a fixed value.</span><br />
pregnant silence: ...<br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT flightlessIcarus [CFI]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: hello sj</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I've found that the Byzantium Halo's pretty good for improving my own...trustworthiness I guess? in the eyes of the local consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: kihihihi</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey Chicarus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hi SJ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi TT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: finαlly someone i cαn stαnd comes online</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Greetings both</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sorry, FI's too close to Fi, so I gotta come up with something for you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, you don't get along with Kami?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Chicarus is cool right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: you can'τ sτand me? :C meanie.</span><br />
inquiry: who is this "flightlessIcarus" person<br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: my nαme is seth</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Holy shit bro I don't think I knew that until just this second, never heard it used.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Alright Seth, afternoon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: you're cool too tt</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And y'know that hurts man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seth beat me in battle once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You can't stand me? That hurt's big time</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: yay C:&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ;~;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, more that I conceded it to him, but thats not the point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: you αre αll αssholes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sure we'll be all chummy with eachother in the end.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...or maybe not</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Or we'll kill each other</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ouch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Hasn't happened yet, but who knows?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well screw you too man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: please don'τ kill eachoτher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or we will force eachother to play sonic 06... which might be just as bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: they αren't worth the time it would tαke to kill them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, not just beat sonic 06...</span><br />
observation: there seems to be a lot of bad blood between a paticular subset of your ranks<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Complete it 100%/</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Well it's rather inconvinient and also rather playing into the hands of Mr. Chronos</span><br />
observation 2: it would be a shame if you killed one another over petty arguements<br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: why did you have τo say iτ's name.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: thαt guy is the biggest αsshole</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets just not talk about him infront of TT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that, I can agree with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Agreed</span><br />
proposal: to hash out your problems without any risk of bodily harm, disputes and bad blood should be settled with fist fights<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It brings up bad memories for everyone... and I think it might be worse for her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, arm wrestling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, gog dammit, I can't pick a non violent alternative.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: How about video game making, rather?</span><br />
counter proposal: acknowledged. promptly shelved for silliness.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Wait, how about... CHECKERS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: play smash bros</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The one who manages to alchemize the crappiest video game wins</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, Sonic 06 &amp;&amp; ET.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I've already alchemized Sonic 06 and SBaHJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There is</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nothing that gets worse then that</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: PL▲Y M▲RIΘ P▲-waiτ no τhaτ would make τhings WΘRSE</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: HAHAHAHAHAHA!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: NONO I like this idea!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's hash out our issues over Mario Party!</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: oh god whaτ have I done</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kaizo Sonic 06 the Extraterrestrial on drugs??</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not mario party.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hahahahahaha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Why the hell not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: You never know, maybe the horribleness would wrap around and transition into the best game ever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That destroys friendships.</span><br />
pregnant silence: ...<br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: So you're saying...</span><br />
perhaps i should not have suggested anything<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is your silence going to have a baby</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Mario Party &amp;&amp; Monopoly instead</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: PFT SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fist fights it is.</span><br />
my silence is pregnant with awkwardness, not human children.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except then we can't resolve issues with KAMI!</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Hah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: hα</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to have the chalenge in some sort of format that GI's can interface with.</span><br />
solution: you will never need to solve issues with me, for they will be nonexistant<br />
i am just cool like that<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Kami is a Sarcastic GI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But GIs solve all their problems with punching and/or shooting</span><br />
obviously.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GI means Genesic Intelegence, since his maker had a bit of a power trip apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why couldn't he just called him an AI like everyone else?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Exactly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh wait because that would be /boring/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we can't have /that/, now can we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Avoid unlikely confusion between your artificial intelligences and your general infantry</span><br />
statement: perhaps there is hope for you yet FL<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</span><br />
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br />
see i can do that thing too<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wonder if I c</span>an break my text!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  </span> OH LOOK I HAVE NO LIFE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: ...And that's Mirror 1 of 8 completed</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...whaτ is even going on</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mirror?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Only seven more to go now, I really must thank FS for his cayenne pepper code</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Yes, I'm taking the time to work on my Quests</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What's the deal with these mirrors?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Have to Rebuild the Eight Mirrors of the Great Central Watchtower</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Which will shine the light to guide me to the various underground books and ritual sites needed to Raise the Dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, any codes for items you can't draw?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That you would like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and that in turn opens up the next part of the Quest, which is to remake the Grand Expeditionary Army of LOGAM and conquer the entire planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That you know combonations using them as ingredients?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Hmm...would you happen to have a welding torch with you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, I think I can draw that-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DAMMIT CROWBAR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Or quite possibly a history book on the French Revolution?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry, I'll try to get this... hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: There's two possible spears I'm looking at, but they both require ingredients I utterly fail to have on hand</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Two spears huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What is this, Rebuild 3.0?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I really, really want to get myself a Blood-ier of Tyrants. I've got the blood, the spear, and the Globin, Gold, and Brass grist...I just need something suitably french and history related</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Blood-ier...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: of Tyrants?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Well, it could be the Communist revolution, or the American revolution, or the French one. Some revolution, at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...You lost me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a picture of napoleon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ooh, that will do nicely</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I got it when trying to draw Kirk...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me just dig through my modus...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Stupid file system modus... why don't you have a search function...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh, and sorry. The Blood-ier of Tyrants. Polearm, really, more than a spear. Serrated edge, gilded metal, probably bleeds targets out</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and it looks really, really cool...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ooh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah that sounds wickec.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I didn't trudge around a desert full of blood oasises for weeks in full armour not to treat myself to something nice every once in a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Thanks for doing this, FL...Do you need any codes yourself? Maybe some explosives? I've got one for a Gunpepper powder, works quite well for heat related tasks</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Here, "8ADf8HK5"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not supposed to touch explosives anymore. Its an unspoken rule.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
