<div class=memolog>
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 FORESTLAKE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#722881">CURRENT awesomeSwordfish [CAS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  swooshes in, having stopped her ridiculous lauging at this  poitn and sets down --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues following them at a distance --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  was dragged to this spot. Okay. Wha. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  blinks a bit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  sets her down --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  points to the lake --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  has ceased being dragged. Thank gosh. She looks at the lake. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  finds spot to sit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also stares lake-ward... is it the one FL has a hideout under, or a different lake? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  the same one FL had a hideout under --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... sure, by the lake is fine. There's a nice spot to relax in the actual lake itself, buuuuut that requires swimming in cold water.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Oh right, paper and pens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  rummages about her invintory a bit, before handing AS a simple whiteboard and respective marker. That'll be easier than erasing stuff. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So, talk. What do you want?</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  looks a bit shy/sad --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Look, if you think this is mental, then yeah I can help. Buut... well, you can indeed talk or write to people about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm far from the only solution with mental-thingys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues staying hidden, letting them talk --</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: 'but to do that, i would need to know why'</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: 'which i don't'</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: bleh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, that is true... but letting someone poke around your mind is not fun. Talk to other people about how you feel and what they think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ' so tell other people i have no idea why i'm silent...'</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'Basically, yeah. It can't hurt, and more people will be willing to offer help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It's better than pretending that you do know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: '..i don't like the idea of going around and saying 'hi, i'm mute and don't know why' either'</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Like I said: people will have more options and suggestions. Honestly letting someone mess with the very way you think should be a last-case situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Just... talk to people about it. We are still dealing with the concequences of not offering proper help to a problem sooner in the form of Kat, who can't even really talk right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  sighs and nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: 'as for that thing...it's going to sound odd i suppose</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: '</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'Suppose so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Buuuuuut honestly its the best choice. Besides, people have been touchy about mind-manipluation at the best of times, previously agreed or not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: 'i um...created 'mind beings' personalities in the form of fictional characters who exist to help me with emotional issues. that's the strange thing i was talking  about</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: '</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  looks embarrassed --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... that's odd, yeah... but then again: people tend to take on at least some traits of their favorite characters?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Some take an ideal... some end up looking like them... </span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: 'some just make their own characters that aren't based on anything else to help them because they were in serious need of not going out into full rage quits'</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Everyone has a different mind, what can I say? 'Cant judge too much for something harmless like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: (dude..break a twig r something XD))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  on cue steps on a twig --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  looks about. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues hiding --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Someone there? May as well speak up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  suddenly pulls out her sword but does do anything except tilts it a bit, getting reflections --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Say your opinion on the situation and what-not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher's <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP'S]</span>  tail is slightly visible behind a tree --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  puts the sword away and tosses a small stone so it hits the tree next to him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  realizes hiding's not gonna work anymore, and comes out from behind it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...hi guys...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  pouts then sighs and waves him over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  walks over and sits down --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Heya. So. What do you think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: about her unexplained muteness, or about things in general?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Either or. It's calm here. Preferably muteness, but eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Say what you want to say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... that part earlier, about taking on the traits of one's favorite characters, or even looking like them...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: were you specifically referring to me when you said that last bit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  tries and fails to hide her smile/amusement --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... No, but now that I think about it: You are a good example for that, huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I guess I am the spitting image of Ammy, huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  listens more readily, tilting her head --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, I have no clue about Mindy stuff... even so, there's probably some way to solve the muteness thing without brain invading...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Probably. 's what I'm suggesting... maybe other people in the memo have clues?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: can't hurt to ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Or people who are currently asleep? Maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AD and SJ are still awake... so's Kat technically, but she's still trying to re-learn to english.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  pulls out a phone looking device and starts texting --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah... Kat is an entirely different situation...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  smiles faintly as she talks to and about kat and fl --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  just sighs... which eventually turns into a yawn. It's that late already...? Gah... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  looks up at EQ and unintentionally yawns too --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks at them and makes it a yawn x3 combo --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well... I'm going to be off for a bit. Contact me when everything has been decided and talked about, I guess. 'Ni- pfffft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: did you know that of all the animals that yawn, the only species that exhibit /contagious/ yawning are humans... and dogs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Heh... but yeah, night.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  shakes head --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  and pats eq's head waving a bit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is patted. She then gets up from her seat and waves, heading off into the forest. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  watches her for a bit before looking at kimura --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  //and there goes the wild EQ, back to its natural habitat. See how it is barly awake and is most likely thinking about food or something. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  XDDD --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //pff --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  tugs on kimura's sleeve and starts floating back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT awesomeSwordfish <span style="color:#722881">[CAS]</span>  and yawns --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  oh right, following --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CEQ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
