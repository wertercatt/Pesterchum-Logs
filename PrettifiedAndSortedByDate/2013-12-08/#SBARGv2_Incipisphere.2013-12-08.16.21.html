[04:21:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[04:21:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ding.</span><br />
[04:21:30] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: yes</span><br />
[04:21:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Thank you.</span><br />
[04:22:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[04:22:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So uh... now that we have a "few" people...</span><br />
[04:22:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Now, foremost, this has been a developing situation for a month now, if not longer. As such, plans in place have been worked out for the course of said month. </span><br />
[04:23:22] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: And no one bothered to tell me about this?</span><br />
[04:23:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: With you now insistently throwing yourself into it all you have placed us in a position of uncertainty and unease.</span><br />
[04:23:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TV, I asked for a moment to explain. I hoped that it was implied that it would go uninterrupted.</span><br />
[04:24:16] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: yes, sorry</span><br />
[04:24:36] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Well no one bothered to tell me that the blue holes gone how did that happen?</span><br />
[04:24:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll just... post the link to the memo so I can prepare. <a href='#SBARGv2_Hotel'>#SBARGv2_Hotel</a></span><br />
[04:25:17] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: wait its a hotel thing?</span><br />
[04:25:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no</span><br />
[04:25:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this is different</span><br />
[04:25:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, lets let SE continue here</span><br />
[04:25:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Because the nature of dealing with EQ and their respective denizen was to remain subtle and not to draw to much outsider attention, it remained unspoken and kept amongst trusted individuals who were either involved or needed to aid.</span><br />
[04:26:05] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: I still dont understand</span><br />
[04:26:18] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: that's stupid</span><br />
[04:26:25] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: assume some random shit happend that involved this</span><br />
[04:26:32] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and you couldn't explain the situation</span><br />
[04:26:38] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: we'd be completely defenseless </span><br />
[04:26:42] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: You have now been involved, I understand what with the supposed mindfukin'. But despite this you have insistently shoved yourself into the fray with no concern as to how others may be preparing to deal with it.</span><br />
[04:27:14] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Well i'm not going to quit until i'm in the circle</span><br />
[04:27:27] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: i'm involved and unless you tell me whats going on, i'm going to prepare my own way</span><br />
[04:27:31] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Because of such, you have identified yourself as both volatile and unstable. Tell me, TV. Why would we include you when you have shown only to cause upset and turmoil?</span><br />
[04:28:18] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: the upset and turmoil wouldn't have occured if you assholes weren't keeping secrets</span><br />
[04:28:25] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: either i'm involved or i'm continuing</span><br />
[04:28:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: You've shown to us your emotional and incapable of handling trauma in this sense. It is necessary that those involved can maintain both emotional stability and the ability to reason.</span><br />
[04:28:31] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: no way i'm going to sit idly</span><br />
[04:28:43] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm not asking you to sit idly.</span><br />
[04:28:48] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: clearly you just did that</span><br />
[04:30:05] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm ordering you to pull you self-righteous head out of your ass and get a MOTHERFUKIN' GRIP ON YOUR JIVE ASS SELF. You wanna keep running down this bullshit guns totting path of yours? Sure. It'll probably just end up with your Blood splattered on the floor and more of a MOTHERFUCKIGN MESS FOR US ALL.</span><br />
[04:30:06] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So sit the /fuck/ down and think about how to proceed.</span><br />
[04:30:14] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Not run blindly into the fire.</span><br />
[04:30:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Motherfukin' think.</span><br />
[04:30:30] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: THEN FUCKING TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.</span><br />
[04:30:44] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Fucking.</span><br />
[04:30:46] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Think.</span><br />
[04:32:17] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I am</span><br />
[04:32:17] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and I THINK I want to know what's going on...</span><br />
[04:32:17] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: No. You wanna know the quickest route to running off and exacting your revenge.</span><br />
[04:32:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we told you what was going on, you would likely charge into the fray, then Athena would forcefully extract the information from your brain before killing you easily, which is what /would/ happen.</span><br />
[04:32:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And when you inevitably do, and fail to return, what then? We've got a mess to clean up that's bigger than the last.</span><br />
[04:33:16] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Then monitor me and see what I intend to do...</span><br />
[04:33:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[04:33:39] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: what the hell is going on?!</span><br />
[04:33:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we should just lock you in a padded cell.</span><br />
[04:33:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where the blue hole used to be.</span><br />
[04:33:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: FL. Lock it down.</span><br />
[04:34:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That way, if he timewarps, he will be going face first into the blue hole.</span><br />
[04:34:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Lock. It. Down.</span><br />
[04:34:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right.</span><br />
[04:35:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: TV. We both know that monitoring you is both impractical and a sorry option.</span><br />
[04:35:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: What I need to see out of you to prove that you have any hope of actually getting what you want, is to see you let go.</span><br />
[04:36:03] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: All that gory revenge you want?</span><br />
[04:36:19] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: All that bloody glory in self-reighteous victory?</span><br />
[04:36:22] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Let.</span><br />
[04:36:22] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It.</span><br />
[04:36:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Go.</span><br />
[04:36:37] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: that's not what I want though</span><br />
[04:36:45] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: If I </span><br />
[04:36:45] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Let.</span><br />
[04:36:46] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: It.</span><br />
[04:36:47] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Go.</span><br />
[04:37:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I just realized a better spot.</span><br />
[04:37:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Cut the chatter, FL.</span><br />
[04:37:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
[04:37:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll just assume the answer to making it there is a "yes"</span><br />
[04:37:47] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: What I want, is to keep EQ from getting my ass killed or doing that shit to me again</span><br />
[04:37:51] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: by any means I have to</span><br />
[04:38:07] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: because quite frankly</span><br />
[04:38:13] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: mindfucking isn't something I enjoy</span><br />
[04:38:21] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: If it means fixing EQ</span><br />
[04:38:29] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I want to know</span><br />
[04:39:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And you'll never get it if you can't learn to leave some things behind.</span><br />
[04:39:48] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I'm not leaving it behind</span><br />
[04:39:55] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: as i've said</span><br />
[04:40:00] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I can't leave it behind</span><br />
[04:40:04] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Then you'll never truly get it.</span><br />
[04:41:23] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: then i'll never truly get it</span><br />
[04:41:27] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: the point is</span><br />
[04:41:39] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: It's too late for you to get me to just leave</span><br />
[04:45:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm not trying to get you to leave.</span><br />
[04:45:35] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: YOU JUST SAID THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO DO</span><br />
[04:46:01] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm tying to make you realize that this is too close to you. And if you have you can't distance yourself from them, emotionally or rationally, then you can't be of use to them.</span><br />
[04:46:45] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: ...</span><br />
[04:46:56] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: you better tell me what's up if I promise to do this</span><br />
[04:47:08] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I'll destroy the whole fleet</span><br />
[04:47:15] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Prove to me you can do it in the first place.</span><br />
[04:48:03] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I'll complete retire every ship</span><br />
[04:48:09] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: destroy the ADD</span><br />
[04:48:13] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and the frayamp</span><br />
[04:48:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Who are you trying to threaten? Me? Or the people who care about those things.</span><br />
[04:49:04] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Hm?</span><br />
[04:49:47] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: this is me trying to prove to you that I won't doing anything</span><br />
[04:49:58] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: these are things i've created for fighting</span><br />
[04:50:30] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: and right now, if its what you want me to do...</span><br />
[04:50:34] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: I will destroy them all</span><br />
[04:51:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[04:51:08] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: What I want you to do, is to let go of all that contempt you have for EQ. To distance yourself from the issue so you can think rationally.</span><br />
[04:51:21] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: So then you want me to leave</span><br />
[04:52:02] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm asking you to stop thinking about it as EQ needs to be dealt with because they you.</span><br />
[04:52:21] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm asking you to start thinking about it as EQ needs help, and you're willing to give it.</span><br />
[04:53:02] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: that's what I was thinking...</span><br />

[04:55:18] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: what my original plan was...</span><br />
[04:55:35] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: was to either try and be diplomatic</span><br />
[04:55:46] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: or try and stop Athena by force</span><br />
[04:55:51] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: prefereably the latter</span><br />

[04:56:56] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: Oh wait...</span><br />

[04:59:51] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: she's apperently placed even more trust in Athena now thanks to that little strife we had</span><br />
[05:02:19] <span style="color:#00c1c1">CTV: this is why keeping something so serious secret is a bad idea, because she like this goes down... It's my fault for strifing but still</span><br />
