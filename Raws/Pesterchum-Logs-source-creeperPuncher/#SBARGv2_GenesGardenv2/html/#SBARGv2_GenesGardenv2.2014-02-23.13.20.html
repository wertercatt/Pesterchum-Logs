<span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Vaguely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: I mean, I don't understand how your AU machine works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Simulates a full quantum reality based on existing parameters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, an Import function pulling in megaman battle network stuff.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I wonder how it'd parse a NetHack AU...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Likely with fanart to generate the living creatures.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, its not going to have us visually run as text, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Wait, isn't nethack turn based?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...good point...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: turnbased could be parsed as realtime for singleplayer, but not multiplayer...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's what I mean by realtime... and yeah, I guess dropping the turnbased concept entirely works.</span><br />

<span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: But can it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But if you can force the import to get it so only one universe would fit... Yes, It can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless said AU would affect reality outside of the Machine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...which I haven't actually tested.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I currently have a large amount of AU's off limits, due to code corruption.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: These tend to be the ones with massive amounts of time travel, or dimentional travel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: ..How much time travel is considered "massive"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doctor Who.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Certain types of time travel, like groundhog day loops are fine.</span><br />
