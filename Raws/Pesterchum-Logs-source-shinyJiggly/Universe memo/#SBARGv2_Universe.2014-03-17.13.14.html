<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, quick question</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: did anyone manage to save any ectobiology equipment?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't think so? why? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No reason, just wondering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it came up in my talk with PA yesterday... we forgot to figure out how to bring it through the door with us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which means repopulation's gonna be harder than normal</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless we swipe one from another planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, we know frog temples are on planets in this universe, so there /are/ sessions we could steal the meteors off of the planets from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where they crash/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I suppose that's true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...eh its likely a shitty idea anyway and noone will listen to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... considering we technically /do/ need to repopulate (even if there are other humans in the universe), and our group isn't enough to be a stable gene pool (ignoring animaltier shenans)... I'd be willing to at least pay attention to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how the hell would we use antimatter to make a stable gene pool</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It makes no sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All it really is good for is for turning matter into raw energy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: usually in big explosions</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, and in the creation of /exotic matter/ which takes massive amounts of energy</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you do realize Kim said animal-tier not antimatter? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I forgot a hyphen apparently, I said "animal-tier".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh woops</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shows were /my/ brain is going all the time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: clearly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously I could like help form the mythbusters in this new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...heck, I think they could do a spin-off series on sburb game mechanics /alone/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Can a fetch modus be used to create an infinite energy device?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Cause an item carried by a card is weightless as it is carried, so... maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well its not that its weightless, more like its mass is in a pocket universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that it would be great for carrying heavy materials into orbit for a /lot/ less fuel needed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh, oh, I know!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Use encryption modus to captcha layers of safes over and over again then drop it torwards a meteor!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, it would be nice to see if it stops gaining mass after a point, or if it can get enough to create a gravitational pull that we can feel!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets /not/ go past that second point though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't wanna find out the worse case scenario if we make it to that point.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One Chronos level player was enough, we don't need /twenty/.</span><br />
