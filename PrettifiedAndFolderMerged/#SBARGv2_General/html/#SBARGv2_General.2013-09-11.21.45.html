<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: omg</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I heard an HD remake is coming out ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Actually, the ʃtuff they've done to Wind Waker wouldn't run on the 3Dʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: all the crazy dynamic ʃadowʃ and ʃit iʃ a bit much for it.  Like, the ʃunʃetʃ reflect realiʃtic natural lighting now</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm trying to think of an example of a co-op similar to what I'm thinking of for the link and zelda thing :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: not saying they would be a couple, but you know the battle couple trope, SS? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's kind of like, they'd be fighting together and adventuring together and side by side :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: there's a few problems with my idea :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but it might be interesting to think of :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: i think it'd be intereʃting to have 3 characterʃ....but that'ʃ juʃt me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: like, a Wiʃdom, Courage, and Power character</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ooh :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: so like :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: legend of zelda, but with a party? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: would be a great way to get Ganon out of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Yeah, ʃorta</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: kind of seems like more of an action rpg :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but it could be a good idea :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: The problem iʃ trying to figure out a way to make Courage mechanically diʃtinct from the otherʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: like, Courage iʃ Courage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: idk.  either way, having Link travel with ʃomeone elʃe would be nice</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSJ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What if it was something like four swords, though, where it had to be two player :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: that'd be intereʃting</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: which I don't know if that idea will be good or not, but someone control zelda, someone else control link :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: would piʃʃ everyone the fuck off though</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: ooooooh</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: that could work though</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like, link getʃ ʃkyward ʃword controlʃ</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ooh yeah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: ʃe could have like, a ʃelection of ʃpellʃ and ʃtuff on there</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: though maybe it doesn't have to be two player, just that it was an option and would work better as two player co-op :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ..like that one minigame in that one WiiU game? except with different characters?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: maybe :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: and you'd draw the ʃpell ʃigilʃ to activate the ʃpellʃ ore ʃomething...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJphones [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I sorta didn't like how Four Swords kinda marginalized the athmosphere into a more party-like thing. Maybe I'm just weird like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: You weren't the only one, SJ. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: i'd alʃo love an archer Zelda, but that'd be hard with the Game Pad...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What I was thinking, too, is that since Link can use both magic and equipment, so can Zelda, but like, one is better suited for the other. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Like, take how Link'ʃ a maʃter of all tradeʃ, and give ʃome of that to Zelda, forcing cooperation and uʃe of both characterʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Link will more often use sword and shield, and Zelda will more often use magic and spells, but they can both use both. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Link'ʃ ʃpell ʃelection would be limited, while Zelda'ʃ equipment ʃelection would be limited</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: :D :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And just imagine the arrow battle on horseback with ganon in Twilight Princess. Now imagine both Link and Zelda doing that :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: god.  the thingʃ you could do with boʃʃ battleʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah. It reminds me a bit also of the final battle against ganon in wind waker :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Zelda sorta helped out there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: With what I'm thinking of, there could be bosses where if they tried to go solo, it wouldn't be enough and they'd have to use both of their skills. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: definitely</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: one thing i'd love to ʃee changed for all Zelda'ʃ alwayʃ:  no more acquiring equipment in dungeonʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ooh :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Although I kind of liked the acquiring equipment in dungeons :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: like, acquire the bloody thingʃ in a realiʃtic manner</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: but maybe instead :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: you get it right before the dungeon :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: haha :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I've been so frustrated backtracking before :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though they have to make sure that they hint that you need to backtrack, and it hast to be a consistant thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: too much backtracking sucks though x-x</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I love it.  Cauʃe it meanʃ there'ʃ more ʃtuff to find</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: like go halfway through a dungeon, then realize you don't have the right equipment or not enough of the equipment and have to leave :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like with some dungeons, running out of arrows and none of the pots will give you arrows. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I juʃt love the whole dungeoneering adventure thing.  Making ʃure you have the right ʃtuff, going to get the right ʃtuff.  It ʃpeakʃ to me on a ʃpiritual level</span><br />
