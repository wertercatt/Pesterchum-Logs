<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#165b0d">CURRENT knaveofHearts [CKH]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: I don't think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#165b0d">CKH: But if I get banned, we'll know why it happened.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: k... :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait what? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#410f41">CURRENT symphonicAnima [CSA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: the initials CP</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: i have /no/ clue what's going on really</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, something related to something that's probably inapropriate that was discussed slightly a couple minutes ago ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in the memo where NN's parents aren't breathing down our necks ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I know. I realized it a few days after I made the handle (long before v2 began), but I have no other ideas for what to use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (plus no IC reason to change it, not that that matters)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm, interesting. it's possible in Notepad to override a "this file is in use, you cannot save it" by save-as-ing with a different encoding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wow</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it still overwrites the original file.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, if there's ever a v3 I'll probably have a different handle with a less-unfortunate-implicationsy initials.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I gotta go somewhere for a little bit. I'll be back online in a couple hours. start the hotel without me. ➜</span><br />
