<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I just got a note from my futureself, but it's on the hotel RP blog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do not wish to "fuck shit up"  as you say</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I am not an AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am your friend, Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe they didn't - or couldn't - pester you in a memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I just KNOW I'm messing with myself here, it doesn't even have a clear confirmation on what exactly's going to happen during that event that I'm going to be worried about enough to post a note about.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........pregnant silence? ^O_O^</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, will you please install the transmitter, so I may fix this session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sorry, I don't really think so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The logistics of fixing the session aren't anywhere near as easy as you wanna make them out to be, I'm pretty sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: At best you'll end up doing nothing of any real use, at worse you'll muck things up further</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would do it myself, but the underlings have taken out my drone launcher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe you should've bought more Drone Parts instead of blowing all your scrap on missiles :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It will be a while before I can reprogram the drones to repair it.</span><br />

response: it would take more missiles then /your body has room for/<br />

inquiry: what exactly is the "Blue Hole"<br />
wait a moment<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no. if the Blue Hole is assimilating glitches, who's to say it won't assimilate and backfire Chronos, leading to a Cy-Bug King Candy scenario?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Your right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That could make things worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: kaMi or whoever that is without a prefix: check the v2errlog tag, someone mentioned it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#004dbc">Blue Hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might be better to use the code room in an attempt to delete his code.</span><br />
yes that is much better<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it is there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...perhaps switching to nanobots would be a smarter method?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Expecially If I can adjust the code so they exist outside of time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope.avi, I've looked in there. he doesn't have a codebox since he's not "native" to this session like we are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (just saying that to get any other Code Room ideas out of your AI-is-a-crapshoot thinkpan)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (even though it's actually true, he is foreign code)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps using nanobots in order to consume him would be the best idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You do realize I can read that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I am not an AI.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why do you keep insisting I am</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, there's at least something suspicious about you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno what exactly though.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has been progammed with the three laws of robotics, considering all human life equal.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it totally is not a crapshoot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are there any specific details that you would wish to know?</span><br />

what might i call you?<br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: Maybe a crucial one: Is there a hardcoded and/or hardwired sudo-kill command for when-I-mean-"if" things go wrong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The AI may be disconnected from its power source if things go wrong. And it is known as FL-AI-M-216.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or Li-Model-216, for short.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or to shorten it even further, you can just call it LI-216.</span><br />
disparaging gesture: fart noise<br />

it was a joke.<br />
there is no need to get your human knickers into a spiral-like state<br />
