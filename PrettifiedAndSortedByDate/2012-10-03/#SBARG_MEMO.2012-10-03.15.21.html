<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#1e4181">CURRENT astraySheep [CAS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, are any of you timeplayers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Lord of Void with the SBARG Generator</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: but I prefer Knight of Doom</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#77003c">CURRENT cuttlefishyCalamity [CCC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Im a prince of space</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: There are very few time players D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#3b68a2">CURRENT gangrenePerfectionist [CGP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b68a2">CGP: I'm a Thief of Rage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: for obvious reasons probably CC</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I want to rescue the residents of my home planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b68a2">CGP: There's a Seer of Time in my team.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Hier of Heart. No time or space players on my team. :c</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b68a2">CGP: But I doubt they'll help you do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Just...you know...doom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Heir of Heart eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Saving the entire land would not work, as that would cause a paradox.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Doom is so broad and vague</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Mhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The explosion was what killed me on the quest bed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Surprisingly hard to get a good explination of the title</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lord of Blood Here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: it's easier if you use Fatum, AS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: the word for doom, fate, judgment, etc</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005682">CURRENT royalEnthusiast [CRE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005682">CRE: Prince of Heart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Oh I ment Hier of Heart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: oddly enough, Fato-Parry! :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: RIGHT</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: WHO WANTS TITLE ANALYZING</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: (enjoys this way too much)</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Lol me I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: how about your own, Prince of Space? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Okie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: I have a Prince of Space character I'll be making for a story</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My land was the land of Iron and warmth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: so any insights are nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Or that. Prine of space would be cool to listen to too</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Ill mute the memo while i do it then, Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: kk</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: brb coffee</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My title actually has to do with the iron in blood, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Well, the prince is a very headstrong and active class</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: It is destruction through the aspect of choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: So as a prince os space, I would likely fling things around at high velocities to weaponize them, Changing their size as or before they hit for maximum damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or it destroys it instead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A prince of space like this would be able to defeat any monsters or denizens at ease while at god tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And now my land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Frogs and fatigue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, you might be able to rip a hole in the fabric of space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: The land would be grey and morose, Slow paced, My consorts would be crabs, They would have very basic tribal-like communities too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: My planets quest to light the forge would be a giant puzzle that took up most of the planet, Yet the pieces were way too small or too large.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My consorts were Komodo Dragons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: So i would have to ascend to godhood to be able to light my forge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And then the heat and light from the forge would liven my planet up, Making it faster and more colourful, Allowing me to collect frogs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: BOOM</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: alright how about mine now</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Knight of Doom</span><br />
<span style="color:#1e4181">CAS: Always fun to lisren to these</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: i have my own theories on how my classpect works but new perspectives are always nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Knight of doom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Re-muting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Also</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: Land of Decay and Fragrance</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: K</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A knight is a defensive class.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know what is fun, but might be considered a bit twisted?</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Hard to weaponize, But mainly good for protecting yourself or others from harm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A knight of doom could be either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: They could protect their allies from doom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Or protect the doom of their enemies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Causing all of the iron in the blood to shift to one side and cause the skin to begin to "rust"</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Forcing them to be taken by their doomed fate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Without them having a say in the matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And your land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: I'd say your land would be a large and colourful land, Seemingly nice, With your consorts being a brightly coloured rodent, But all of this is "Fragrance" covering the decay of the planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, sending ALL the blood to the head to make it explode works as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: The planet would slowly be dying, From the repercussions of the rodents destroying the land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: It would become dangerous, And not a nice to place to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Your quest would be to stop and revert the effects of your consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#e24b00">CURRENT crypticFox [CCF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e24b00">CCF: Mine next o:</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b68a2">CGP: How about my friend's?</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#3a4961">CURRENT anomalousEntity [CAE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: Are pesters sent to people offline at the time of the pestering still furthered to them when they log on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Give me a moment to unlag the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: as for the title itself, yeah that's close to what I imagine</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Rig)(t</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: I imagine my character would be able to alter fate so that his strikes are inevitable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b68a2">CGP: My friend's land and title make no sense together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e24b00">CCF: Can I go next?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e24b00">CCF: &gt;3&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b68a2">CGP: And the land makes 0 sense anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Who wants a go now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CDJ: at least his own fate</span><br />

<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: My take on heart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Is Emotion</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: A seer of heart would be able to gauge the emotional stability of their friends or foes, And either repair their friends, To keep them sane in this dangerous game, Or break down their opponents mental walls, Driving them round the bend, And making them more available to be hit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Your land, Would be blank on the top.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: With small brick houses, Empty inside, But with stairs to a cellar.</span><br />

<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Candles will be dotted sparingly, Pockets of safety,</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Often with your consorts huddled inside them, Hoping to not be caught by the "horrors"</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Woop</span><br />

<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: The consorts seem to dislike outsiders, Babbling poetic nonsense between themselves, You cant understand them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: Your land itself would be smart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: You could blink</span><br />
<span style="color:#77003c">CCC: And what had once been a bridge was now a zipwire across a raging canyon</span><br />
