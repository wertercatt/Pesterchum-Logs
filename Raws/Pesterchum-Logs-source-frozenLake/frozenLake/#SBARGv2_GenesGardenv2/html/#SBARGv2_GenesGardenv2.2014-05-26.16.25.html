[16:55:18] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I'd reckon we shouldn't mess with it though.</span><br />
[16:57:59] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: I understood like maybe one word there.</span><br />
[16:59:20] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Basically, don't activate an FTL drive while anywhere near that crack in the sky... that I can only see when I use the Dark Visor setting on my shades, which I /guess/ is kinda voidy?</span><br />

[17:29:17] <span style="color:#baba00">CAE: Why's that?</span><br />
[17:29:56] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Because I would just be replacing a version of me thats already there... that hasn't been changed by the game.</span><br />
