Don't be a jerk and remember to have fun!</span><br />
[13:52:11] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: oh good she isn't on</span><br />
[13:52:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#c797ee">CURRENT lavenderSiren [CLS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[13:52:17] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: hi there</span><br />
[13:52:54] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: what brings you to this little memo?</span><br />
[13:53:52] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: To be fair, being bored.</span><br />
[13:54:09] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ah, okay then.</span><br />
[13:54:41] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: pretty bored over here too.</span><br />
[13:54:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Would you like any of my recipes?</span><br />
[13:55:03] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: what kind?</span><br />
[13:55:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alchemy</span><br />
[13:55:13] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: punchcard alchemy?</span><br />
[13:55:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Can't use it anymore here, so I figure /maybe/ I could make a book.</span><br />
[13:55:35] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But helping others with it works too.</span><br />
[13:55:41] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ooh that might be cool</span><br />
[13:56:01] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: and wait, why can't you use it anymore?</span><br />
[13:56:33] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alchemy doesn't work in our universe.</span><br />
[13:56:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I think it might be lack of proximity to sburb.</span><br />
[13:57:15] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: man, that sucks.</span><br />
[13:57:52] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: so you like, have to go to the supermarket every week or something?</span><br />
[13:58:00] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah, if I knew that, I might have just stayed behind in the session and combine games.</span><br />
[13:58:19] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Oh, we have replicators, the alchemized stuff still works, we just can't make new stuff.</span><br />
[13:58:36] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: okay then...</span><br />
[13:59:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And don't tell her this, but I kinda am paranoid that something is gonna slip past Emmy and kill our universe.</span><br />
[13:59:23] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ...Emmy?</span><br />
[13:59:48] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And to answer the obvious question, Emmy is a robot bird made by our first guardian... that lost his powers upon going through the door with us.</span><br />
[14:00:05] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: o_O</span><br />
[14:00:18] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, I don't see any green sun sparking at least, so thats what I assume.</span><br />
[14:00:26] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: He might still have the powers hidden for all I know</span><br />
[14:00:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: At least he can still talk.</span><br />
[14:01:23] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: this is really confusing @ _@</span><br />
[14:01:45] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: tl:dr, the ultimate reward isn't all its really cracked up to be.</span><br />
[14:01:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#688e2e">CURRENT stealthyCalligrapher [CSC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[14:01:51] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: welp</span><br />
[14:02:09] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: okay then.</span><br />
[14:02:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But I bet us not being able to access it would make us want it even more... forbidden fruit and all of that</span><br />
[14:03:04] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: probably.</span><br />
[14:03:39] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: just wondering, are you any good with weird puzzles?</span><br />
[14:04:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Our session seed was a weird puzzle.</span><br />
[14:04:35] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: so, I'll take that as a yes then?</span><br />
[14:04:35] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And we named a cafe after it, but that doesn't matter.</span><br />
[14:04:56] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, I'm not really good myself... it got pretty tough near the end.</span><br />
[14:05:04] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: expecially that timesten shit</span><br />
[14:05:25] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: what the heck is a timesten</span><br />
[14:05:55] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (seriously, fuck chronos for that shitty puzzle of shit that was only a request for flowers from our resident bowl of noodles wearing player)</span><br />
[14:06:22] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ...</span><br />
[14:06:41] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: yeaaaaah</span><br />
[14:06:51] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ........</span><br />
[14:07:14] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: so... I take it you're one of those post-reset folks?</span><br />
[14:07:36] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Honestly, the only thing that was more bullshit was horrizon nocturne, which was OP for a fraymotif</span><br />
[14:07:44] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
[14:08:00] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: weren't you here for that shitstorm a few days ago?</span><br />
[14:08:16] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: probably.</span><br />
[14:08:22] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: in the memo yeah</span><br />
[14:08:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But erm, this is the closest i'm going to be able to get with contact, chances are.</span><br />
[14:09:09] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: at least it's something.</span><br />
[14:09:19] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: too bad that contact allows for destruction of computers</span><br />
[14:09:44] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alright, but um... alright...</span><br />
[14:09:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Do you have a copy of a sonic game, by any chance?</span><br />
[14:10:09] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: let me check...</span><br />
[14:10:23] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (06 is the most useful, since it has those gems)</span><br />
[14:10:41] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (Which was my main method of interplanetary flight.)</span><br />
[14:11:46] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: darn it, all I have on me are my DS games and I don't have any sonic games for the DS anymore.</span><br />
[14:12:22] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: (and some weird game called breavely default but I'm pretty sure that's not a sonic game)</span><br />
[14:12:27] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: *bravely</span><br />
[14:12:31] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alright uh, let me see if I still have it... oh wait, it likely got blown up.</span><br />
[14:12:34] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...fuck.</span><br />
[14:12:55] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: welp</span><br />
[14:13:08] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Okay uh, if any of my friends pop on here, could you ask them if they have a copy of Sonic 06 I could borrow?</span><br />
[14:13:16] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: why?</span><br />
[14:13:33] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Because I'm going to check any recipes I have for it.</span><br />
[14:13:39] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: With the Recipe Modus.</span><br />
[14:13:52] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (seriously that shit is the bomb <span style="color:#ff0000">â™¥</span>)</span><br />
[14:13:56] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: isn't sonic 06 like... that one game that was so horrible that it retconned itself?</span><br />
[14:14:18] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Our entire session was shitty games, didn't you know?</span><br />
[14:14:39] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I find that hard to believe.</span><br />
[14:14:49] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: We had big rigs backing off into infinty and crashing into themselves!</span><br />
[14:15:01] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: o_O</span><br />
[14:15:12] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: was there ever a crazy bus?</span><br />
[14:15:22] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Don't think so</span><br />
[14:15:28] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: We had a space bus though</span><br />
[14:15:45] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I think it was made by a goat player</span><br />
[14:15:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...that ended up being wiped from existance.</span><br />
[14:16:08] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: o-o;;;</span><br />
[14:16:21] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I blame the blue hole.</span><br />
[14:16:36] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ...</span><br />
[14:16:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: sorry, <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span></span><br />
[14:18:11] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: so let me get this straight, this blue hole thingie I've been hearing about can really do that? Like, I've heard it was realy really destructive and all, but seriously? wiping things from existence itself???</span><br />
[14:18:22] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well, it is a giant error</span><br />
[14:18:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And in the game, when it comes down to it, we can be visualized as simply code</span><br />
[14:19:35] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: And it /was/ leaking into the magicant, so... yes?</span><br />
[14:19:47] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: o_O;;;;</span><br />
[14:19:58] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: You guys had a magicant in your session, right? I can't remember.</span><br />
[14:20:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But it /was/ pretty bad.</span><br />
[14:20:42] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: If we did, I never found it while the session was still a thing.</span><br />
[14:20:50] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alright</span><br />
[14:21:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So I guess you have read the glitch faq?</span><br />
[14:21:08] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: yep</span><br />
[14:21:26] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: one of the few scraps of reading material available out here.</span><br />
[14:21:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, for a bit we were concerned that we would be repeating sessions when we went through the door, but... that wasn't the case.</span><br />
[14:21:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Okay, what other scraps do you have?</span><br />
[14:22:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: You have homestuck, right?</span><br />
[14:22:21] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: yeah, and has been updating regularly.</span><br />
[14:22:25] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...oh man please tell me the gigapause didn't already end for you-</span><br />
[14:22:27] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: oh.</span><br />
[14:22:33] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: gigapause?</span><br />
[14:22:42] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So you're in the past of that.</span><br />
[14:23:04] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: is the gigapause a huge spoiler for later?</span><br />
[14:23:05] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Well uh... have a nice two years!</span><br />
[14:23:15] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ...</span><br />
[14:23:29] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: without any updates.</span><br />
[14:23:35] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: oh.</span><br />
[14:23:44] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: wait no its only been one year so far</span><br />
[14:23:46] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: ........</span><br />
[14:23:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ah well</span><br />
[14:23:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: well, slightly less</span><br />
[14:24:06] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: my point is, the updates are going to stop for a long time soon.</span><br />
[14:24:15] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Whats the most recent update you got?</span><br />
[14:24:38] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: let me check real quick... ((checking date matchups...))</span><br />
[14:25:31] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ((Jan 30th 2013 apparently, attemting to check update on that day...))</span><br />
[14:26:08] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: darn it, mspa is loading really slow.</span><br />
[14:26:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: (( www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007699 ))</span><br />
[14:27:16] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I'm at this one: <a href='http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT6ACT5ACT1x2COMBO.php?s=6&p=007699'>http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT6ACT5ACT1x2COMBO.php?s=6&p=007699</a></span><br />
[14:27:38] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Oh, so right after the trickster shenanigans.</span><br />
[14:27:46] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: yeah....</span><br />
[14:28:09] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah, that shit was terrifying.</span><br />
[14:28:39] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: yeah. the cool clicky bar thing on top was fun to play with though.</span><br />
[14:29:10] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I recognized some stuff from mario paint, yoshi's cookie, kirby superstar...</span><br />
[14:29:28] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Alright uh... do you have any betty crocker cook books?</span><br />
[14:30:07] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I know the code for an array modus off the top of my head if you need it.</span><br />
[14:30:13] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: its AAAAAAAA</span><br />
[14:30:19] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: um, I don't think so? I could probably try to find one on youtube and use the captchalogue camera to get a ghost image though.</span><br />
[14:31:07] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: note that BBBBBBBB makes a pretty useless fetch modus, that is kinda buggy</span><br />
[14:31:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: so don't make it</span><br />
[14:31:35] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: then again, I'm kinda low on grist after that positron canon some dersite wanted me to make. All I got was a set of light pens in return.</span><br />
[14:32:24] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I'm still kinda peeved that he wound up tossing it aside after how much it cost... &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
[14:32:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: did you recycle it?</span><br />
[14:33:10] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: I think he like, dis-assembled it manually or something.</span><br />
[14:33:24] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...oh</span><br />
[14:33:29] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: yeah...</span><br />
[14:34:01] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But yeah, If I remember right, BBBBBBBB makes some sort of Beta Modus thats nearly impossible to get the cards out of it</span><br />
[14:34:16] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Make it too full, and the entire thing ejects.</span><br />
[14:34:28] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: All at once.</span><br />
[14:34:30] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[14:34:46] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: sounds almost cruddier than cheap array.</span><br />
[14:35:40] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah, you have to access the cards all at once if you want them</span><br />
[14:35:54] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Its not "do you want a specifc card" its more "do you want your cards"</span><br />
[14:36:10] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: :b</span><br />
[14:36:27] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: So yeah, useless beta modus.</span><br />
[14:36:38] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: anways, is it alright if I send you a zip file of some diary page scans?</span><br />
[14:36:41] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, it /might/ be useful in combat maybe</span><br />
[14:36:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Naw, I don't wanna read a cheesy teenage diary</span><br />
[14:37:01] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: oh, like loading up on Pointy Shit and then hitting eject-all?</span><br />
[14:37:11] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Yeah, like that.</span><br />
[14:37:53] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, I doubt I would ever use it considering how full I keep my Filesystem Modus, but yeah.</span><br />
[14:38:17] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ((brb))</span><br />
[14:39:04] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: I use Animal Crossing Modus. a bit small as far as number of "cards" if you don't have a storage chest, but being able to collapse huge furniture into tiny leaves is pretty cool...</span><br />
[14:39:52] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: though considering how much Battle Network 3 I've been playing lately, I want to maybe see if a PET Modus exists, and what it's like...</span><br />
[14:39:58] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Ah, one of the themed modus.</span><br />
[14:40:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: My friend, Kimura, has this Sword Art Online modus that he waves around.</span><br />
[14:40:51] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: ((back))</span><br />
[14:41:11] <span style="color:#688e2e">CSC: hmm... cool.</span><br />
[14:41:41] <span style="color:#c797ee">CLS: anyways, I was asking about the diary scans because those have the puzzle crud on them.</span><br />
[14:41:43] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: But yeah, if you see anyone from my universe, ask around and see if anyone is still holding onto Sonic 06 so I can get you some recipes.</span><br />
[14:42:10] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: Don't you think its a test for you?</span><br />
[14:42:41] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: I mean, if you just send off your puzzles to people outside of your group, then you don't really learn much.</span><br />
[14:42:46] <span style="color:#0070e0">CFL: ...anyways, later.</span><br />
