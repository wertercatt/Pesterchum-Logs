<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  The blue room... well, how to describe the blue room? Creepy as fuck, thats it! Specimens of all size and shape are stored in shelves, on podiums, and in vats of ecto goo. And with the UV lighting... kinda creepy look to it. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  walks over towards AG --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  It just goes on and on, getting weirder and weirder. The stuffed specimines seem to now be hunching over on their podiums and spaces. It eventually reaches a dead end, the last thing being a sort of mix between a Plesiosaur and an anglerfish. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ........ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  points at the unholy genetic hybrid. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Okay, glad to help... Wait, are you all going so soooooon?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Is there any other way you can help us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we're trying to find a friend...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: One of our friends is trapped in here somewhere; we need to help her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  The weird science stuff is best left un-mentioned. It's creepy and gross and ew. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Uh... I donno! But that can wait, can't it? We can have so much fun here, and I still need to know my new friends better!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  turns invisible and slips away back to the transportaliser, seeing if it will let her out. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  ... The transportalizer won't let her out. It says that there is too high a collection of water, incoming. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  curses in Latin to herself before reappearing near the others. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Warning: too high a collection of water, incoming.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  wordlessly reequips the KSP spacesuit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  equips her water-breathing mask, bracing for impact. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Ooooh, water? I always loved water! I used to be able to breathe in water! Wanna stay for a while longer, friends?"</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn it, my breathing thingie si still gunked up with macaroni. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *is ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  hands SJ a spare fishbowl helmet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  puts it on --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: be careful though, it's at low durability...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "But... But why? Your friend can wait."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uncaptchas a duct-tape wallet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Not really, I'm afraid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  attempts to peel some duct tape off of it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Developments have meant hers might be a bit of a time-sensitive case.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  barely manages to tear off a flimsy strip --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "But... you are not gonna stay? After all this waiting? And you got me my key?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How long would you want us to stay for? And is it okay if we rescue EQ, then come back to play with you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  the room starts to rumble, and water starts leaking in from the ceiling. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sticks the tiny piece of duct tape on one of the cracks on the helmet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  it doesn't really improve anything on it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh goody. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the helmet is still watertight, it just can't take too much blunt force before it /will/ crack --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  just sorta stands there, utting the duct tape wallet away --</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Well, NO! It won't matter! You just Haaaaave to go find some worthless player, instead of being my friends, HUH?!? I thought players were nice! But No! Players, Nor Denizens are nice at all! Except for me, sit that it?!?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Would you feel better if one of us stayed with you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: You did not just call Hannah worthless, did you? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  The room starts to fill with water faster, and the abomination starts to rattle on its podium. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stares at Pallas, clearly ticked off --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And Pallas, friends have to understand that sometimes, no matter how much you /really/ want to stay and get to know someone, if you made a promise, it's really super important to keep that promise. It's okay to spend time with friends later, after that promise is filled.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "Players are such liers! They say that they will be my new friends, and then they just DIE OFF. THAT'S IT. NO TRACE. GONE. They leave, and because everything revolves around then, evrything else leaves as well!"</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "-And YOU DON'T WANNA BE FRIENDS WITH A "CREATURE" LIKE ME, IS THAT IT?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, maybe you should try protecting them? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas is clearly not listening, and the water has gotten to the point where you can freely swim in it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  gives up on diplomatising and is going swimming. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do we need to destroy the statue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: statue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't remember seeing one ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  points mutely at Pallas. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  mixed up her words whoops. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  The creature then comes to life, tearing itself from its podium, and glares at the players. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CGM: "NO NEED."</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  doggy-paddles awkwardly... the suit was meant for movement in SPAAAACE, not underwatah... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uses god tier flying powers to boost her really slow swimming speed to get the heck away --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas dives into the water, and starts to swim around. A thing that was built for water, being good at swimming. Who would have guessed? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  draws a Wands card in one hand and Pentacles in the other, shoving the wand through the rune to create a powerful lightning attack she directs at the waterlogged sea creature hybrid… thing.

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: AAAAAAAAAA ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  unequips the lower half of the suit, keeping the helmet on... there we go, swimming normally now --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aw crap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  takes splash damage from AG's attack... /why the hell would you use electric-type WHILE STANDING IN WATER?!/ --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  /due to continually accidentally electrocuting herself/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  so having made a charm for it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  gets shocked, shorting out her hat-top in the process --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is going to autopilot spam electrical attacks at Pallas. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Also what CP just... actioned. Whilst it does do quite a deal to Pallas, the water is now quite electrified, and Pallas then starts to attack in a fit of rage. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is now at like, 30% hp remaining --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  wholly unconcerned with her teammates, uses more electricity. It worked on Scylla, it'll work here... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  uncaptchas a thing of dish soap before getting knoecke out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  a zap-proof shield appears around himself and SJ --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //I guess it depends on how full the bottle is... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas is undecided weither to attack CP or AG first. But considering the fact that CP has a KO'd player, that would be a better use of time. Getting rid of two targets rather than 3. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  and sure... once. I'll allow it once.)) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  fires an exploding disc through the shield, trying to knock Pallas out or at least impair his swimming ability --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit_ <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is perfectly willing to, y'know, electrify everything again. Trying to end this quickly, she takes a bomb in each hand and shoves herself and the bombs as far towards Pallas' heart as she can get by going intangible. Then drops them, letting them regain tangibility without her doing so. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gameManagement <span style="color:#000000">[CGM]</span>  Pallas is stunned right before all that happened. She had no time to react, sadly. As the creature exploades into stuffing, the water drains away. Well, that was quick. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  drops the shield, picking up the KO'd SJ and looking over at Gambit with EXTREME CONFUSION --</span><br />
