<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is just on the ship. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  after a few minutes in transit, the Prospitian battlecruiser breaks through the atmosphere of LoWaP, arriving... probably near the consort capital --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a2a280">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  you arrive at a 3d-structure of sourts and... holy shit thats alot of spiders. they all wave and cheer as the ship approaches. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is nervous, spotting the land infront of him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which way is the bathroom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  points FL down the hall --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  himself waves from the highiest point of the capiral, a huge 'spike'/thread in the air. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  runs to the bathroom. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  points at a spot right at the outskirts of the capital, where the ship can land. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  lands the ship, pressing a few buttons once it anchors --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Locking of the door can be heard. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  a large door on the side opens up, with a ramp extending out to the land's surface --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *radio/external intercom* okay guys, ship's here. all aboard!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  the conorts move as one 'swarm', crawling around, over, and under the others as they all enter though the ramp, several car-sizespiders at the very back of the herd, driving them foward --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  eventually, they all board, some of the spider dieciding to just climb up the sides instead and enter that way. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *internal intercom* also guys, make room in there. between the Fahr Pizzaria Semi and the Big Bomb Cannon, a lot of room is already occupied...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the ship will be at about 75% capacity once the residents of LoWaP finish boarding... maybe room for two more lands' worth at the most --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  several voices from the crowd says that won' be a problem- there's enough cieling for all of them to share. remeber, wall crawlers. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, just gonna double-check... Copland, land-wide life signs scan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  you sense that there are no more spiders on the planet... but there are a shitload of underlings coming your way. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  the external ramp rises up and retracts, followed by the outer door closing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...by the way, what about your denizen? are they still alive?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Remeber to pick Up SJ's Bro, okay?</span><br />
