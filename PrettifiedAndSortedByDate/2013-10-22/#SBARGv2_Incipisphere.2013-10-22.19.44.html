[03:20:16] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i've got a plan!</span><br />
[03:20:19] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: lots of smoke.</span><br />
[03:20:22] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: it puts bees to sleep!</span><br />

[03:20:51] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: more bee trouble?</span><br />
[03:20:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm not going to go to war with an entire species of consorts.</span><br />
[03:21:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They think I have their Queen.</span><br />
[03:21:15] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: then go to war with a small section of them.</span><br />
[03:21:43] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: why not smoke?</span><br />
[03:21:52] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: just big old smoke bombs</span><br />
[03:22:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyway, I have managed to gather some info.</span><br />
[03:22:52] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's true actually... on one of NV's sidequests, someone crashed into a hive full of Bee Tiers. I threw a smoke grenade, and they calmed down...</span><br />
[03:23:01] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: That's basic beekeeping.</span><br />
[03:23:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently, the Queen went missing after the first main batch of us entered... and before I started selling Honey to my consorts.</span><br />
[03:24:21] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: bee tiers!</span><br />
[03:24:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Bee tiers.</span><br />
[03:24:51] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: maybe i'm a bee hero!</span><br />
[03:25:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe, maybe nt.</span><br />
[03:25:41] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do you feel a deep sense of pride when you see Bee Movie?</span><br />
[03:25:47] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do you see Bee Movie on a regular basis?</span><br />
[03:25:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unfortunately, Bee Tiers are not Animal Tiered players that got prototyped with bees. no, they're actual GT'd bees.</span><br />
[03:26:09] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i've never seen bees!</span><br />
[03:26:18] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: but i'd love to have little bee wings or something that'd be cool</span><br />
[03:26:56] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: how the fuck do bees GT?</span><br />
[03:27:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm thinking that since this happened soon after entry, the dwelling spire might be a good place to check out... however, we would need to break through the clouds.</span><br />
[03:28:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So chances are we would need a Breath player.</span><br />
[03:29:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or something else that could deal with the wall of clouds.</span><br />
[03:29:17] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: Why are clouds so difficult to deal with?</span><br />
[03:29:18] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Okay</span><br />
[03:29:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SR, would /you/ fly through a wall of storm clouds?</span><br />
[03:30:14] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: breath player ain't gonna make the electrical charge go away. That's why you have a lightning rod.</span><br />
[03:30:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, there is the matter of the /flying apples of death/</span><br />
[03:30:42] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: or a rubber suit. Whatever.</span><br />
[03:31:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its likely a game construct.</span><br />
[03:31:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, regarding the clouds, PO and I managed to clear DSpace's land of an ion storm fine and neither of us are Breath players...</span><br />
[03:31:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, maybe.</span><br />
[03:31:45] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: these things don't really sound like huge problems!</span><br />
[03:31:59] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: like if it gets stormy make a lightning rod, and if there's bees then smoke them out</span><br />
[03:32:24] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: and just eat the apples. Apples are yummy. It'll be like...extreme bobbing-for-apples.</span><br />
[03:32:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, just... whenever you get a plan for this, lemme know and I'll definitely help.</span><br />
[03:32:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its either apples or cherries</span><br />
[03:32:41] <span style="color:#00027c">CSR: I have faith in y-no, I don't, I can't even finish the sentence.</span><br />
[03:32:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((as long as it's not this friday night, I have a halloween party to go to))</span><br />
[03:33:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, how did everything go after that rock fell on my head?</span><br />
[03:33:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With the barrier dungeon?</span><br />
[03:33:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the what now?</span><br />
