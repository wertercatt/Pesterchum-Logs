<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I know that part of the game's "plot" is that we're supposed to prove ourselves as the rightful owners of our lands...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Then once I regain control... I'm going to switch to democracy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And maintain power /only/ as a figurehead.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Did you guys ever see pictures of that boxed in server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I do, but in most areas it's buried under several meters of snow or in permafrost form.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On minecraft?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the ones from Super Paper Mario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember the Golden Apple stupidity on my land a LONG time ago?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: how could I forget that</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, my Light/Void fray is still listed as ???s and apparently is only obtainable as dungeon loot...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently the Ikaruga chapter titles represent Man's struggle to enlightenment..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And the Ikaruga itself is a mans sould?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: soul*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the Ikaruga symbolizes a man's soul.</span><br />
