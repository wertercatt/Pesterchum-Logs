<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: He died?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. stupidly, I might add.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...okay uh, I guess he should be reviving soon if the timeline is stable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Otherwise, either me or you is doomed. Not both, just... one of us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...I hope it isn't you guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: He's gonna revive again just as stupidly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if I had just not slept through it ((or if SOMEONE hadn't forced the event to happen when I was offline!)), neither he nor Kat would be dead right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...So um, where did he die?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Man you guys cheat death more than the spirits do</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...though to be honest, I'm not sure if this timeline being Doomed would actually be /preferable/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Trollian is pointing me at the bar, but I don't see him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Its really weird.</span><br />

<span style="color:#8c7ea1">CIM: ((not in the same place but okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Because its here, there, and everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...yeaaaah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: hah</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...so, looks like one of us is doomed, unless I can trick the timeline somehow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Actually, did he use up his life revival?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I can't remember, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he died from a Chaos Dunk that was clock manipul8ted, we tried to get Kat to revive him but she chickened out... he was later revived by non-Lifey means...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Then he died when he tried to attack me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Alright, but I heard that was chip rebooted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that one was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Which isn't gonna happen this time due to his brain being in pieces.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...Could someone evacuate his mountain? Its kinda starting to flood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: With Lava.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: ...Lava?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So where's this mountain?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........that wasn't supposed to happen yet either.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I need to do a firebending lesson and that'd be perfect</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Yeah I figure all of those quakes must have broken the containment or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: But yeah, if you don't fix it... well, you might lose internet access.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Whatever, I'll fix it, lava's my strong suit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Unless the Server is truely indestructable as he claimed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's motherbarking squiddle-tech, it BETTER be indestructible.</span><br />

<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Am I to believe unfortunate events are indicative of the very nature of time being amiss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: debateable as to if that's the case, but can't rule it out. especially considering /yesterday/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: That's convenient.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Assuming you're not full of it or misinformed, time itself conspires to keep your mistakes out of the forefront?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. but only for REALLY major things... and only if they actually already involved time being messed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((PESTERCHUM I S2G IF YOU LAG OUT AGAIN))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, doomed timelines seem to be more prevalent within a sburb session than outside one...</span><br />

<span style="color:#8c7ea1">CIM: ((strange it didn't boot me off))</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unless you have fire shielding, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm not gonna flood it with water because hot things cooling quickly have a habit of shattering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Well, as it cools down, the problems with the heat should lessen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's why I'm doing it gently with Galestorm. windy thing instead of wet thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Considering the memo seems to have stablized, it has likely seemed to managed to repair that... you should be able to connect to other alternate universes again soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: However, there still is the issue of two deaths on our hands that we must worry about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: It may be a wise investment to start creating soulbots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Which two seem to have been partially built in one of the upper floors of the mountain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Sadly, they do not seem to be bipedal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: One seems to be an odd cross between bipedial and quadpedal... but I don't really know how it would work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: between bipedal and quadrupedal?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Hey</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: yes, sorry for the misspelling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...if that's a centaurbot I'm punching a wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Why are you so afraid of death?</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: It is unlikely that FL was the one that built it though, as some of the components seem to be beyond his capibilitys. Perhaps they were being built on commission.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: I will attempt to feed the energy running to the AU Machine to the rest of the mountain so the elevator doors can be opened remotely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: ...woops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: Alright, lets try to filter some of the power off it... not nearly as much though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: If you would kindly make your way up to the floor I just opened, that would be great.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What's it made of</span><br />
<span style="color:#80c0ff">?DN: If you can find the punch card key for it, you should be able to get in though.</span><br />
