<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, uh... can we have a vote on weither to have this dungeon be on saturday or now?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I... think it's been decided that it's happening IC-now...</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I just think the time shenanigans are worst if we just pretend it happened then and only just start reacting to it now</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Poll is split.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Why does anyone want it to have happened ICly on saturday</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm 0kay with it either way, but according to Rule Zero and that RS is the dungeon GM, "officially" it would have happened today.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: When did this become a battle between order and chaos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: idk don't see any Denizens around</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thing is, FL already mentioned running out of healing items in the past, and visited ashes place commenting about the GUN Drive which came back and hit him in the face, and that lead to the shipping wall...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you change that, it causes one HELL of time shenanigans, much worse than the one you would have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which is why my ORIGINAL assumption, and the one that's the most temporally safe, is that we did OOC-saturday's part IC-saturday, /left the dungeon and went home/, and /returned IC-today to finish/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If FL didn't know about the shipping wall, he would never bring it up on the memo, causing the wall to be unerased.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But didn't FA post it online?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, but then AshSprite white painted it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And you know what sure CP's makes the most temporal sense never mind locks on dungeons whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That'st he thing we did</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright. </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now it makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so before i introduce my new character: are we going with the idea presented in the comic that things like strife specibi and the echeladder existed before sburb started?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug.gif</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: because the new guy's basic concept is "douchey investment banker" and i want to know if his savings are in boonbucks or usd, essentially</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: that is, will he be able to come in and immediately buy everything the consorts are selling</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: anybody?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I went with the assumption that that stuff wasn't around pre-entry, personally</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but its never really come up before outside of assumptions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh my :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I thought of things in the shower :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: thats never good</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well, they weren't bad things :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: go on</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'll discuss as soon as I put clothes on :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: why wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Alrighty. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, that was one heck of a shower speedrun...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: the frames saved</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'll discuss regardless, but first, is NN in da house? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Okay. Well, regardless, on to what I'll say. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: You know about gender roles and stuff, right? Like, masculine, feminine? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: yes...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well, even though I'm pretty conscious about "you can be whatever -ine or no -ine or both -ine, cis or not cis" I still sort of subconsciously have the roles in my head. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: as a side note, if i have a son i am going to do whatever i can to keep masculine gender roles from embedding themselves into his subconcious</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Where I'm like consciously "many people don't adhere to that, you don't adhere to that" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But then subconsciously :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: because the need to hide my emotions in particular has fucked me up so much</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Sometimes I think about referring to AG as he instead of she :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And luckily I never do. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: yeah, pronouns are tricky for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Most of the time I just do AG and not he or she. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: especially when someone uses like "they" or "xe"</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#41742f">CURRENT nearlyNonexistent [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">whoops</span> I am here</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">xe</span> is bullshit</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">imo</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">okay</span> so gender roles</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: But still, sometimes it's like I forget AG's own gender and be like "AG is male, right?" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">well</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span>'re pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: well i try to refer to people with whatever pronouns they prefer if i can help it</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">they</span>'re pretty much something you can't help</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Sure, EP, I am if you want me to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> we got rid of all the existing gender roles</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">new</span> ones would appear</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: 99% of the time i dont remember anyone's gender whether they're cis or trans</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Sure. Probably. But I'm just like, whatever roles someone decides they want to have are their own business. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> all gender role perceptions were "deleted"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so if i accidentally misgender somebody on here, which i dont think i have yet, dont take it too personally because i do it to everybody i dont know irl</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">the</span> majority of women and men would go off and do what the majority wants</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah, anyway, my whole point is, sometimes in my head when I don't realize it, I think of AG as a guy. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">and</span> those would become the new gender roles</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">even</span> if they're silly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: well like i say i am going to fight my hypothetical future son being told to hide his emotions</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: because that has fucked me up personally in so many ways</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't want kids.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i actually really do</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but if you dont thats pretty much your business</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: but like its a relationship dealbreaker for me if she doesn't want kids</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i really want to raise another human being for some reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: This might sound really mean, but I think I have this dislike for kids or something. Like, there are plenty of cool kids, and when I was a kid, kids were cool, but then there are a lot of annoying ones. I was both annoying and cool, but still, the annoying part is the part I dislike. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">one</span> of the saddest part of my situation is that I can't get pregnant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm just like "damn them brats" and stuff. I'm not some grumpy old man, mind you. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: you can always adopt nn</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s not the same.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: or maybe even find a transman to carry your child :p</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Another one of those subconscious things. If I see a kid that's cool, I'm probaby still going to think, even if I don't mean it "that kid's a brat" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">um</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: &gt;assuming I'm straight</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: or a ciswoman iunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: biological woman is my point here</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s just kind of depressing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i cant even imagine</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> duNNo how to really explain it myself</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: i mean i understand it on a conceptual level but i dont really know anyone who is openly trans irl</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CSL: so its just one of those things that happens to Other People</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">with</span> me it's just wishing I was more feminine all the time</span><br />
