[08:08:38] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: The only way that would work at all would be if as soon as you entered, everything you have on your computers and downloaded onto them later is stored on YOU instead of the computers</span><br />

[08:08:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: linked cloud</span><br />
[08:08:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats /exactly/ how it works</span><br />
[08:09:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meaning, the metadata generated for the computer is a playerID/cloudID and nothing more.</span><br />
[08:09:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes</span><br />
[08:10:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Life is very, very fun right now.</span><br />
[08:10:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[08:10:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: metadata can also carry for, say as an example, someone's text color</span><br />
[08:10:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or current modus in usage</span><br />
[08:11:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so, when you alchemize plain cruxite (pointless to do) it takes the color of your text</span><br />
[08:11:22] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: But that doesnt explain why when I use other computers that I havent set up for my quirk dont have it</span><br />
[08:11:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and when you alchemize a captcharoid camera, it carries over the colors of your current fetch modus</span><br />
[08:12:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know how to explain that</span><br />
[08:13:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: try rebooting your computer if you have that issue, and if it keeps it, then its a bug.</span><br />
[08:14:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or someone broke your alchemiter</span><br />
[08:14:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know for a /fact/ that items made with the pocket alchemiters have a forced metadata value of zero</span><br />
[08:15:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so you get stuff like black cruxite, and computers that don't have anything on them other than an OS</span><br />
[08:15:37] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#887000">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:15:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh god who cares about any of this</span><br />
[08:15:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: what does it matter</span><br />
[08:15:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay SL</span><br />
[08:15:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you can take over</span><br />
[08:16:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and tell PK that it doesn't matter</span><br />
[08:16:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because it really doesnt</span><br />
[08:16:12] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: take over what</span><br />
[08:16:14] <span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
[08:16:32] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i just came in and saw you sperging all over everything</span><br />
[08:16:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: reality isn't going to change if he doesn't believe it, so why the fuck should i care</span><br />
[08:16:54] <span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: what</span><br />
[08:16:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: later</span><br />
[08:16:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: night</span><br />
