[10:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: There were 2 of the HoloBaoth Libraries</span><br />
[10:31] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, the 2nd visit they did? ➜</span><br />
[10:31] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But if you mean just some other library</span><br />

[10:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { Oh, yeah okay }</span><br />
[10:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, the second visit was apparently more beneficial... they actually found out about Cal's past</span><br />
[10:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { How do I give them to you with the color codes intact? }</span><br />
[10:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: { The entire HTML file? }</span><br />

[10:32] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah, that's how it works))</span><br />
[10:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Found out a lot of good shit but nothing that'd actually be useful in a fight.</span><br />

[10:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm not on her side, that whiny little idiot and his flagrantly retarded attempt at a smear-campaign hopefully won't stick</span><br />
[10:36] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: Firstly, I demand being treated like how every feline deserves to be treated: equal to that of a king. For a day at least. Second, I want a good one-on-one fight. A lot of you cant die for forever, so whats there to loose? Lastly, I want some temporary access to your ship there. I just wanna see what it feels like to fly a spaceship, and also I can direct you to the spot easier that way.</span><br />
[10:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: with the /2/ people who actually read it</span><br />
[10:36] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: that OR</span><br />

[10:37] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: Ok that's the demands, i honeslty don't mind them</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: but then I'm not there to do them</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: If it's mimicing, dΘes th▲t me▲n it's nΘt ▲ctu▲lly the re▲l de▲l?</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: NV, at most he misunderstood you or was being a little shit</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: it happens v.v</span><br />
[10:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't think it is the real deal.</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably a little shit, I wouldn't expect much more.</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i guess one could equate it to just a reflection from a mirror then?</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: close but not the real thing</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it seems similar to being used like those copy hats from the kirby games. ➜</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like Kirby</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: then fight aspect to aspect?</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I saw her shirt /eat/ a swatch and she became a Breath hero</span><br />
[10:38] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: how does a shirt eat</span><br />
[10:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...which means the Aspect of What is literally kirby.</span><br />
[10:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And her shirt is part of an outfit, so logically I can assume she's either part-symbiote from spiderman</span><br />
[10:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: or it's a wonky ass god tier</span><br />
[10:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And the shirt's symbol like</span><br />
[10:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Did an eating-esque thing</span><br />

[10:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wonder if there's an aspect-equivilent to the sleep ability... ➜</span><br />
[10:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Y'know shirts eating things is seriously hard to describe.</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: where is its stomach</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i dont understand it</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't think it digested it</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ..Would it poop out threads?</span><br />
[10:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ....... ➜</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: can the shirt bleed? if it has blood than it can die. You can kill a shirt.</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: I</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: I kinda wanna do that.</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Does it even have internal organs?</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: Focus</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: guys</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i refuse</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: NL can you be pet?</span><br />
[10:41] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm pretty focused on this shirt.</span><br />

[10:42] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: of couse I can be pet</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh yeah.</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That works Elsey.</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and yeah i think that makes some sense</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: so that means it just takes the fabric and grows more massive?</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: hen i visit i can pet you like a kitty</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it changes the fabric and changes for</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: m</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Form</span><br />
[10:42] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: okay but</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: where does the original material of the fabit it ate go then???</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and uh</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: do you pet "kitties" the same way you do lions</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: with teeth</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and claws</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and knives</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe it gets barfed out</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: yes</span><br />
[10:43] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: ew</span><br />

[10:44] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: wait</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The way to any animal's heart is to pet it in a place it can't reach itself, obviously.</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: but for it to barf it needs stomach acid...</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: fuckit i dont get shirts</span><br />
[10:44] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: I scratch dogs at that pone spot above their tail</span><br />

[10:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Throwing out the idea that it's like attached to her physically</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe it just doesn't have stomach acid, do shirt-creatures even work like normal things</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: even less so when they start eating things</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: uh i guess thats an option?</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: terrible defence though</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i mean its not as bad a physical defence as weak skin but still</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#67009a">CAS: maybe it's not a shirt creature, maybe it's a magaical shirt nano hookup</span><br />
[10:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: If it's nano, is it also magical?</span><br />
[10:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That seems scientific to me</span><br />

[10:47] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i mean its been done before so</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean her jacket also transformed when she took on the Breath aspect.</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So did her sneakers. I wonder if it's a passive kind of thing or like</span><br />
[10:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: a god tier outfit</span><br />
[10:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or MAYBE... JUST MAYBE.. it's ... I actually have nothing.</span><br />

[10:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah that'd be really badass.</span><br />
[10:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I could totally use a color changing jacket.</span><br />
