[09:18:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( OOC ))</span><br />
[09:18:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So, what do you think it is?</span><br />
[09:18:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: FLmun wrote the puzzle to fuck with FLmuse (and the rest of the chars by extension.</span><br />
[09:18:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: *)</span><br />
[09:18:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: it makes more sense than "there's an evil clone running around", anyway.</span><br />
[09:19:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Half Right.</span><br />
[09:19:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: the other half will be revealed later I'm guessing?</span><br />
[09:19:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'll just give you the hint that this sort of dates back /way/ back to when the blue hole event happened.</span><br />
[09:20:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: ........so I was /right/ that I had been to the blackbox page before!</span><br />
[09:20:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, not the black box page</span><br />
[09:20:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I think I linked it in skype before, before I retconed it slightly to fit into the plot.</span><br />
[09:21:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Basically, back then it was a pointless puzzle made by FL since well, puzzles were sorta fun.</span><br />
[09:21:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CP: oh</span><br />
[09:22:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And now its injected into the plot as well... something similar.</span><br />
[09:22:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Might wanna read those logs Kimura~</span><br />
