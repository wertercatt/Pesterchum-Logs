[10:44] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Or snake-dogs.</span><br />
[10:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... that giant shadow in the water yesterday implies we're still looking for something big, roundish, and aquatic...</span><br />

[10:45] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So maybe a lion turtle.</span><br />

[10:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what you said last night pushed me in the right direction, but... not fully there yet.</span><br />
[10:50] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues thinking --</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  sighs, hanging her head. --</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe... maybe I'm here because I want to learn to control the power within me, and to use it constructively rather than destructively?</span><br />
[10:55] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Getting there.</span><br />
[10:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: more specific than that? hmm...</span><br />
[11:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I already said I wanted to be wiser about how I think about and do things, and to avoid any further "Charles Moments".</span><br />
[11:01] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That'd be good.</span><br />
[11:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs. "I guess that works, those two goals..." --</span><br />

[11:15] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I want balance from the spirits.</span><br />
[11:16] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Where I come from nobody even knows who the avatar is, my world was outta whack.</span><br />
[11:16] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: All I want for this one is a balance.</span><br />
[11:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I guess that makes sense.</span><br />
[11:17] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  muttered "and Skaia knows we need balance around here..." --</span><br />

[11:20] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transcendantApothesis <span style="color:#000000">[CTA]</span>  the water begins to glow a bright blue as a ghostly form swirls around under the waves, foam appearing on the surface. --</span><br />
[11:20] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Uh..</span><br />
[11:21] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So we die here, right?</span><br />

[11:23] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transcendantApothesis <span style="color:#000000">[CTA]</span>  a massive form bursts from the surface, watery falling off...and through it. It looks like a massive...kite, almost. Almost like a massive living dreamcatcher or something similar, glowing a soft blue and white with the "dreamcatcher" portion being a solid pattern of white marks leading towards a center circle which...assumedly is the eye. --</span><br />
[11:24] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I always figured this is how it'd end..</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I figured it'd end by being eaten by a horrorterror... this is actually /preferable/, in my opinion.</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transcendantApothesis <span style="color:#000000">[CTA]</span>  the ghost leans down, inspecting both of them. --</span><br />
[11:25] <span style="color:#55aaff">CTA: Why are you afraid?</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: (oh gods it can speak.)</span><br />
[11:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh...</span><br />

[11:33] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  tries to think, wondering if it's a secret test of character thing or legit "give something up" --</span><br />

[11:37] <span style="color:#55aaff">CTA: If you will give me something in exchange.</span><br />
[11:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... the only thing I can think of would be my two fire-related brush techniques, Fireburst and Inferno... but I'm not sure if you mean trading physical things or not...</span><br />
[11:39] <span style="color:#55aaff">CTA: They can be physical...or not. But fire for fire sounds like an unfair trade to a spirit.</span><br />

[11:40] <span style="color:#55aaff">CTA: If you've been so eager to learn that you'd stray from the mortal world, I'm already impressed.</span><br />

[11:45] <span style="color:#55aaff">CTA: Do you have something for me?</span><br />
[11:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I was trying to see what I have, but I can't access my inventory from here... so I need to remember what I have instead...</span><br />
[11:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((brief afk getting lunch))</span><br />

[12:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  anyway, a translucent vidwindow appears with the usual sylladex stuff, and he starts uncaptchaing all the Splash Potions of Highly Specialized Healing Effects --</span><br />
[12:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transcendantApothesis <span style="color:#55aaff">[CTA]</span>  hovers in front of CP, blank stare. --</span><br />
[12:07] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  finishes doing the thing, but also looks to see if there's anything of higher value he can give up... --</span><br />
[12:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also uncaptchas the pair of Golden Power Nodes he swiped from FL the other day, since they are explicitly /unreplicateable/ --</span><br />
[12:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //and by swiped, I mean "confiscated because he was gonna blow the entire quadrant up fighting DT" --</span><br />
[12:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: is this satisfactory?</span><br />

[12:18] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transcendantApothesis <span style="color:#55aaff">[CTA]</span>  CP's head. --</span><br />
[12:19] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT transcendantApothesis <span style="color:#55aaff">[CTA]</span>  puts another ghostly tendril where it assumes CP's doge heart to be, "hands" glowing. --</span><br />
[12:20] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  it should probably be noted that CP's in human form currently, since he was when he entered the spirit world ;) --</span><br />

[12:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (uh... I guess I'd say let them come with?)</span><br />

[12:34] <span style="color:#55aaff">CTA: I'm inhabiting your body now, the pain you felt was momentary. Think of it like a possession, the feeling will fade away when we enter the mortal world.</span><br />
