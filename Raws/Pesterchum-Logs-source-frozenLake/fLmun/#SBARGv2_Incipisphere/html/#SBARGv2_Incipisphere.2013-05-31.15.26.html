<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I've finished the memorial.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Everyone I've known and loved...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll be heading over to the base now guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll be waiting at the bench</span><br />
<span style="color:#551190">CDD: ...Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Wow, looks like I opened the memo this time. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#551190">CDD: Hahahaha, hell yeah! It's almost through!</span><br />
<span style="color:#551190">CDD: RS says he'll be at the base in a little too, we're just about done!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a feeling there's something really important about the unreadable note...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_LoIaR'>#SBARGv2_LoIaR</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAE</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so, bacafe meeting?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Yeah. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Holy shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I just found this big computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: where?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: In an area above the attic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I kind of smashed a hole in it when I kicked an imp</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Its got a bunch of wierd programs...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: particularly odd is the fact that the SBARG client has been downloaded to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: How could that be?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: The owner uses the CLEO browser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the what now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: cleowhat</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: They use the same kind of web browser as me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Hmmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its likely the Sburb cloud doing its magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: something like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: It also has a live map of the Incipisphere...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: when I first alchemized Copland, the Sbarg Server came preinstalled...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait, live map what</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: the ENTIRE Incipisphere on a map.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Its feeding everything that happens as it happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, transmit the file.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might be of some use to track chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Let me go put it on my other computer</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I sent it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...should I just let everyone access it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: it would seem that my planet has some kind of satalite...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: so does FLs and the one he is linked to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  uploads the file to the pesterchum server --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its more that skaia is transmitting the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Well I am interested in these satalites.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  instinctively starts to say "Copland, access file", but remembers he prototyped WITH the keytool --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If there even is satalites.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: ...Is THAT what that gear-shaped reflector on your back is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I can track everyone with orbits back to me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: So its either because of my planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: or someone else in the chain's.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or it could be that SKAIA IS DOING IT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, how do the clouds work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: THAT DOESN'T CONTRIDICT THAT SKAIA IS DOING IT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Skaia could have done it to someone in the chain</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: what else is on this computer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: It has a number of PDF files.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: As well as some chat client.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Its not pesterchum...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: trollian? or maybe the thing the cherubs use?</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: I thought it might be a cherub thing, but its not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or a more normal client like xchat</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Its not normal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: It has a number of special features</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: but none of them pertain to SBARG.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: It has two contacts but they are both nameless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Its just their emoticons.</span><br />
