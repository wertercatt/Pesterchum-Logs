<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In 2 and a half hours.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *Azure should be activating for the first time from his perspective.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the most he should be able to do is blow up everyones computers and such, or display rude images on the TVs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, not much of a /huge/ issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering I have managed to get it so the server is "unhackable"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so It won't be blown up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh hey PA</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, Adal supposedly knows.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: And it's not Adal's bird?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but it has giant yellow eyes and it looks like a derp</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus it's attached to FL, and was indirectly the cause of that bee swarm yesterday</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I guess I'll take it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: If you don't want the bird</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I just... figure its someone's pet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as it looks like the trees back on our home planet with its feathers instead of the trees here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and its head kinda makes me think its slightly crossed with a frog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Uh...huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so it might have been a mix up with the frog ectobiology.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if thats even possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah my guess is it would be more frog like if it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, it would kinda make sense if it was an ectobiology experement with the hypno toad, but thats... likely not the case.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not much right now, I guess. floating around on tumblr, probably gonna draw stuff later.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, just because a doomed timeline would no longer be in the way, doesn't mean he wouldn't still revive if it was a plain death.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Sounds dumb to me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what is /with/ paradox space and 413s?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess as the countdown goes down, it gets more exact?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So it might have been destined to happen that way anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is funny, cause if you ignored daylight savings, it would have been 3:14 originally</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so wait it ends in three minutes what</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, if you /ignored/ daylight savings.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sounds radioactive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You probably have a tumor or the like, Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh please</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I die, I'll just heal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and then still have a hideous growth on your face</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh yeah, I forgot you were one of /those/ god-tiers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What, the ones that don't bother to do heroic or just things?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the kind that think it's just okay to die whenever like it was going out of style. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: .....Uuu. NΘw I remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Both, actually!</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ...Kihihihihihihihihihi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I didn't think you'd guys would get it but you got both parts, I'm proud!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But yeah, the kind who just sit on their hands because they're afraid of a perma-death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT fLmun [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what did I miss</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: proud of them being cowardly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, proud of getting information right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like I lost connection</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean I'm leaving a legacy of adventure and heroic deeds, everybody knows a real man never dies, so I ain't worried.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NV, There is no afterlife.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You would understand why I would do everything in my power to stay alive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: not in your hellhole of a world there isn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i am probably going to get the raddest of afterlives</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: KIHIHIHIHIHIHIHIHI</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Uh, what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I visited the 34th deadworld like last week on a lore-quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hes from another universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's like 50 afterlives if you know how to die in style.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: if that's what you want to call it, yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh my god</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what's the 34th like</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NO</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: BAD</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: FL dΘesn't believe in the GΘlden L▲nd. Kihihihihihihi</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's okay, lotta dead guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And some girls too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wouldn't be surprised if whatever afterlife there is rejected FL for some reason. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not a lot of clothes though..</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: is it like the nude afterlife</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you will not get your promised virgins Isaac don't be a suicide bomber</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: wait what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not a whole lotta nude afterlives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I went to the 27th and it was freezing though, that was a weird quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Kihihihihihihi. FL will never ▲rrive in the GΘlden L▲nd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how many afterlifes are just a black void of nothingness?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I helped a guy get along to Valhalla too, that was a legendary quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not a whole lot!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you know how many dead people there are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: A lot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my luck just sucks then</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that sounds fucking rad. valhalla.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So there's like, at least 50 deadworlds I know about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least, for the first time I died.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just full of dead people! Afterlives for days.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or eternities.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one last week I got to spend time as a ghost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well then do something important. earn your keep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: until Kimura put my head back together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably because you had unfinished business, or didn't do anything to earn it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you just haven't ~believed~!</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu. K▲t might be in the GΘlden L▲nd...Uuu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i hope so, elsey</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Is Kat dead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: charles killed her</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Aw man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles you're a right cunt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, at least I now have /scientific proof/ that ghosts exist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what are you talking about charles</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man, I hope you don't get a deadworld at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i've been doing that for the past few years</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and you haven't been paying attention, have you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it was an accident, I didn't know that the trees would kill her when I burnt them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: good job nerdlord</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe that's why you're not going to an afterlife.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They know you'll just mess everything up or kill the fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (well I didn't expect my skull to be shattered by a tree branch either)</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like 8th deadworld.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh man, I've never partied so hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: eternal party?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Eternal beach party.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh my god</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how much do I need to shape up to go there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably xMillion, you're pretty much the Bane of Fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a lot, that's for sure ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Remember Merlynne from the Session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The person who challenged us to BGO?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She was there</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: was Sam there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Iunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, no, he... wouldn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...great, now I don't know what to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean she was like a Muse of Fun so it makes sense /she'd/ be there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I should just let them move on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or I could finish the soulbots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: decisions, decisions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You should probably let them move on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're having a blast out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll finish the soulbots and then ask them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: does that sound like a plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: robots for holding souls?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, an awful one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: wow, why don't you do the manly thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and make a golem</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because I can't replicate magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Everybody knows dead people are supposed to stay dead, didn't you learn anything from the session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and if Kat had gone back to normal, I would have... asked her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so at what point do i get to punch charles into the deadworld of rotten eggs and raw sewage</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm not sure!</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: because he stinks</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But I'm sure it's soon!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Maybe I need to learn that other form of alchemy</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘT YΘU</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh hey Elsey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man I love these new weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, the other kind of alchemy leads to robot arms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Elsey, I'm sorry I killed your mom. I know a simple sorry doesn't solve it... but I can't fix it either, since I doubt anyone wants me to try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Literally nobody wants you to try I'd bet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: See I kinda left the planet so I could avoid death through stupidity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably a good idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I found so many awesome things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I'LL KILL YΘU BEFΘRE YΘU EVEN TRY TΘ VIΘL▲TE ▲NYTHING</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I'd be willing to help, if you're determined... because I still feel partially responsible through my absence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also elsey what</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Seriously, got a nice scythe that can open up a deadworld.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that sounds rad</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean I hate these things since ethereal farm equipment gives me the heebies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you think losing most of my limbs would be equal in value to reviving a body?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But it's a neat trick!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Charles, don't even think about it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, it'd likely be the /entire/ body PLUS a bit more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Charles you better sit your dollar ass down and do nothing before I make spatial change outta you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I could just sacrifice a bunch of fish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's just some things you shouldn't mess with. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or I swear one of your limbs is gonna be floating across space for an eternity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: YΘU'LL ΘNLY M▲KE THINGS ▲ K▲BILLIΘN TIMES WΘRSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: can you add a camera to that arm</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so i can watch armcam when i'm bored</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: //#define CONST_ETERNITY "until FL dies and revives next"</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe I'll sic some of the post-game bosses on him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, why is that commented out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seriously, /what/ post-game bosses?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not that I have any leverage with them but y'know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I /think/ its commented out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: not sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and FL, so it doesn't memo name.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You never touched the post-game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NV, THERE IS NO POST GAME</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: REVIVING THE DE▲D IS CΘMPLIC▲TED ENΘUGH WITHΘUT ▲ R▲NDΘM CH▲NCE ΘF EVERYΘNE DYING</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, I got a quest on that starter planet at the /very/ least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS NOT A GAME ANYMORE</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: didn't know there was supposed to be a post-game storyline. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well it's probably really rad whatever he or she is doing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...it never was a game in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: YΘU'LL ΘNLY BUMP THAT CH▲NCE UP TΘ 9000%</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if I do it on another planet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Will that lower the chance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's definitely really rad, and it's definitely still part game at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean, there's a million planets of lore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: MOST righteous, brotha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: or maybe it's just happenstance that you're finding all this rad stuff and it's not even game stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: that would be like. even cooler.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if I have a light player on my side?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: NΘPE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And not bother using my luck stat at all?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since its completely and utterly broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe I'm just a super nice guy and I've been mistaking this stuff for game stuff this entire time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: yΘu existing ▲lre▲dy m▲kes everyΘne else's luck m▲gic gΘ dΘwn</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some of these things specifically boost my Space powers though, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (seriously I'm starting to think the luck stat is phychologically based.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (Which would explain it breaking)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: psychologically*</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i dunno, maybe it's just the way you hung out with that frog</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: maybe influencing the frog influenced the contents</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so one of the frogs made it so Crows are constantly pecking at my eyes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: totally</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: .../great/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: maybe the frog just didn't like you</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But y'know I don't think I can listen to Charles in all good faith</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Since he never actually left the planet probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i have a brilliant plan to make you immune to crows</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I left the planet!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been to two others!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And both of the consort moons!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good for you!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I tried to kickstart the space mission and it still hasn't done much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've been to like sixty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean it helps I can teleport around like a majestic astral fairy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, SPACE RACE TIME</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I left you in my cosmic dust.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think we already lost the race ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not if we /speed up/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heck, we don't even have space pens yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Doubt that's even possible against a Space hero.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gotta speed up</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuu. Pencils.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ThΘse ▲re yΘur sp▲ce pens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: pencils?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Got a bone-hammer that shoots out little femurs that explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: the lead gets stuck in important equipment</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've never found a use for it, but it's hilarious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *graphite ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I've also been to the edge of the universe, which seems to be the error handling of attempting to flare back to a location back in the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: well okay thank you miss smarty pants</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course I don't go there anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not since I droped that... /thing/ off there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: cr▲yΘns?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Meanwhile, you guys have seriously never seen a boss?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I don't think so? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow, that's kind of impressive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They're a pretty crazy bunch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have 12 "minibosses" in my mountain. At least, I think that was part of the plot of my land quests.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 12 in a mountain</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...so that's what those snake consorts actually are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, they were actually experements.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember Dolos?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember hearing about that guy ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: vaguely remember him as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, lets just say there was enough consort in those hybrids to actually get past the door. Not very powerful, but they are quite intelegent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And they can shapeshift, which you all know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sounds incredibly lame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well I mean, sorta cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I suppose that makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They are like... mini denizens I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like the mini kraid in Super Metroid if you played it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: how's things on the ship, SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some of the ones out here are as tough or tougher than players</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright up here, same as usual ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like, players right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Some DBZ-tier fights compared to some mini-denizen consort things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I just like breaking Charles' balls it ain't a real pissing contest though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I've had to prevent them from making fusion reactors /twice/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but is there like, reasons to fight these bosses out there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah why don't you just tavros mode the bosses</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes it's to gain a new move or a weapon, but sometimes they want to destroy the world or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or they're doing some seriously bad things and it requires some mad player-power to stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The most recent one was toppling the Clockwork Regime by beating their boss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my plan to deal with a galactic empire is to throw Super Obama at them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then give him Obamanite so he Mega Evolves? <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I guess we could get the super emeralds in the mix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if we ever find that guy again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man that one was so rough I almost considered asking Rob for help.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Where is he anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: turn him into Hyper Obama.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he pops up every once in a while...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure at the moment ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But he's still alive, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a guy like RS doesn't die so easily. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS is with us</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what will you do then</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: then i'll beat the crap out of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously I can see a trick when its there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what trick</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: i just want to talk about life</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Isaac, you will be the crap out of me regardless of my choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: beat*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Honestly, you probably have it coming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: so what's the harm in letting me in if you know i'm gonna get in anyways</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I don't even know who this Isaac guy is</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: might as well appease me, hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: oh, just a drifter</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I can tell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually it didn't used to be so bad, there were some genuinely awesome people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then the game ended and everybody either left, died, or became Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hes a dude from another universe that has managed to turn up as a roleplay on Beta Earths Internet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: you wot mate</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Other universes?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So where does that put SJ and Kimura?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did the Sun orbit the planet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, it's in your usual solar system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It orbits, but it doesn't rotate, it just drifts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's apparently the curse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tell me when you find a planet that a star orbits on the opposing side of the moon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or if you find a flat planet.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though that's probably just my opinion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: eh, you can't rush art</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: even though i suppose we did</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Long time no see, how've you been?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Um. Fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Honing powers, sleeping in, the usual...stuff. You?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Doing quests, gathering loot, grinding mad skillz, the unusual</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well it's usual for me, but unusual in general.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Not really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Though then again you /are/ among this bunch, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: APPARENTLY, everybody's been lounging on the Starter Planet for like, ever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So it is rather unusual for a HARDCORE ADVENTURER to show up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I still need to remember to finish Festivale and watch ATLA... and resume arting, and set up the StuckIntoDespair minceraft server, and...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Uh... no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I went out for...a while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Then came back to starter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, that sounds like fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Anything cool going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: pie</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: being inflated</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I'm learning firebending.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: But those are both normal, so~</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Not really, though, I drift...in and out, it's hard for me to keep track of how /much/ time passes...sometimes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I'll start learning as soon as I stop procrastinating on figuring out an answer to PA's question :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Firebending?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((why do I always feel horrible when it seems that people have more fun off-screen and then they practically yell at those who choose to hang out on-screen...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: When did it become avatar?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Since someone /literally/ dropped in from that universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Woaaaah, cool!</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: my bad</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You've taken like a WEEK.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: because stuff keeps coming up &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Prioritize.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's not even a hard question!</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: what's the question</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Kim said he wanted to learn how to make infernos and bend fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Also I uh... found it in an hour but you disappered and I had stuff to do that day soooooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Actually what the hell was the question?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Fi do you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Was it like "What do you really want to learn?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: great. we both forgot :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...or maybe that was it</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yes, along with </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: "What do you think firebending is?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ... I was just typing that but okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: it's an art, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: In a way!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, it's an art.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, heads up then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...What.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Fi where's your house to the East or West?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: thaaat was the question I was having trouble with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: AREN'T YOU THE SPACE PLAYER?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That lake place, East or West of the ba-- fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I'm not /good/ with directions!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay in the East area past the lake Fi lives by there's a forest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait does the answer being posted in a public memo disqualify me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And WAAAY past that forest there's a mountain range with a lava plateu kinda thing near the center.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And there's a bunch of dragons who live neaaar there I think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Also because that's still not the answer</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: And-</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...PA where's your empyre again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: To the west.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Okay good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: But what you're tellin me is</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: There's dragons</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the map said it was a good ways southwest of Starter Town</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does the town have to have that name, seriously? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So to the Northeast of that there's a dragon. When I was learning to fight to beat Mike, I went to fist fight one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: We're completely unoriginal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You. Are an idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Ohmygod/why/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Starter town on starter planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ, it's as much a placeholder as the planet name itself is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Then again knowing you, fists are made of steel and all that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: BUT IT NEEDS A BETTER ONE ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because their scales are really good to harden your knucles on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also they can fly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and for the record, /responsibilities outside of this RP/ is why I haven't been able to watch ATLA... which at this point is purely an OOC need so I know what I'm doing ICly.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Next firebending lesson is at dragon ridge</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Wait no I need to teach the second one</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Okay THIRD one is at dragon ridge</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but assuming things don't explode tomorrow, I should be able to watch a few episodes of Book Three... also assuming youtube cooperates))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((why am I acting so frustrated right now?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Mm alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and thus I get further behind because of delays beyond my control...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: So Envy the fuck you at?</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((so what happened with the whole azure activation thing?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I'm not even being rational))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I dunno, Niki...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((missed most of it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm on this planet hunting down some lore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((CC: basically, FL got overwritten by his AI, who proceeded to go invincible, then decided it was boring, released FL, and went to troll our past selves))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so very anticlimactic))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((&gt;&gt;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'll try to get a real answer for the "what do I really want to learn" question tomorrow...</span><br />

<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: be careful about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#67009a">CAS: :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You should be worried about that Envy</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: especially if it's this planet ._.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah it's fine, nothing I can't handle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's not! It's a completely different one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you sure that's not the pie at Gene's calling you? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's supposedly cursed, the COOLEST THING, the planet doesn't rotate at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh thank god it's not this planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It drifts and orbits, but it doesn't spin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You are still way too attached to curses</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course I am!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I proved the existence of an afterlife earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It was pretty cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...You what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: /What/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, well actually I proved it a while ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait, do you mean it's tidally locked so the same side always faces the sun, like Old Earth and its moon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Turns out dead people fill up these places called deadworlds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or that it never spins /relative to actual space/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah pretty much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...Did you see Kat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It just never spins, one side always faces the sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: One side doesn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah, I didn't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I saw Merlynne and my mom but I didn't see Kat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Okay. That's. Okay. Your mom?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I thought she was alive what???</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay, tidally locked is kinda cool. the planet always having the same absolute orientation though would be even weirder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Or uh. Semi alive? </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Same absolute orientation pretty much actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Never spins relative to space, it's like frozen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The surface is frozen too, snow everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. whoa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Semi-alive too, I think. She's moving through deadworlds like nobody's business.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's how I got to them, chased her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh. That's relieving to hear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I think. Tell her I said hi.</span><br />
