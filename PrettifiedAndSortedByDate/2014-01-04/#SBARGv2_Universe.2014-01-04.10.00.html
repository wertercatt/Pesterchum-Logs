<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either that or run from zombies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically aim for the most spectacular death in the AU Machine, or Zombies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus I wanna do physics testing for the AU machine</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and gravity is a perfect test.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I stand by my previous statment that Zombies are so stupid one would have to be even stupider to be killed by them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Zombie /humans/ would be stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Zombie /dragons/ however...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... They would be more of a threat, yes. Even then... they would be a slow to move and think rotting corpse.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL was talking about the AU machine and zombies, and I said zombies are to threat, so....</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Uh huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: *are no threat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe use it for us to design dungeons for other players to /try/ to beat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Zombie xenomorphs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suggested Zombie Dragons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: For petes sake: Zombies, by definition, are rotting corpses. Sure, they may have some claws attached, and that may make them more dangerous... but still. Rotting. Corpse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If someone can die by rotting corpse, I would honestly just be dissapointed with them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Zombie Trubbish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: And what is more dangerous then a rotting xenomorph, who is probably leaking acid all over the place?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ZOMBIE MAGCARGO</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: mumified zombies</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see, 18,000F fluids leaking out...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: TT, Thats... well, I don't think zombies can become anymore zombie then the already are. So no putting zombie in your zombie so you can zombie when you can zombie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: zombified mummified zombies</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what about zombie headcrabs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like headcrabs that are zpmbies</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: /At best,/ they would be just as deadly as a normal headcrab. </span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Zombie Bec Noir.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Because, for normal zombies, what sort of advantage would anything honestly get? -and no I am not counting those "super-zambies" that you see in like left for dea and stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: * left for dead and stuff. I cannot type today.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Zombie Nanomachines.</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: You havent been in the bar</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless I had a food replicator hooked up to a spare node.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, I have 50 of those golden power nodes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Can't exactly replicate them though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (it won't replicate them to a small enough level)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I suppose I could try to replicate it on the macro scale...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just know that the Golden Power Node isn't going to be made on a large scale any time soon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll just say that its similar to the logic of SCP-2559-J, except with energy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This plane, might in fact be the location where SBURB draws the power for houses.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, the energy required to create a link is astounding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: my brain hurτs jusτ lisτening τo τhis</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ....depends, whaτ is iτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It takes place in a possible doomed timeline for the session where Ornis was unable to fix the glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...τhaτ does noτ sound preττy</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: The Tea party was... yeah, it sucked ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On the bright side, Chronos had been defeated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: And FL, if any dungeon you make involves SCP's I am slighty gonna murder your ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you just covering up for the fact that you screwed up a couple of the variables? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On the bad side, the "AU" Session is filled with so many glitches that the Blue hole has eaten out of a large section of the magicant</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, don't worry, normal physics are still a thing. You will still have gravity, for example.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because when ever I've been sleeping... I've tended to wake up with that plush you gave to me in a different spot. Then again it could be one of the Nags playing a prank on me.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Ars Magica and Thaumcraft are the main magic mods, which involve a large degree of research.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: All of Chickenbones mods make it alot easier to run things away from the base (might add portal gun, but nether portals might be enough)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tinkers Construct allows for making awesome tools, while Factorization and Applied Energistics allows for massive amounts of storage and... MISC stuff.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think DS said the test-run target planet was ~5LY away, so that's a good search radius...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: SL's ship, though? Isn't that still around?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, but it doesn't have a warp drive</span><br />

<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Nakdrive</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: we will fly with the power of Nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Bleh. So, we either just sit around, somehow aquire a warp/nak drive, or go out into space and have it take a TON of time to find DS.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I guess the warp drive might have... cut out between those two stars?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what are you trying to translate anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that distress signal from a zillion miles away I think. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: miles, that is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might as well be a zillion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, If we could gather up enough uranium, we could get there with a degree of time dilation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it would likely be one way assuming we didn't save any fuel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ im pretty sure, the words, "uranium, anti-matter, bomb," and "angel" are despised upon the community</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More like /propel/ with nukes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all we could build it in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or carry it into space.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ for me to calculate</span><br />
<span style="color:#0dc7ca">CPE: ~ but its a big number</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, too long to be worth it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: PE, lemme put it this way. try to imagine going from one end of a MC world to another, with only creative mode flight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, we wouldn't have to worry about time dialation if we had you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3 years.</span><br />
