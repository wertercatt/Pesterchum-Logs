[08:54:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  eventually, they all board, some of the spider dieciding to just climb up the sides instead and enter that way. --</span><br />
[08:55:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *internal intercom* also guys, make room in there. between the Fahr Pizzaria Semi and the Big Bomb Cannon, a lot of room is already occupied...</span><br />
