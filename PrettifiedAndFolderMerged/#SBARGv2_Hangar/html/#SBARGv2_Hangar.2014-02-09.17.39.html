<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...There is no way in hell the lunar whale is gonna fit in that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have no idea. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks up the /highly visible ramp./ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((is that a firefly-class vessel?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Yes. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yup))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((very nice))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...yeah, i think we can get my tv setup in the cargo bay there</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't like it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: or in a shuttle or quarters i guess, if you dont want a snes as soon as you walk in</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...fuck off charles, firefly-class vessels are awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its... overly cramped.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: expecially in the rooms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well if ya want more space theres the 2 shuttles</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus it looks like we are gonna have to share rooms if we get more than nine people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: didn't Fluffy say this one would have more room than usual or something ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I could have sworn I remember hearing that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, this blueprint is just the base model and she expanded it for us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still don't have a decent amount of rooms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe we should have planned a ship in minecraft or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...worst case scenario we could cannibalize the warp drive from this thing and put it in the Whale</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: be nice to have a firefly though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, hold on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so... does anyone even know how to pilot one of these things? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shakes his head --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...good point</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is looking for a clear spot in the cargo bay. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see, which card... aha!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Niki, could you move... a foor to the left?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( foot* ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, sure. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...charles what the fuck are you doing</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  walks a short distance to the left, about 5 feet to be sure --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  deploys the small ship that was used to get to Earth 2. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  //I forgot what it looked like --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we need to, we can syphon the exotic matter we need from it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is just sorta standing around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...so any reason to be here or</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we know the lunar whale isn't going to fit in here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i can move my tv setup in there</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...gonna miss the old whale but</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I could link the FTL drive in my ship to the one here to boost our speed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: would it be possible to have FL captcha the Whale, and uncaptcha it when we need it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ill captcha it</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont trust him with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably a good idea. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk. just suggested FL since I know Filesystem Modus has very generous space limits, but if Convoy can handle it, go ahead</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill get everything moved over to the firefly first though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: only because Filesystem bumps up the ram as you add more cards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then I ended up hitting the max number of cards filesystem supports which is a few billion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think its four billion and something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: still</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ill take it for my own use</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Got it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...how did you load that many captchacards in your  modus in the first place??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ill be keeping my setup in the whale until i get some kind of confirmation that we are going with the firefly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: chronic kleptomania, I think it was</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I ended up spamming creation of captchablocks (sets of 64 cards) in order to captcha Ashsprites' present so I could hide it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then I did it again to store the battleships.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ended up using a ton of artifact grist in the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...well unless theres something else to discuss im heading home</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (I am so glad captchacards can be made from /any/ type of grist.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, could I erm... hang out with Cody some time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...why do you want to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I made my mistake of fearing Amy early on then regretting it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't wanna make that mistake again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  smiles a little --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...sure thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just dont fuck with him, alright? i dont want him coming home with an antimatter gun or some shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, my knowledge of science is shoving things together to make them work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: still</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...but yeah, you can hang out with him</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I was smart at anything, it was using the alchemy system we can no longer access.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well all be sharing a ship anyway, most likely</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I could have the AU Machine load the code for our session so I could learn more recipes... but it wouldn't help for most of the items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since most of the items have magic and shit preventing them from being replicated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and I'm rambling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...if you want to hang out with him, probably best to wait till were on the ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just because its less of a headache for everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...plus hes still a bit too little to really hang with, you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe we should see him play qwop</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: when he grows up at least</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...why</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i mean like</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why that specific thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its not fun to go into a random AU where it forces you into a non bipedial form, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((brb))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...not gonna ask</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least it was fourth gen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, night SL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sure thing</span><br />
