<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT fLmun [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I've begun doing research into quantum field manipulation... which most of you would call "Magic"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But, I found something rather suprising.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Period 11 Elements tend to have quite a large amount of "magical" potential.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Copper, Silver, Gold, Roentgenium...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#1f1184">CURRENT sherlockAdventurest [CSA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: zillieum</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not talking about types of grist...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Has anyone noticed that their more powerful gear tends to be made of period 11 elements?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, normally, a golden sword wouldn't be that good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: My pen's tip is made of copper</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I made another one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, after a large ammount of alchemy, I have discovered... that Golden Weapons are quite High Tier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so basically, the opposite of Minecraft Logic, unless actually alchemizing things from MC itself</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, not exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know how in minecraft gold items tend to get the most powerful enchantments?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its similar to what is going on here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Magic", is causing these Period 11 items to become quite powerful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so, basically the same idea, but since Sbarg doesn't have Item Durability as a thing afaik, you get the benefits without the downsides</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, I've managed to break a sword before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Item Durability still exists, it just doesn't work the same way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TLDR I've made the Golden Sword from a link to the past.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it is amazing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I triple alchemized using my time artifact, my pen, and copper statue</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I haven't really done much work into studying magical effects on other atomic elements.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need to see about making a stable isotope of Roentgenium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: roentwhat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Atomic element 111</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if my calculations are right... I should be able to triple this things power if I manage to alchemize it with a stable isotope of roentgenium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If not... well, I can triple it for about 26 seconds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: whats your kind abstratus</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Swordkind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: what is your current sword and how did you alchemize it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Golden Sword... lets see... I did alot of upgrades... I'll try to remember...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: Okay, so what if I let you alchemize MY godpen with your sword...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I managed to turn my plastic sword into a metal one...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think we have enough grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda drained my coffers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: Can we buy more grist with boon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: because we're stilling racking up boonbucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sure, if one of you ever tells me where the DAMN STOCK EXCHANGE IS!</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: we're using sburbuy</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: and Chameleons keep buying pillows.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I think I could send you some of our bonds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Oh If only he knew... it was under his feet the entire time. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't worry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's always the gristgrinder</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Geckos buy honey from me like crazy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: So we set up an alchemiter that automatically makes pillows</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((your land has the LOSACSE, FL?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: they then enter a safe </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Bigger on the inside then the outside, y'know how those things work</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, we could increase our gold grist... but do you guys want to deal with the underling attacks?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: and from there, the pillows are dispatched on sburbuy to our loyal buyers</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Yes. He doesn't know it though... THE IRONY. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: who are willing to pay boonBONDS for pillows</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: we're pirating grist from everyone in the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't like robbing the little guys blind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: so we have a near infinite supply of grist</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: and can alchemize endless pillows</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats why I set the price of the honey kinda low.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But anyway...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: so we basically have infinite boonbonds</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I could get us huge quantitys of gold grist, but... the byproduct kinda attracts underlings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: thats fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: byproduct of what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And is painful to look at.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: we'll just kill them with the god weapon</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: God weapon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not THAT powerful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: when you mix a weapon with a god weapon the result is usually pretty good</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/swordscopy.png'>http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/swordscopy.png</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That shows the power of the golden sword in comparison.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: sso its already pretty powerful</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Psycho Burgundy's the strongest board I got...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if I could make the stable Roentgenium...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ....Or it was, at least...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I could triple that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I have an idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: LoBaC has a lot of scientist</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have this really really powerful prostheticleg called the esperanza slasher leg, but it tends to leave a lot of colateral damage when used and it's pretty expensive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I don't think the Celestial Katana can actually be alchemy-upgraded, though individual brush techniques can be leveled up for boonbucks (which we just got a legendary infinite pile of)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Or I could just captcharoid a completed model.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've pretty much sworn off using it for anything but really tough bosses</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Psycho Burgundy burned up my soul as fuel for hella powerful flames...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: there's probably still potential in my ninjaKind weapon set, though I haven't actually used that specibus since about a week after entry</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: LOBAC scientists produce crazy alchemy upgrades</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: When I went back I kind of killed an entire lab and took upgrades</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOU WHAT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: Yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: S_A</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seriously?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: So my pen is pretty fucking OP</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: S____A</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I didn't kill them</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I locked them in a closet</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You just said you killed them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What is it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: those guys are so easy to over power</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: oh I did? ooops...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I meant over took</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: so their all fine now</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: but I stole the upgrades</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Good going.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You just took an alignment penalty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: so we have a lot of stuff we can alchemize to upgrade weapons</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: they don't neccasarilly make them more powerful</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: just more potent</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I've still got a bunch of seals that serve the same purpose</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And that Tarot Deck: Magister's Might edition from that one dungeon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: hmmm we could make the ultimate weapons if we could alchemize </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Still gotta distribute that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Can I strap him into some long fall boots and toss him off the roof of my house?</span><br />

<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: they build houses out of the pillows</span><br />

<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: 1000 should be easy to keep up with</span><br />

<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: who's the one selling honey?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...we have a dojo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: how much do you have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if I remember corretly, captchacards are pretty cheap</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL, I think gristwidgeting "any grist type" items defaults to Build</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, if anybody needs me I'll be teaching mechanics and inventing classes to consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: charge them a fuck ton</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so it'd be 1 Build per recycled card, minus a few booncents for each use</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: we're racking up boons</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: 1000</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Instead of making CRAZY prices and only a few consorts can buy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: I don't make the prices</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: they bid for it and its always really high</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm no tech but I AM a wonderful doctor</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: because they understand how much these pillows are REALLY worth</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If you don't mind quotations around "doctor"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yet, how many can one sell on that site at a time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: They can't propogate at the rate they are if they don't have pillows</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: We have it set up at a cap that I can't remembert</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I did invest in a Bag of Holding+20 earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: and the endless safe holds an endless amount of pillows</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: so every time one disappears another one appears</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I think Sburbuy has a limit on the number of simultanious items you can list, based on account age and number of sales</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: yah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, uh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: the latter meaning it'll let you sell more of them faster as you keep this up</span><br />

<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: and suddenly the buying frequency went up</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :o?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: they are DEFINETELY propagating</span><br />
<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: that means more customers</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: 10... 100... 1000...</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: shit, I just realized. if your consorts are reproducing as fast as the pillows, that will theoretically lead to your land becoming a pile of infinite consort.</span><br />

<span style="color:#1f1184">CSA: but our loyal customers spend entire boonbonds</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Always.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: jokerKind, from one interpretation i saw, is anything with comidic value can be used with it</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Guess that could work too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think its fair to remember you don't need a specibus card to use that kind of weapon it just makes really good storage for them</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I find it similar to that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually, between HS and Replay Value, I was under the assumption that Sburb Logic actually prevents you from strifing with something you don't have an abstractus for, with the exception of Sylladex Weaponization</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: That is all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: but since we're more self-aware than normal players because of all the broken code, Sburb Logic doesn't nerf our ability to just beat imps over the head with things</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the way I see it, no particular kind is really "the best", you just need to be creative and have fun with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Do you think, for example, that I know how to use a shotgun? Well, other than point and shoot...</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Excuse me, drillKind can pierce the heavens</span><br />
