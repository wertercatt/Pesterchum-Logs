[05:04:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I was /sick/ of Dark types kicking my ass.</span><br />
[05:05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only way you would take 4x damage from Psychic is if you were a Fighting/Poison type.</span><br />

[07:48:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Amy, what?</span><br />
[07:48:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:48:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I am purrfectly aware. And… oh goddamnit what'd she do now and… why are you talking to her Denizen? O.o</span><br />
[07:48:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: are you fucking kidding me</span><br />
[07:48:29] <span style="color:#be00be">CAS: Something a8out caves under the Forge, I think?</span><br />
[07:49:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:49:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, that sounds reasonably specific enough to start searching for her...</span><br />
[07:49:58] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((oh god i have like 50 things happening at once))</span><br />
[07:50:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((wat.))</span><br />
[07:52:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:52:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I feel guilty.</span><br />
[07:52:15] <span style="color:#be00be">CAS: How come?</span><br />
[07:52:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: for what, FL?</span><br />
[07:52:19] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: good</span><br />
[07:52:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The fact that I'm tired as hell and I'm even /comtemplating/ just leaving it to you guys.</span><br />
[07:52:53] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what ash</span><br />
[07:52:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[07:53:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … dude, FL, that's not a bad thing.</span><br />
[07:53:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If you're tired, you probs wouldn't be super-effective.</span><br />
[07:53:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We can /probably/ handle it.</span><br />
[07:53:25] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont need to do everything</span><br />
[07:53:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit, I know thats a logical excuse...</span><br />
[07:53:35] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: particularly since theres a good chance youll end up nuking it</span><br />
[07:53:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:53:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL, not helping.</span><br />
[07:53:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: S_L</span><br />
[07:53:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, that is a horrible idea.</span><br />
[07:54:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And FL, not everything is your fault, don't you fucking dare start angsting about it or w/e.</span><br />
[07:54:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: am i wrong</span><br />
[07:54:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'm shocked Ornis hasn't deleted the antimatter code.</span><br />
[07:55:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...to be honest, I'm surprised about that too...</span><br />
[07:55:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway Amy, when should we come over?</span><br />
[07:55:29] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How did you get the code for antimatter in the first place?</span><br />
[07:55:33] <span style="color:#be00be">CAS: May8e?</span><br />
[07:55:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS, I came across it when I was trying to make a Warp Engine.</span><br />
[07:55:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: from star trek.</span><br />
[07:56:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still no luck on finding the code for dilithium crystals.</span><br />
[07:56:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that, and apparently the code for Cream Pies (Bovine Milk (Creamed) &amp;&amp; Pie Tin) is apparently the same code as (Matter &amp;&amp; Antimatter) or something...</span><br />
[08:01:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Make sure she gets back safe.</span><br />
[08:01:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you understand me?</span><br />
[08:01:32] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: who ash</span><br />
[08:01:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes SL.</span><br />
[08:01:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ash.</span><br />
[08:01:55] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
[08:01:57] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sigh.</span><br />
[08:02:13] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: funny, id be more worried about that if you were coming</span><br />
[08:02:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, I swear to god if she permadies, I am going to kill you.</span><br />
[08:03:05] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why me</span><br />
[08:03:11] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im not gonna fuckin kill ash</span><br />
[08:03:39] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Man the passive-aggressive is strong in this one</span><br />
[08:03:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pff</span><br />
[08:03:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because you are the player of life, and thus its within your power to revive her if it comes to that.</span><br />
[08:03:57] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...fair enough</span><br />
[08:04:07] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so as long as she doesnt get killed twice, were good</span><br />
[08:04:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, we going to LoFaT or what?</span><br />
[08:04:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:04:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And now I have to deal with a salt flood.</span><br />
[08:04:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /SAM I SWEAR TO GO-</span><br />
[08:04:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has disconnected from memo. --</span><br />
