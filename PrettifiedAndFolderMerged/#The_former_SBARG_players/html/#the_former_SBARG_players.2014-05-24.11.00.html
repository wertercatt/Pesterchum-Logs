[14:00:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: ...wait, holy shit it's FLord.</span><br />
[14:00:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: guessing this is the version of you from before you came to our session...</span><br />
[14:01:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...No, I'm pretty sure I remember the post scratch session... and I think I /did/ die... just can't remember... how.</span><br />
[14:01:41] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Holy fuck why do dreambubbles have snow storms</span><br />
[14:01:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: ...oh.</span><br />
[14:01:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: wait wat</span><br />
[14:02:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: ok, for the second question: do you ever remember setting foot on LoSaCrystal, my land?</span><br />
[14:02:45] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Not really...</span><br />
[14:03:04] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Seriously this place is whack.</span><br />
[14:03:20] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: There is giant orbs of snow in the SKY.</span><br />
[14:03:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: what about another snow land? I know mine wasn't the only Land of Snow and X in the session... and statistically speaking, Pre-Scratch had to have had a few as well.</span><br />
[14:03:39] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CBI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[14:03:50] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: It might be a fusion of areas for all I know.</span><br />
[14:04:15] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I remember a land that had beaches with floating balls of water in the sky...</span><br />
[14:04:38] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...and its almost this is it, except frozen over.</span><br />
[14:05:05] <span style="color:#646464">-- ??? creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[?CP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[14:05:15] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Still can't find a blasted alchemiter in this place.</span><br />
[14:05:46] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I found a rusty computer, which I'm using... and it says its the year 2024.</span><br />
[14:06:53] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Which considering further ring logic, might be right.</span><br />
[14:08:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: but um...</span><br />
[14:08:11] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: /WEATHER/.</span><br />
[14:08:29] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (seriously why do ghosts get frostbite.)</span><br />
[14:09:10] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...WHY ARE THERE SKELETAL IMPS IN A DREAM BUBBLE?!</span><br />
[14:09:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: well, everything in a bubble comes from the memories of the occupants...</span><br />
[14:10:36] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: The only thing I remember skeletal imps from is reading homestuck. Never saw them in person, until now.</span><br />
[14:11:08] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...which means this planet might actually be real... just trapped in a bubble and incredibly old.</span><br />
[14:11:18] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Lets see if I can kill the dead.</span><br />
[14:11:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Or in this case, the Undead.</span><br />
[14:13:50] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...how the hell can these things have so much health?</span><br />
[14:13:56] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: GOT YA YOU BOZO</span><br />
[14:15:01] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Alright, I have learned three things.</span><br />
[14:15:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: 1: You can kill them</span><br />
[14:15:28] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: 2: With remembering top tier gear, it still takes a fucking long time.</span><br />
[14:15:36] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: 3: They drop minimal grist.</span><br />
[14:15:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: sounds like someone in your bubble is from a Void Session then...</span><br />
[14:17:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Alright, found another imp.</span><br />
[14:17:11] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Gonna do an experiment.</span><br />
[14:17:20] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: and throw it out of the bubble.</span><br />
[14:17:26] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And see what happens.</span><br />
[14:19:20] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Well thats some grist that isn't coming back.</span><br />
[14:19:55] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...So, real imps here.</span><br />
[14:20:43] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Now I question what could happen to allow for a land to get so far outside of its session to manage to get into a bubble.</span><br />
[14:22:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...gog dammit where is a god damn alchemiter.</span><br />
[14:22:42] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...wait, I can just... imagine one.</span><br />
[14:22:44] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: :|</span><br />
[14:22:55] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: or in this case, remember.</span><br />
[14:24:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...so, what do I hate??</span><br />
[14:26:35] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I can't hate dream bubbles, since I would cease to exist without it, I can't hate time travel, since... not really the best example...</span><br />
[14:26:40] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...hmm...</span><br />
[14:27:26] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Alright, I found a quest bed...</span><br />
[14:32:54] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...kinda reminds me of digimon.</span><br />
[14:34:52] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Yeah I have no idea what this aspect is supposed to be.</span><br />
[14:36:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[14:36:43] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 man im bad :3</span><br />
[14:37:30] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 i alchmeyed an imp training dummy and my fighting is terrible :3</span><br />
[14:37:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 /too rusty/ :3</span><br />
[14:47:30] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ((im reading all my logs))</span><br />
[14:48:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( because there are a lot of them on this computer))</span><br />
[14:56:32] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Um... It looks like the crest of friendship from digimon, except the center circle is filled in.</span><br />
[14:56:54] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 Intresting :3</span><br />
[14:57:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 another undocumented exlusive aspect apparently :3</span><br />
[14:57:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 specific versions of s(whatever) can have specific undocumented aspects :3</span><br />
[14:57:56] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Right.</span><br />
[14:58:31] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: The aspect itself is a... cyan, while the bed around it is an orange red.</span><br />
[14:59:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( when did pk get so smart about S(whatever) games? idk, but sometimes charecters go in directions you dont expect))</span><br />
[14:59:21] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 well try laying on the bed? :3</span><br />
[14:59:48] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 maybe something'll happen :3</span><br />
[15:00:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...yeah I'm not gonna try is</span><br />
[15:00:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: it*</span><br />
[15:01:04] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: We already know that dual tiers are insane, we don't need to do it with blood and what ever this... flowy aspect is.</span><br />
[15:01:04] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 can you take a picture of it? :3</span><br />
[15:01:24] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( is it supposed to be flow from glitchfaq? ))</span><br />
[15:02:01] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Hold on.</span><br />
[15:03:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL:  <a href='http://i.imgur.com/wBL9Pdp.png'>http://i.imgur.com/wBL9Pdp.png</a></span><br />
[15:03:39] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 huh :3</span><br />
[15:04:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Like I said, it reminded me of the crest of friendship from digimon.</span><br />
[15:04:35] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 friendship the aspect? :3</span><br />
[15:04:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 maybe? :3</span><br />
[15:05:08] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 look around and see if you can find the land's owner i guess? :3</span><br />
[15:05:22] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: This place seems deserted.</span><br />
[15:05:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 deadland? :3</span><br />
[15:06:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Hell frozen over.</span><br />
[15:07:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 so the land's dead hmmm :3</span><br />
[15:09:12] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: really getting mixed tones here</span><br />
[15:22:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( how is google captions so good at AVGN? ))</span><br />
[15:29:06] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 dont really know what to say expect guess we know where to go if we run low on grist :3</span><br />
[15:29:21] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 go wherever you are and grind on skeleton imps :3</span><br />
[15:38:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( man v2pk never got better at insults did she? ))</span><br />
[15:38:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 am i the only one here :3</span><br />
[15:38:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 that's still carin :3</span><br />
[15:38:42] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 g :3</span><br />
[15:41:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: nah, just multitasking.</span><br />
[15:41:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: ((so far behind on coding it ain't funny anymore))</span><br />
[15:42:08] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( well im currently just raging at past me for using the wrong chumdroid ))</span><br />
[15:42:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( the one that doesnt save logs))</span><br />
[15:42:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( so many things i did i dont have logs for and forgotten about ))</span><br />
[15:47:57] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( ugh i hate when you have that one roleplayer you really enjoy roleplaying with))</span><br />
[15:48:11] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: (( and then suddenly you cant find them anywhere anymore))</span><br />
[16:04:13] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Alright, I've managed to dream up a holopad so I have plenty of time to experiment with Alchemy.</span><br />
[16:04:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 alright :3</span><br />
[16:04:44] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Do you have a holopad on your meteor to compare with?</span><br />
[16:05:18] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I want to know what happens when I try new alchemy. If it matches the actual result, or is an imagined result.</span><br />
[16:05:20] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 yeah it's in the "misc attachments" section of my portable alchemy kit :3</span><br />
[16:05:48] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 alright it's hooked up :3</span><br />
[16:06:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Alright, first off...</span><br />
[16:06:28] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Yep, Captcha Cards still have a code of 11111111 here.</span><br />
[16:06:40] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 yep :3</span><br />
[16:06:46] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...And I'm gonna chuck one outside the bubble, one sec.</span><br />
[16:06:54] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...It still exists out there.</span><br />
[16:07:15] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 see if you cant alchemy a robobody :3</span><br />
[16:07:27] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I guess since the Imps were real, I was able to get real grist, and thus real alchemy.</span><br />
[16:08:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...I'm gonna Alchemize an alchemiter, since this one keeps fading in and out of existance.</span><br />
[16:10:33] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: All capital O's make nothing, and all 0's make a Perfectly Generic Object.</span><br />
[16:11:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Actually, considering the O code spend grist, it might have made something.</span><br />
[16:11:12] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Perhaps a gas?</span><br />
[16:11:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 probally air :3</span><br />
[16:11:41] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Or should we say, Oxygen.</span><br />
[16:11:55] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...since Its the 8th element, and is symbolized by an O.</span><br />
[16:11:59] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: so OOOOOOOO</span><br />
[16:12:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 that makes since :3</span><br />
[16:12:19] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 *sense :3</span><br />
[16:12:58] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: What do you think, Red texted one who I'm remembering should have green text.</span><br />
[16:13:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 who me? :3</span><br />
[16:13:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 your the one with red text :3</span><br />
[16:13:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 im green :3</span><br />
[16:14:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'm talking about the one with Red text, not Maroon.</span><br />
[16:14:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 kimura? :3</span><br />
[16:14:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL:  <span style="color:#ff0000"> Red, </span> <span style="color:#800000"> Maroon</span></span><br />
[16:14:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: hm?</span><br />
[16:14:38] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 oh, he's from the postreset :3</span><br />
[16:15:01] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Yeah... I just... remember a different text color.</span><br />
[16:15:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: yeah, I was <span style="color:#005500">this color</span> before I self-prototyped...</span><br />
[16:16:36] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Alright, let me try to... catch up on my memories.</span><br />
[16:16:47] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I figure I must have done something horrible to die.</span><br />
[16:19:59] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Was it karma for wrecking his questbed?</span><br />
[16:21:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: actually... you died Heroically, saving him from being vaporized by his denizen.</span><br />
[16:21:24] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Well. That sucks.</span><br />
[16:21:45] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I expected to live long enough to take Chronos on for... I guess round one.</span><br />
[16:22:29] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Should I be hiding?</span><br />
[16:23:08] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...He kicked your ass, didn't he.</span><br />
[16:23:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 according to kimura, they auctually kicked his ass :3</span><br />
[16:23:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: no, we kicked /his/.</span><br />
[16:23:49] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 NINJA'd :3</span><br />
[16:24:38] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...So, did you finish him off, or did he escape?</span><br />
[16:25:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: we turned him into goo and he /died for good/.</span><br />
[16:27:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Alright then.</span><br />
[16:27:17] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: What about that one player killing son of a bitch?</span><br />
[16:28:01] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CME</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[16:28:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: he quit Bakagami and rejoined our side, and helped us win the game.</span><br />
[16:28:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: not to mention helped close the <span style="color:#004dbc">Blue Hole</span></span><br />
[16:29:16] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...okay...</span><br />
[16:29:43] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Are you /sure/ Chronos is gone?</span><br />
[16:30:53] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Cause if hes dead, he might still be in the bubbles.</span><br />
[16:31:19] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Then again, he can't really kill anyone in them without killing himself in the pop... so... :/</span><br />
[16:31:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: ...actually, our session didn't even /have/ dreambubbles apparently. I'm not sure how you got into one after dying Heroically, but I doubt he got into one.</span><br />
[16:32:00] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Yeah I'd like to make sure the Chronos is double dead, to be frank.</span><br />
[16:32:35] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Maybe I'm in the bubbles due to my connection to the first session?</span><br />
[16:32:52] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: It would make sense... then again, Chronos was in three sessions...</span><br />
[16:33:09] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...So that changes the odds.</span><br />
[16:33:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...I'm going paranoid on me.</span><br />
[16:35:05] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Thankfully, there should only be one life ring in all of paradox space, so we won't worry about that.</span><br />
[16:35:56] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: course if they start getting spread around like cheap candy, thats something to worry about.</span><br />
[16:38:47] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Then again, there is also the bubblewrap concept... which still makes dreambubbles safe from him.</span><br />
[16:43:37] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Bubblewrap: The theoretical concept of creating an artifical mobile dream bubble around a ghost to allow for travel outside of the bubbles.</span><br />
[16:43:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">?CP: ........</span><br />
[16:45:00] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: However, such a configuration would be highly unstable, and may cause cessation of existance if it fails.</span><br />
[16:45:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 i still think you should just make a robotic body to haunt :3</span><br />
[16:45:35] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :3 channel your inner ariada :3</span><br />
[16:45:37] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: No idea how one would make it though.</span><br />
[16:45:46] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: A soulbot would be far more stable.</span><br />
[16:46:43] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Then again, I would guess that a space player would be able to rip part of a bubble off.</span><br />
[16:46:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: So for spacers, it would be far easier than learning how to build a soulbot.</span><br />
[16:47:46] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Course I have no idea how to make either, which brings us to the current point.</span><br />
[16:48:17] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I'm currently immobile, except for the points where bubbles brush up against each other.</span><br />
[16:48:27] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CUT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[16:49:33] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I suppose if we did enough research, we could place a bubblewrap generator on that meteor of yours.</span><br />
[16:50:28] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And the current stance of me being in this memo is likely linking our relative time.</span><br />
[16:51:45] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: So if we are off temporally, We would have no way to meet up in person at this time.</span><br />
