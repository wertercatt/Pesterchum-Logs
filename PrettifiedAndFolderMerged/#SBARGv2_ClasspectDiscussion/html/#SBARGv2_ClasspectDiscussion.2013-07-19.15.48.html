[03:48:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 CLASSPECTDISCUSSION.</span><br />
[03:49:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[03:50:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:50:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so.....</span><br />
[03:51:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is this where topics go to die</span><br />
[03:51:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you all seen this image?</span><br />
[03:52:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121224004810/mspaintadventures/images/a/a6/Aspect_Pairings.png'>http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121224004810/mspaintadventures/images/a/a6/Aspect_Pairings.png</a></span><br />
[03:52:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[03:52:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, that'd be the Pointy Haired Boss' nonexistent brain.</span><br />
[03:52:33] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I've seen that pic</span><br />
[03:52:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, it looks familiar</span><br />
[03:54:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it has been mentioned that There are Active and Passive versions of each class.</span><br />
[03:54:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, only three pairs are confirmed.</span><br />
[03:54:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lord - Muse</span><br />
[03:54:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thief - Rogue</span><br />
[03:54:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Prince - Bard</span><br />
[03:55:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, there has been speculation, and hints.</span><br />
[03:55:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the comic, it was mentioned that the Heiress is the Maid, refering to Jane.</span><br />
[03:55:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But what if that is another pair?</span><br />
[03:56:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heir being active, and Maid being Passive?</span><br />
[03:57:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, thats another pair.</span><br />
[03:57:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But, Maid might also pair with Sylph.</span><br />
[03:57:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As healers.</span><br />
[03:58:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If so, that might pair Mage with Heir.</span><br />
[03:58:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As an Heir becomes his aspect, a mage might instead be consumed by it.</span><br />
[03:59:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that might actuallly make some sort of sense</span><br />
[03:59:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or, perhaps instead of Consumed, surrounded by it.</span><br />
[03:59:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Voices of the Doomed, remember?</span><br />
[04:00:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh yeah, that was always Sollux's thing...</span><br />
[04:00:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right.</span><br />
[04:02:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either he is surrounded by the voices, or... perhaps he is being consumed by doom, dying... twice? no, three times, due to prospit.</span><br />
[04:02:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But that third time he was half dead.</span><br />
[04:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know.</span><br />
[04:03:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But lets look at Meulin.</span><br />
[04:04:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Her hearing might have been consumed by heart, or it might be her surrounding herself with heart that caused that.</span><br />
[04:05:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But her hearing might have also been destroyed by rage, if you look at it that way.</span><br />
[04:05:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we don't know much about Mages.</span><br />
[04:07:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Page is untapped potential.</span><br />
[04:08:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So perhaps it might be a counterpart to a Knight.</span><br />
[04:08:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, I would say that is likely.</span><br />
[04:09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As a Knight exploited their aspect, perhaps a Page learns the true potential of his aspect?</span><br />
[04:10:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But, question is...</span><br />
[04:10:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which one in that pair is active?</span><br />
[04:10:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Karkat was a Knight of Blood.</span><br />
[04:11:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He used his aspect to get the others to work together.</span><br />
[04:11:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seems like Knights are active, since Dave exploited Time /for himself/...</span><br />
[04:11:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then again, idk</span><br />
[04:11:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, think about it.</span><br />
[04:11:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He pulled off all of those Time Loops for TEREZI.</span><br />
[04:12:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, its a Knights job assist the space player in creation of the genesis frog.</span><br />
[04:12:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ohhhhhhhh, that's right...</span><br />
[04:12:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, it seems to me that a Knight may be Passive.</span><br />
[04:13:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yet, we still haven't touched on Seers yet.</span><br />
[04:14:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A seer speaks with knowledge that comes from his/her aspect, like I have stated.</span><br />
[04:15:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That might be a passive Sylph, not just from the speaking part, but a Sylph may litterally bring his/her aspect.</span><br />
[04:16:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I feel that might be enough to pair Sylph with Seer.</span><br />
[04:16:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So...</span><br />
[04:16:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lord - Muse</span><br />
[04:16:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thief - Rogue</span><br />
[04:16:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Prince - Bard</span><br />
[04:17:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heir - Maid</span><br />
[04:17:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Page - Knight</span><br />
[04:17:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Witch - Mage</span><br />
[04:17:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sylph - Seer</span><br />
[04:17:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats it.</span><br />
[04:18:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Any comments?</span><br />
[04:18:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Before I wrap this up in a paste bin and link it to the main memo?</span><br />
[04:18:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm so not an expert on classes @ _@</span><br />
[04:19:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *shrug and a half*</span><br />
[04:19:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, should I pastebin now?</span><br />
[04:20:15] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sure, I guess</span><br />
