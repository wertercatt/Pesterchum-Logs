<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  SJ is greeted with the sound of near by construction. Huge pylons and a dozen robots were working on an empty lot at  the end of Fluffy's makeshift runway --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  is sitting on a lawnchair in a lab outfit with a rather pensive face. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  takes off her goggles and lies down --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  stands on the dirt makeshift road of her landing strip ( <a href='http://i.imgur.com/MAlOrhF.jpg'>http://i.imgur.com/MAlOrhF.jpg</a> ), her space ship also parked on it (<a href='http://i.imgur.com/l5TpWYN.jpg'>http://i.imgur.com/l5TpWYN.jpg</a> ). Down the way a bit, a large structure is being built by robots. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  scans the sky with her six eyes and wonders where this mystery visitor is. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  simply appears next to the being he doesn't recognise, pulling out of a midair front flip as he does so. He's hovering in a crouch next to her, what looks to be a cross between a human male and the Cheshire Cat. Ginger-furred cat ears, short red hair, a vaguely fur-like stripy pattern visible wherever skin is exposed (though his skin is incredibly pale despite it all), a tail lashing behind him, wide green --</span><br />
eyes, and a Thief of Void's outfit with a golden circlet to complete it all.<br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well hel-lo there, Fluffles! I'm assuming that's you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  looked down at AG. Fluffy herself stood 6 feet tall and was currently not wearing a god dang thing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Well hello there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is about 5'7", though it'd be hard to tell with the way he's crouched on all fours at about chest height in midair. "Just said that. So you're a newniverse inhabitant! Fascinating to meet you. As you can see, I really am a cat." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  exits bar --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I can see that. But you look more like how the Kimura puppy appears.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Well, when he's not like this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  gets down on all fours, turning into a quadraped version of herself ( <a href='http://i.imgur.com/OnQAxZt.png'>http://i.imgur.com/OnQAxZt.png</a> ) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  circles around AG curiously. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I am not the only inhabitant of this universe of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Well yeah. I mean, I'm running my own planet out across the newniverse and all. 'Course I look like puppy, though. We were Animal Tiers toge-- you're actually really cute, do you like hugs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  fwips back her /MAJESTIC MANE/. "Want to give it a try?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup Gambit... and this is gonna be fun to watch isn't it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: â€¦ *stares at her like she's crazy but tries to hug her. like. why is that even a question that needs to be asked of /course/ he wants to hug her.*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  smiles at AG --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  still tries to hug the newniverse resident. Fluffles looks so /fluffable/! Fluff everywhere!!! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  purrs like a rather large cat and rubs her fur up against AG --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  purrs back at her, similarly like a cat, and nuzzles his face into her mane. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  slides out of AG's grip and circles him again. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  considers things for a moment before prowling through the air in the other direction. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  giggles and stands up, returning to bipedal form. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  grins at her. An incredibly wide grin full of razor-sharp teeth that seems to split his whole face in two. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I /like/ you, Fluffles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Oh you do?~</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  flaunts her /MAJESTIC MANE/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  nods, still grinning. The mane is indeed majestic. "Yep~ Wouldn't've said it otherwise." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Wonderful, simply wonderful.</span><br />
