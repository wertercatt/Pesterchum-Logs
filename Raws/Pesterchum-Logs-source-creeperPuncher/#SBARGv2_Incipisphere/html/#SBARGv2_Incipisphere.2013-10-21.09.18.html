<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I'm playing Pokemon Blue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Ah! Okay... man Thats Old.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … yes. yes it is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: but all you guys are like "POKEMON X YAY" and I felt left out so</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: since I've only played through Red, I started playing Blue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 'cause it has Vulpixes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Ah... Heh. last Pokemon gaem I played was Sliver... could never get past the elite four. then again, I was YOUNG and stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've beaten Red twice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Damn.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Kadabra, I'm telling you. I love my Kadabra.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I need to get a new one… it's /way/ harder in the earlier stages of Blue without a Psychic-type ono</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Yeah... I remeber Psychic pokemon being murder machines in the first gen, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've really just started so have Illya (Level 10 Bulbasaur), Feliath (Lvl 10 Pidgey), Attaca (Lvl 9 Rattata), Adeline (Lvl 4 NidoranF), Abel (Lvl 3 NidoranM).</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And I took on the Elite Four with a Lvl 23 Kadabra and not much else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I won.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...How?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I also one-shotted Lvl 50 Moltres before doing that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because Cantarella was /badass as fuck/. Also I had a level forty-something tank Venusaur to switch out if she got too hurt, so I could heal her and send her back in to be a murder machine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: holy shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The game got much easier after I one-shotted everything x3</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: don't worry Gambit, you're not the only one alchemiter-blocked from making the new games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I can tell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: eeeh. I only really care about the Kanto 151 anyway, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm still not even at LeafGreen's midway point (by pokedex completion at least; I've made it to the island mansion thing)</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I give no fucks about dex completion. I pick up the 'mons I like and ignore the rest.</span><br />
