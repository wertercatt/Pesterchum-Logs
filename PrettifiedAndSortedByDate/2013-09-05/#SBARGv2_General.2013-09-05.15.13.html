[03:41:10] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Not just on me, too. :&gt;</span><br />
[03:41:16] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: On quite many people. :&gt;</span><br />
[03:41:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well my only class tomorrow is cancelled so ill be free all day! (when im not playing ffmq, sgng, or ffl3)</span><br />
[03:41:53] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: That's one thing of good news, SL! :&gt;</span><br />
[03:41:55] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: :D :&gt;</span><br />
[03:42:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I saw a post on tumblr that said "free buttons" so I clicked the link and it said "$1.99" and I was like "wait, what?" and then realize they were talking about the swimming anime.  :&gt;</span><br />
[03:43:23] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: softcore swimming porn</span><br />
[03:43:56] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I'm not a fan of going swimming, but swimming itself is a legitimate sport. :&gt;</span><br />
[03:44:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And it's more fun to watch than baseball. :&gt;</span><br />
[03:44:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ooh i had an idea for a possible alt  player once ive evened out sls development</span><br />
[03:45:07] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you know how ive been training on a monster-filled abandoned world?</span><br />
[03:45:14] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: yeah? :&gt;</span><br />
[03:45:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: what if i found the player of that land huddled up in some cave?</span><br />
[03:46:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: like, he didnt die immediately like i assumed, he just went into hiding from all the monsters?</span><br />
[03:46:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so he hasnt had any human contact for months and hes in a constant state of paranoia</span><br />
[03:46:33] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I almost thought I was going to do that with my character. :&gt;</span><br />
[03:46:51] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CAC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[03:47:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: on the other hand, while he wont have much equipment, he will be very good with what he does have</span><br />
[03:47:39] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...</span><br />
[03:48:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i just realized that i accidentally made arthur from ghosts n goblins</span><br />
[03:48:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: which is the game the land is based on anyway</span><br />
[03:48:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so he definitely needs to use throwingknifekind</span><br />
[03:48:50] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I was originally going to have it where my character would go in hiding from the monsters and then use rope and stuff to harness them and use them :&gt;</span><br />
[03:49:05] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: and ride on the monsters and stuff :&gt;</span><br />
[03:49:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: no, the new guy wont have done anything like that</span><br />
[03:49:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: but I decided to go a different route :&gt;</span><br />
[03:49:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: he will have just become very good at defending a small area</span><br />
[03:50:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i imagine he would also have developed a whole bunch of jerry-rigged survival tactics  too</span><br />
[03:51:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: do alts need land codes really?</span><br />
[03:51:59] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I have no idea :&gt;</span><br />
[03:52:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Honestly, I'm not really too supportive of the idea of alt characters beyond sprites :&gt;</span><br />
[03:52:21] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Or dreamselves :&gt;</span><br />
[03:52:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean i think knight of light would work well for his role in the story</span><br />
[03:53:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: (note that the consorts on this land also knew about sl for reasons unexplained, so him being light would help to explain that)</span><br />
[03:53:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I understand changing a character, or using a different one for a different roleplay :&gt;</span><br />
[03:53:45] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: But multiple players of the same person just seems a bit :&gt;</span><br />
[03:54:00] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't really know the right word :&gt;</span><br />
[03:54:04] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: anyway, it's just my opinion :&gt;</span><br />
[03:54:09] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: everyone's going to have their ow :&gt;</span><br />
[03:54:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: *own :&gt;</span><br />
[03:54:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well see sl is someone i can do pretty much as myself</span><br />
[03:54:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: an alt would be someone i need to get into the head of a bit more</span><br />
[03:55:45] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: not a serious argument, just my mindset/opinion, again, but why the need for so many alts? :&gt;</span><br />
[03:56:54] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well okay look at cc  for instance</span><br />
[03:57:22] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: that is a character that is significantly different from the player, and he immediately stands out as a result</span><br />
[03:57:57] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: now hes not an alt, since the mun is just incredible at roleplaying, but an alt gives someone a chance to do that</span><br />
[03:58:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … SL, CC /is/ an alt.</span><br />
[03:58:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: that player does DD and CC.</span><br />
[03:58:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: idk which one's a main.</span><br />
[03:58:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh ok</span><br />
[03:58:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i definitely see cc more than dd but</span><br />
[03:58:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and anyway that just proves my point more <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
[03:59:25] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: the point that an alt gives someone a chance to be different from the mun? :&gt;</span><br />
[03:59:41] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
[03:59:53] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: you can kind of do that without an alt, though :&gt;</span><br />
[03:59:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean sl is a /lot/ like me, especially since his characters development</span><br />
[04:00:08] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and i think thats true of most of us</span><br />
[04:00:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or if you're tired of a character, and want to play a new one, or just have a new char idea. Like I had ~fourteen chars in SCODE… some major, some forgotten.</span><br />
[04:00:37] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: like, I can relate to practically anyone, but I'd say my character is not really me. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:00:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and honestly, most of us are pretty similar people, at least in the sense that we all have the mindset to do a homestuck roleplay</span><br />
[04:01:06] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so theres not a lot of unusual character concepts</span><br />
[04:01:24] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Not saying it's bad to have a ton of alts, though as far as preferences go, I would much rather stick to one and develop the one :&gt;</span><br />
[04:01:34] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: rather than trying to divide time between so many :&gt;</span><br />
[04:01:51] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Yeah, I guess. That's why I had a "main" and secondary chars.</span><br />
[04:02:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:03:16] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: besides, if not experienced, as I am not a very experienced roleplayer, I wouldn't want to work with a ton of characters as I could easily get confused with their info, maybe confuse one for the other, even with the different names :&gt;</span><br />
[04:03:17] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah, this other guy would definitely be secondary</span><br />
[04:03:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well im only gonna have the one probably...</span><br />
[04:03:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I'm used to playing about five as a minimum.</span><br />
[04:03:59] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: oh wow, AG :&gt;</span><br />
[04:04:06] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: how many alts do you have here</span><br />
[04:04:12] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Then again, AG, a lot of things you do are rather unconventional. :&gt;</span><br />
[04:04:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: is everyone but me one of your alts</span><br />
[04:06:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh hey, the old code i made for an abandoned alt concept - same one that produced logal - is knight of light anyway</span><br />
[04:06:08] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so that works out</span><br />
[04:06:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: once this lobac event ends i might find the guy on logal</span><br />
[04:06:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SL, I keep my alts secrets.</span><br />
[04:07:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How the fuck would you know? :3</span><br />
[04:07:19] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...im gonna assume you are everyone</span><br />
[04:07:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe I'M one of your alts!</span><br />
[04:07:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: WHAT AM IIIIIII</span><br />
[04:08:56] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: you may be existential, but you're not a penguin :&gt;</span><br />
[04:08:57] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: that's for sure :&gt;</span><br />
[04:10:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Maybe you are.</span><br />
