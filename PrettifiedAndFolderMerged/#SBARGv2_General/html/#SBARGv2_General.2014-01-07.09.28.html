<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I hope none of you would immediately assume that some black kid was ghetto just because why the fuck wouldn't he be</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, what is the status of Navi Chips?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I think they'll probably be a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, how would they function?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: as long as the navi in question is okay with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its a summoning chip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I assume they'd create some kind of fake version of the character tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...That kinda mak- That makes even more sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: still though, you wouldn't want people using your character like that even if it weren't the actual one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: especially since the navi that the chip belongs to can create a second copy of themselves in the games</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: *that the chip is</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: probably what'll happen is that they'll leave the chip after a fight if the OOC wants to</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Style Change would obviously be limited to Navi's with Chng,BAT installed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I was thinking we might invent some new features, tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: something like style change and soul cross definitly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Style Change would be avaliable to everyone, but other than Cross Fusion, soul cross wouldn't really... work, for anyone other than megaman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we're going to make up something like it probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and then make it a downloadable program or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: might even have some plot potential if we do it right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, expanding Style Change with Navi Styles would work out, but it would require a navi chip to activate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: that might be cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For Balance reasons.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: well I mean, obviously some of the stuff would</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I just mean the organizations, tbh'</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which play a massive role in the battle network series.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: maybe sometime after megaman bn6 but before star force, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (well except for gospel)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I dunno, I just don't want them to have an extreme influence is all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it took place after BN6, we would have too many copy bots running around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: so we can do some more original stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not make an OOC rule about not having copy bots?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, obviously the main goals could be similar... but the way all of them go about doing it could be /massively different/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Its a matter of not wanting it to be at the beggining of the series or before it </span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: because the technology is kind of more fun in the later games</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, most of the tech exists before hand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, what Tech are you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but it gets more advanced over the course of the games</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: doesn't the PET go through a shit ton of upgrades from the first game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We could start out with the more advanced PETs... and upgrade it further.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wifi PETs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, it does.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, those can be done earlier in this branched timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and then also, I feel like maybe having some more original antagonist organizations might be a bit more fun</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The problem with basing it after EXE6 is Wily reforming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Why is that a problem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Wily was behind of /all/ of the organizations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not have organizations that aren't based around him</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because well... big bads, man. You can't live without them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not have a different big bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we could probably do it after the main cast is dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: i'm not totally familiar with the timeline</span><br />

<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Model W is important throughout both games</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Model W is the last traces of Dr. Weil.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: how would that work for Wily then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The answer lies in the third game, and basic computer logic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the third game, Wily was able to upload into a computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And tell me, what do you usually do to game files before making changes?</span><br />

This kanji:  魔  According to Google translalte, it means evil spirit, or similar such thing.  however, when i put it with 獣 in an attempt to get something like "demon beast", and translate it back, it translates as "magical beast".  Is there some sort of connection between evil spirits and magic in Japanese language?</span><br />
