<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: try going up or down</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: maybe I should cheat and go through the trees, or that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ac1400">CAC: not sure how to go up, at the moment</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: At least some portion of it's gonna be underwater chances are, so if anyone else is interested in showing up alchemize some aqua gear. Or don't, I'll probably be able to handle anyone who can't or forgot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Can't hurt though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably gonna be sweet loot and such, fun times all around</span><br />
