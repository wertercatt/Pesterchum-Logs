<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Anyways, we just go to the holo dojo, and select the battlefield.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: The systems will make sure that no one is hurt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: She isn't used to the sound of her own voice. And that is fine by me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  indicates the headphones barely visible under DL's hood, currently around her neck. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ready whenever ya are.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  draws his sword, a sleek blade made entirely of what would seem to be ruby. A faintly glowing blood-red gem is set in the silvery hilt. He lunges neatly for FF, having taken that as a sign the battle was to begin. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  dodges the blade,  taking out his Oni Iron Club, a 5 foot long club made of steel, swining it at him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((sometimes, people use dicerolls.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  moves past him smoothly, his mouth tightening as he notes his opponent's choice of weapon, and pivots to avoid the presumably slower-moving club. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: [[ Is it required? I am not particularly a fan of dice. ]]</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  persures, the weapon slow, but not as slow as you would think, swinging mre at him. ((and nah, IP, it's not) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Nice Sword!</span><br />
<span style="color:#809da9">CDL: ((That's coz they don't like you.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Thank you. [[ Hush, you. ]]</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  brings his blade up to parry the latest swing of the club, testing the other man's strength. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  is suprised by this, and is very strong, brining the sword down on the club. however it seems as if he's holding back. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  frowns slightly. He sidesteps, slashing downwards to cut at FF's legs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  back paddles, taking a flesh wound to his left legs, swinging the club at IP's Sword Arm somewhat fast. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  winces as he's unable to get his arm out of the way in time, but only tosses the sword to his left hand to stab in at FF. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  takes the stab to his shoulder, whincing, stepping back several steps, gaurding. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Sorry bout ya arm man, but at least it's not real.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Why apologise? This is a fight. I'm left-handed anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#165b0d">CURRENT knaveofHearts [CKH]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  steps after him with another swing of the ruby blade. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  ducks low, swinging upwards with his club. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  smiles faintly, managing to get his sword into an acceptable parry. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  countines to swings, advancing on him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  steps back, moving into a more defensive stance and bringing his sword up to block the club's blows. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  advances more, swning hards, trying to hit his chest. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  has smoothed his expression out into something more neutral. He stops backing away, instead parrying the blow to his chest and shifting slightly forward to try and run FF through, though leaving himself more open to another attack. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  notices the danger in time, letting himself get run through in the side, dropping the club, and trying to puch IP sqaure in the face. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: OW!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum's <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP'S]</span>  grip tightens on his blade as he's knocked back by the punch so that he takes it with him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Classy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  hisses in pain, holding his side in one hand, a much smaller baseball club in his other hand. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Thanks<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span> I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Nice Blow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  makes a mental note that his opponent seems to be oblivious to sarcasm and shifts his weight forward again for a smooth stab. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  dodges a bit clumsy, swinging at you left leg. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  stands his ground, the club impacting his leg as he takes the opportunity to slash down at FF. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  is slashed, drving him back., bleeding a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>Ya Good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I'm not dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  stands his ground, pulling the blade back slightly to lean forward and attempt to run FF through again. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>   mets his charges, taking another hit, this time on the other side, but at the same time trying to ram the tip of his bat into IP's chest. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  is knocked back by that, floating up briefly into the air to regain balance, the breath going out of him as he switches hands again to slash at FF despite the new range. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  easly dodges, taking a few swings at him mainly to test his defense. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ready to give up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum's <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP'S]</span>  defence is nearly impeccable as he shifts himself into a guard stance, neatly managing to block the blows. He's used to guarding another, but it extends to himself. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: You heavily insult me with those words.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh. Thats Good. wuld be kind of disappointed if ya did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  charges at him, swinging at him wildy, ready to dodge. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  pivots to the side to avoid the wild charge, his mouth tightning. He makes no attempt to counterattack. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  charges agian, swinging hard at his sword with both hands. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  The blade incandesces with red light as IP brushes his thumb over the jewel in the hilt, and this time he brings it up to meet the club, not with the flat but the edge. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  makes hurridy tries to move as much of himself as bossible out of the way, eyes widening, even as his club mets hi sword --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Oh Shi-!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Surely you didn't think that this close to the endgame, I would have naught but a regular sword?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span> yeah. I have my endgame weapon as well but<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT infernalPendulum <span style="color:#7e2c15">[CIP]</span>  The sword ought to cut into, if not through, the club… even as with his weapon occupied, IP mimics a move of FF's from earlier by delivering a punch to hsi face. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I said nothing about this being my endgame weapon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: True-*face punched*.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#aaaa7f">[CFF]</span>  is puched in the face, sending him tumbling to the ground but quickly getting to hs feet, shielding himself with a large, oddly dull folding chair. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I don't fight for the pleasure of it. To return your insult from earlier, you are of course free to give up at any point in time.</span><br />
