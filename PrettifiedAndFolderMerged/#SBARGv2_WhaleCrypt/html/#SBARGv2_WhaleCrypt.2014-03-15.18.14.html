[07:31:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  The curtain shocks her initially, but is easily pulled aside, revealing...a decently large chamber actually, one that looks nice. In the center is a large spire, sitting on a smooth stone cylinder, a basin beneath filled with the water that came from the rivers above. On either side of the room are other cylinders, in front of those are two symbols, one looking like a circle, and the other looking like a set of 3 s --</span><br />

[07:32:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  But the most shocking feature, probably, is that hanging all over the walls are shreds of cloth in every color imaginable, and on these scraps are god tier symbols.
