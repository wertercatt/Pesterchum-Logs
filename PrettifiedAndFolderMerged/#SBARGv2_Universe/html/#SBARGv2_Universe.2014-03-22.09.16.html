[12:59:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why not play games?</span><br />
[13:00:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like Godfield?</span><br />
[13:00:34] <span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Godfield?</span><br />
[13:01:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why would I play games when I have a mystery to solve</span><br />
[13:02:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because we don't have any leads.</span><br />
[13:02:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its a matter of waiting for a planet to explode.</span><br />
[13:02:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Planets have already been exploding!</span><br />
[13:02:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then figure out in which direction its happening.</span><br />
[13:03:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It started in that solar system we let her out in but then it just stopped like she just didn't do it anymore</span><br />
[13:03:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then I was like "Okay that lead is dead" so I tried to find another lead, found the Library.</span><br />
[13:04:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe someone managed to shoot her in the head already?</span><br />
[13:04:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, just some average aliens?</span><br />
[13:05:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be anticlimatic as hell, but if you treat it like reality... you know, like it /supposedly is/... it would make a lot of sense.</span><br />
[13:05:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hell, maybe.</span><br />
[13:05:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like just, BOOM, headshot.</span><br />
[13:05:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell it could have been just a normal farmer.</span><br />
[13:05:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: with a shotgun.</span><br />
[13:05:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But she did end up showing up on the chat after I saw the planet booming stop.</span><br />
[13:06:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe she got shot and stopped for a second.</span><br />
[13:07:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just start tracking if planets start going boom again.</span><br />
[13:08:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And if people live on those planets?</span><br />
[13:08:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't want to wait for things to start dying to find a lead.</span><br />
[13:08:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Though I mean in the context of serial killers sometimes that's a valid option.</span><br />
[13:09:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, you know what they say, a million is a statistic.</span><br />
[13:09:39] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, that is not what they say, that is what Stalin says.</span><br />
[13:09:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Stalin was a violent sociopath who ran the USSR!</span><br />
[13:12:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might be sad, but its the truth. We don't feel as much emotional attachment when its more than one person that dies.</span><br />
[13:12:59] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hell maybe we missed something at the library. They're already out, I gotta go back.</span><br />
[13:15:58] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe see if Yaldabaoth'll talk again.</span><br />

[13:16:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /wat/</span><br />
[13:16:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just</span><br />
[13:16:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what</span><br />
[13:17:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay so the library, right? It had these cubes, and when we put the cubes in the slot this like</span><br />
[13:17:23] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Holo-Baoth appeared and chatted us up</span><br />
[13:17:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( you know what, lets just let Ash and Kaylen deal with this if they show up ))</span><br />
[13:17:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And then it stopped talking when Isaac started asking it about trading cards</span><br />
[13:19:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually it might've just been a picture but Rob's magic ~Heart senses~ hissed at the hologram or...something.</span><br />
[13:19:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe Rob was coughing up a hairball.</span><br />
[13:19:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[13:20:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So apparently its just that the body of a denizen can't go through the door and shit</span><br />
[13:21:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I actually don't even think it was a real denizen.</span><br />
[13:21:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it was just an animated picture, like if you read a book about a denizen.</span><br />
[13:22:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Signs point to it being a soul.</span><br />
[13:22:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So a denizen soul made it through a door.</span><br />
[13:23:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or likely through a defence portal.</span><br />
[13:23:21] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Now that would make more sense, but why a defense portal?</span><br />
[13:23:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But really, the door seems close to a defense portal in some ways</span><br />
[13:24:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're a Heart hero right can't you do a soul-talkey thing.</span><br />

[21:04:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably because there weren't enough people participating. ➜</span><br />
