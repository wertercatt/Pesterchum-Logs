[01:03:45] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: sooooooo what sorta fuckup happened this morning?</span><br />
[01:04:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't know, Charles is being weird.</span><br />
[01:04:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Rob was really shifty eyed about Kat last night maybe he turned her into a ghost.</span><br />
[01:04:25] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: oh wait I can just check the blog made exactly for recording your mistakes- wait what</span><br />
[01:04:26] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: a ghost?</span><br />
[01:04:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hypnos, does the term "Temporal Melodia" mean anything to you?</span><br />
[01:04:57] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: Nope.</span><br />
[01:05:03] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: ...I think.</span><br />
[01:05:15] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: ....Yeah, nope.</span><br />
[01:05:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Rob's a Heart hero who had a major crush on Kat or something</span><br />
[01:05:40] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So he probably cried about it and melodramatically turned her into a ghost</span><br />
[01:05:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so we don't have another dimentional traveler it seems.</span><br />
[01:05:50] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: ((SNRK))</span><br />
[01:06:28] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: I don't get it.</span><br />
[01:06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which means SH is either someone from this universe that managed to get /wished in/, or... I have no idea.</span><br />
[01:06:49] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: well</span><br />
[01:07:11] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: it could also be possible that they are from a dimention where that term has no meaning</span><br />
[01:07:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe he could have had his memory wiped.</span><br />
[01:07:49] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: I'm just a ghost, I don't think it could be that complicated...I think.</span><br />
[01:08:14] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nah he's probably just little bits of Kat's soul, sounds like something Rob'd be capable of.</span><br />
[01:08:15] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: rule number seven: more often than not, it can get more complicated.</span><br />
[01:08:39] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: Who even is Kat</span><br />
[01:08:59] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: some person who died idk</span><br />

[01:09:18] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: "Who even is" at the name of a new person, sounds like TT</span><br />

[01:09:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Woah, y'know actually</span><br />
[01:09:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, it does</span><br />
[01:10:06] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And the "Hypnos" bit</span><br />
[01:10:10] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: The colors are wrong.</span><br />
[01:10:21] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: and I don't have weird scarf hands.</span><br />
[01:10:36] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: This is a pretty cool drawing though.</span><br />
[01:10:57] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: when what are the /right/ colors and im just going to assume you have claws for hands if not specified</span><br />
[01:11:40] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: Though...I guess it looks /kind of/ familiar? Not exactly sure.</span><br />
[01:11:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, might just be an alternate version.</span><br />
[01:12:12] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: My mind is currently a mixed fruit smoothie, so...</span><br />
[01:12:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like if... I had an alternate universe version of me with ice powers.</span><br />
[01:12:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: He'd probably be just as lame.</span><br />
[01:12:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, likely the case.</span><br />
[01:13:11] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I'm almost 100% this is probably some soul fragment or something because Rob's a necrosomnophiliac.</span><br />
[01:13:17] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: also, I don't have that weird two-colored eye thing...I think.</span><br />
[01:13:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Details details, you're a ghost you're probably low def.</span><br />
[01:13:50] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: I am not a television</span><br />
[01:13:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...The other eye is covered. You would not be able to know if the other one was a different color.</span><br />
[01:14:09] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....</span><br />
[01:14:37] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well I mean, maybe if you weren't a ghost and were a tangible person you'd have all these features.</span><br />
[01:14:48] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But you're just a ghostly fragment, so you're probably missing some clear cut ones.</span><br />
[01:14:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe you're a completely different person or something.</span><br />
[01:15:08] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ...</span><br />
[01:15:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Therefore, you would have to /know/ that the other eye was a different color through other means!</span><br />
[01:16:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...does the name Raine mean anything to you?</span><br />
[01:16:36] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: Uhh...no</span><br />

[01:23:15] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The firebender or Charles, I haven't seen him start any fires in ever.</span><br />
[01:23:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I've only ever seen him rip off Rob's Heart-y moves once or twice</span><br />
[01:51:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a tube going into my arm.</span><br />

[02:08:40] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: hm</span><br />
[02:08:56] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: Is this about that weird destroyer of worlds thing mentioned yesterday?</span><br />
[02:09:10] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, Galactus showed up and arrested Charles.</span><br />

[02:09:20] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: someone needs to explain that to me</span><br />
[02:09:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So this girl who can copy aspects or something got let out of Space-jail by Isaac and Jacien.</span><br />
[02:09:53] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And kicked everybody's ass and ran away to go destroy the universe.</span><br />
[02:10:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or something to that effect, I was KO'd most of the fight.</span><br />
[02:10:12] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: good job</span><br />
[02:10:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And supposedly I told you that it was a bad idea, according to CC.</span><br />
[02:10:24] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Actually Niki hit her with a TV dinner and that hurt her hard or something.</span><br />
[02:10:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which is neat.</span><br />
[02:10:37] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: lame weakness</span><br />
[02:10:51] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: TV dinner.</span><br />
[02:10:53] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: huh.</span><br />
[02:11:05] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: but yeaaaaaaah that whole mess-up kinda changes some plans</span><br />
[02:11:09] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: weelp</span><br />
[02:11:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What we need is more dakka.</span><br />
[02:11:24] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: thanks guys</span><br />
[02:11:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Supposedly physical attacks worked more than anything else.</span><br />
[02:11:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if it bleeds... you can kill it.</span><br />
[02:12:21] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and if you can kill it, I can kill it faster</span><br />
[02:12:30] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ...</span><br />
[02:13:00] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Lol</span><br />
[02:13:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, lets actually send non players to kill it.</span><br />
[02:13:30] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: ...Hopefully they don't turn into a ghost.</span><br />
[02:13:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably not, Rob's a million times better than ~90% of the players and and he couldn't beat 'em.</span><br />
[02:13:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since it can drain aspect powers</span><br />
[02:13:45] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: She, I think.</span><br />
[02:14:15] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: but yeah does this person just copy the aspects or the entire classpect itself</span><br />
[02:14:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...no ideqa.</span><br />
[02:14:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We don't even know her class.</span><br />
[02:14:41] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: because if its the entire classpect then that'll cause some problems</span><br />
[02:14:53] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: an aspect without a class has little use</span><br />
[02:15:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Her class was definitely "pushed our shit in" class</span><br />
[02:15:40] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: eh still</span><br />
[02:16:25] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: if i and some other jerks have to go kill them, id rather know what to expect. being crunched by spacepowers or somthing along those lines is not fun</span><br />
[02:17:12] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: She was using Breath last I remember.</span><br />
[02:17:58] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: oh so windy-stuff</span><br />
[02:18:00] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: thats easy okay</span><br />
[02:19:00] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: Depends on how it's used, maybe.</span><br />
[02:19:40] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: eh, use something made of really heavy metal</span><br />
[02:19:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not gonna lie, that's a stupid plan.</span><br />
[02:19:59] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: because it'll take a lot of effort to make that thing go flying at least</span><br />
[02:20:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We're talking about god tiers, I can swing planets around with not a whole lotta effort.</span><br />
[02:20:54] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: well you are space, thats kinda cheating. and besides we dont even know what class this person may be.</span><br />
[02:21:05] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: How do they do the megamans/kurbey thing?</span><br />
[02:21:22] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no idea, she took a cloth with the breath symbol on it, her shirt like, ate it.</span><br />
[02:21:32] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then she turned into a Breath hero.</span><br />
[02:21:32] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: what the shit</span><br />
[02:22:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Then she KO'd me in like a /punch/.</span><br />
[02:22:21] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: weaaaaaaaaak</span><br />
[02:22:43] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: She turned a Space punch around on me without even blinking.</span><br />
[02:22:47] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: ...so uh...</span><br />
[02:23:03] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: and you yourself manipulate space</span><br />
[02:23:11] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: what about..not wearing anything with those symbols?</span><br />
[02:23:12] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: cmon you can do better than that</span><br />
[02:23:34] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: well that might get rid of the power-stealing thing</span><br />
[02:23:39] <span style="color:#099d71">CSH: or is it any piece of clothing as long as it's worn by a "player"</span><br />
[02:23:52] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have no idea.</span><br />
[02:24:05] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean it's not like we even had a Breath hero with us though.</span><br />
[02:24:11] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: 'that also might be the case. players can really escape from their aspect so who knows.</span><br />
