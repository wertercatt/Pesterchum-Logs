<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: It is a VERY nasty flick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is confused, but warned --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: No. I'm dead serious. Watch this movie at your own risk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Meet the Feebles, a 1989 movie directed by Peter Jackson, is basically The Muppets on crack and lots of hard liquor. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Crack mixed with Meth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He also made The Frighteners, which wasn't so gory, but was a horror comedy. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And actually, the Frighteners is a pretty good movie :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: The Frighteners?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's a movie where Michael J. Fox can see ghosts :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and he exorcises ghosts :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Get the hell out of here! That type of movie exsists?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's actually a pretty good movie, imo :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: a bit cheesy, but not anything like meet the feebles :&gt;</span><br />
Dž: I'm leåvįng nøw before my ÎRČ corrupts itself anymore<br />

<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Meet the Feebles made me throw up a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: CG, SJ, if you get the chance, watch The Frighteners. It's kind of like Ghost Busters and Beetlejuice. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I see if I can find it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: GHOSTBUSTERS AND BEETLEJUICE? HELL THE FUCK YEAH</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think they have it on netflix, though if you don't have netflix, you may be able to find it on a movie streaming site. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Wait, is that the guy who played Marty in Back to The Futre?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: OH. My. God.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So imagine Marty McFly a little older and able to talk to and see ghosts. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Maan i'm looking for this movie right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Do it. Watch it if you can. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Which, neither I have seen. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: The Original. Screw the remake.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: The remake at least had David Tennant in it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: It doesn't have the campy ness</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: ...Really? Wow I didn't see him in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP:  <a href='#TheMoreYouKnow'>#TheMoreYouKnow</a> :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: David Tennant as Peter Vincent :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Oh wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Charley goes to Las Vegas magician Peter Vincent (David Tennant), a supposed expert on vampires. Peter doesn't take him seriously, and kicks him out. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: EP, you remember the (Removed due to possible NSFW kick. ) song?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: CG, I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: How about you just say it since NN isn't here? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: It's going to be hard to understand the context otherwise. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: The Sodomy song.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: From Meet the feebles? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Yeeah..</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Pretty hard song to not remember. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: That movie was pretty much refuge in audacity and vulgarity, though. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Yeah..</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though it's funny, because his wife actually wrote the film. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well, future wife.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: He directed it and she wrote it. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: They got married sometime later. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: It's a vulgar, disgusting, movie. But I can't look away from it.</span><br />
