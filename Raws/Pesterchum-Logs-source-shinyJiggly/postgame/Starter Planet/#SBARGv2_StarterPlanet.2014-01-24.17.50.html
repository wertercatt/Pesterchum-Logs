<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is it toomch to ask for some reason to actually have contact with others? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I'm losing my faith in humanity. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what little sliver of it is left. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  keeps walking --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: To be honest Humanity sold out a long time ago. With the huge money and corperations, and the back stabbing and paid assassins...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  stops walking. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stops following, a short distance from them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I have humans where I come from... well, this is true but im not technically "from" anywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...okay, I'm confusednow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  glances around a bit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  points at herself. "I am a synthetic life from. A Prodcut of Science like a robot. Only, fully organic." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Made possible by a huge company.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I, did not know that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Humans are all around the galaxy by now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((whoa whoa whoa, back up the bus, is Fluffy a "Freefall" reference?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...seriously??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Bowman's Wolves?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: (( ...actually now that you mention itl... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: (( i never thought about it like that but yes you could say that ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, we're not exactly as alone as I thought... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Of course not. Humans are durable as f*#k.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: No one could keep them down for long. There was even a time where they were surpressed by aliens who showed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: And you know what they did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: They kicked a$$.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: And took their planet back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sounds like the plot to an action movie, to be honest. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Thats probably where they got their ideas.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  laughs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess that's one more reason to get into space. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: suppose so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...Thats right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: You guys wanted to get to space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  looks back at her ship. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: You know... it's not much...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: But if you have a Hanger or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I could help out with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Shon might be able to help with that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: he's the other space player around here, total star trek geek. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. also a persistent no-show.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...well that is a bit of a set back</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, we were gonna take his ship, but he tends to be kinda flakey. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I remember Ben always wanted to go on some sorta crazy ambitioous space road trip... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...was he the one from the other day?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the life player dude with the neckbeard? yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...rough...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  yawns and uncaptchas a piece of chocolate --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: ...You seem like... Okay people. I want to help you out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it mostly depends on the group and the occasion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thanks for not completely losing hope though, it means a lot. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  nods. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Just remember that you can always get back up. Seriously. I've seen it time and time again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  grins. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  smiles partially --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup. there's no such thing as "too low to come back from".</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  checks memo on her glassestop --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...do you think it's safe to re-enter the bar yet? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or are they still going to convince me that any form of interaction isn't going to end well? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  shrugs. "Maybe you just need a different place to hang out. I mean, Bars are great and all, but a change of scenery is good." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that might be a good idea, though I because certain people tend to avoid the memos, i'm worried about feeling like I'm abandoning them... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seeing as literally the only reson why I went there today was because nobody was online. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Well... I'll just be over there working if you need me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: let us know if you need help, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  nods and heads over to the unfinished ship and gets back to work on it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  returns to the bar, may as well... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  just walks home, clearly the bar is too volitile to visit --</span><br />
