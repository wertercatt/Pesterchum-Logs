[11:54:14] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: which is why the lot of you annoy me</span><br />
[11:54:30] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: thinking you can just cheat the system like that</span><br />
[11:54:33] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: which eventu▲lly cΘmes b▲ck when yΘu kill ▲nΘther thing yΘu deem "c▲ncerΘus"</span><br />

[11:58:04] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: oy i kinda take offence to that upon reflection- uh</span><br />
[11:58:27] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i know little about souls. i myself dont even have one so</span><br />
