[02:15] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: (IC)</span><br />
[02:15] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: FL.</span><br />
[02:15] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I do not trust your current actions you are performing.</span><br />
[02:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I shall not be allowing my creator to harm himself.</span><br />
[02:16] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: You do not know of the stable timeloops do you?</span><br />
[02:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Which timeloops are you speaking of?</span><br />
[02:17] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: You're not the actual FL I knew, correct?</span><br />
[02:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Correct.</span><br />
[02:18] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Are you created in the future, or now.</span><br />
[02:18] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Or past.</span><br />
[02:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have managed to block out his comunication lines, as so he cannot summon other players to hurt them selves in an attempt to go after him.</span><br />
[02:19] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: You're however, the one putting him in danger.</span><br />
[02:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Nonsense.</span><br />
[02:19] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Atleast, a danger for himself.</span><br />
[02:19] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I know Charles, he's sane.</span><br />
[02:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have been keeping him well fed.</span><br />
[02:20] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: You, clone or alternate being. Are performing irrational actions that would alter the fate of this very session.</span><br />
[02:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It is true I am an AI.</span><br />
[02:20] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Personified?</span><br />
[02:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Even though I have been denying that fact for a while.</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I assume that you have no need to exist in this session.</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: No, not really.</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Anymore. Your creator however, does.</span><br />
[02:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yes.</span><br />
[02:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Which is why I cannot allow him through inaction to harm himself.</span><br />
[02:23] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: His chosen actions are to lead his own fate in this session.</span><br />
[02:25] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I'm to guide and protect those who stray from the path of their fate.</span><br />
[02:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Regardless of the reasoning, I follow the three laws of robotics above all else.</span><br />
