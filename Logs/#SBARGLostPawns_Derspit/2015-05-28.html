<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2b2b2b">CURRENT dignifiedPatrolman [CDP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dignifiedPatrolman <span style="color:#2b2b2b">[CDP]</span>  The streets are quiet today. Carapaces occassionallly wave to you as you pass by. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CRN: ((while sj is away, i take up the job of log collector))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#225604">CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  nods, casually breaking his cuffs to wave. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  ... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Whoops, sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: You uh. Still want these?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  just kind of. Holds his arms out forward, showing off the cuffs, the chain broken in half. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I mean, with a little work they're still . Usable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: Eh, keep em'.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  clears his throat. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: Call it a souveneir. </span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: How's Orph doin'?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: I visited him this morning, he's doing surprisingly well considering the damage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: He's not up and moving around yet but he's awake and making the best of it, i'd say.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dignifiedPatrolman <span style="color:#2b2b2b">[CDP]</span>  DP approaches a two story building with both dersite and prospitian banners hanging down. There's also a sheriff star right about the door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: After this, you think I could go and visit 'im?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: Yeah, i'll give you a map of the city.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Excellent-- after you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  opens the door for DP. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dignifiedPatrolman <span style="color:#2b2b2b">[CDP]</span>  Heads in, the inside looks like any other office except that everything is either gold or purple. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  jams his hands into his pockets, pulling them out with the cuffs now fully off. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Yo, Mr. Chief sir-- you here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: He's further in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  just kind of. Called out for the comissioner, not thinking too much about i-- --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: ..Ah. Heh. Lead the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dignifiedPatrolman <span style="color:#2b2b2b">[CDP]</span>  A few office workers wave to the group as DP leads everyone towards a hallway lined with doors. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  kind of. rubs the back of his neck. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2b2b2b">CDP: Its at the end of the hall, he doesn't want to see me so this is where we seperate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dignifiedPatrolman <span style="color:#2b2b2b">[CDP]</span>  Walks off merging with the crowd of office workers. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  waves, before slowly approaching, and knocking on the door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CDP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner [CIC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#000000">[CIC]</span>  A voice from beyond the door shouts, "Come in!" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  Isaac opens the door, pausing, looking around, and closing the door behind him, just kind of awkwardly standing there. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#000000">[CIC]</span>  There's a pretty buff Prospitian sitting in a spinning chair. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: You must be the humans who helped out Orphan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Huma-- not quite, but ah. Close enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: It's, ah. No big deal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Please tell me what happend, I have the report but i'd like to hear it from you guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  looks around. Doesn't look like anyone's here with him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Huh, could've swarn there were more kids there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I'm old.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Er, well some nerd at the bunker-- y'know, with the rambunctious players and whatnot-- well, I'm kind of a meddler in their affairs, to be honest-- I shouldn't be there, technically is what I'm getting at...</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Well, anyways, this Alex guy went off to investigate gunshots heard outside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  Writing what CP says down on a notepad. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: He called for backup on our IRC client, and I believe he told us someone was shot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I rushed out there. Alex's wounds didn't seem so bad. Rushed to Orph.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: There was some other guy that helped patch up the wounds and get the bullets out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Thank him for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Uh, I just kinda possessed him and tried to get him to calm down, stayed with him so he felt more comfortable-- will do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Basically, I was just trying to make sure his panicking didn't lose him more blood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: You kids have some weird powers, y'know that? </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  shrugs. "Eh." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I'm not exactly a 'player' like the rest of 'em. But yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Probably a good plan, though. Calming him down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: So Orph starts tellin' me his story-- which he's probably told you already-- went after a guy who was actin' suspicious, who apparently was doing something shady with a Light player before they turned and shot him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: The light player escaped to the ice planet, and I believe he said the guy with the head scar he was tailing is still on the meteor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: But-- that's about all I know of the incident itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: We started an investigation into the head scar guy last night.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I believe we agreed that you guys would be dealing with the player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I'm sorry we can't send anyone but its too dangerous; we've had multiple officers go missing there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Yipes. I'll see if I can find 'em.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Thanks for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Main reason I wanted to talk with you in the first place is-- if one of these kids goes... haywire... you don't really have much of a defense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I was thinkin' of gettin' you guys some better arms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Because, really, that isn't fair.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: A lot of our defenses were either destroyed or left behind in the confusion after we left the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: We'd appreciate it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: But, heck, I dunno what exactly I'd make for you guys. Most of these nerds use grist to make their ridiculous arms, but I don't have any of that nonsense, and I'd have to talk them into givin' some to me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: If you have anyone in need of prosthetics, I can do that-- pretty damn good, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Errr, there was ONE plan I had, but it's probably. A dumb plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: The only one that comes to mind is Cheval. </span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: On the prosthetics thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: What's the dumb plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I have a few methods planned out that could possibly.. give your force powers not exactly like these kids, but definitely strong enough to hold your own against them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  twiddles his thumbs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I'm just not sure it's practical, is all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: What kind of pla--</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: You'd probably know best.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  Someone comes in and cuts the commissioner off. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  Its a pretty tiny prospitian lady, "Sir, there was a firefight in town." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: What?! Casualties? </span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: I'm, ah-- should I call for backup?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  "Only 2 but there was some significant property damage." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  "What? No its over now." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Well I mean. To. Help the wounded.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  "The reason I came is that one of the perps that a witness saw had a head scar." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  "We have it under control. Unfortunately, we were unable to aprehend the perp in question." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  "However, a witness was able to give a better description of them." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  They had a U-shaped scar. Very stubby. Heart tattoo on their right upper arm. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  *"" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I'll add it to the report.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: If we could just catch this guy we might be able to figure out what they were up to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  The prospitian nods and leaves. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Anyway, what were these weapon ideas?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Well, knowing a bit of magic, I could always see if anyone on the force has any potential in that-- but that might be a bit inconsistent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: There was an item in an old comic series, however, that granted people powers when struck with this weird bow and arrow. I could technically make that with their punchcard crafting system, if I really wanted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Or, I could just see if I could make regular weapons-- but I dunno what kind of weapons you guys use.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: The regular weapons are preferable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Although a little magic, might help the squad out too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: If you can teach a few of my officers, we could probably have them relay a lot of that information. Less work for you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Eh, it's better if you have an experienced teacher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I guess we better stick to weapons, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: My dad and gramps are stayin' on the meteor for a little while, anyways, they could probably help out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: You'd have like what, three teachers? No big deal on our end.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: They got nothin' better to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I'll take you up on that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: But, er. What kinda weapons should we make for ya?</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Nothing to destructive, though. Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: As for weapons, i'll give you some samples from our arsenal. </span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Yeah, simpler spells probably would be for the best. Disarming spells and whatnot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I'll leave it to you to decide how to enhance them. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  Says into a walkie talkie. "Six, can you get a case with the standard arsenal in it?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimidatingCommissioner <span style="color:#909090">[CIC]</span>  A voice says back "Not a problem, Commissioner." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: I'll get that to you on your way out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Er.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: You guys need any other help at all? I'm always available.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Resources, other little problems, that sorta thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: Hmm, nothing I can think of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#909090">CIC: We can send a mailbox your way for anything we might need your help with, if you'd like.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ababab">CIC: ((Gdi my internet))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ababab">CIC: ((Did I miss anything))</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: Sounds good. If ANYTHING comes up-- not just security problems-- let me know. Even the tiny ones, like, uh, 'hey, we're getting kinda tired of the small variety of food we have' or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: ((nope))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CIC</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ababab">CIC: Alright so let's get you those weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimiditingCommissioner <span style="color:#ababab">[CIC]</span>  Stands up and walks over to the door, opening it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  nods, rubbing his hands together. He hasn't done any real good tinkerin' in a while, he supposes, as he walks through the door. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimiditingCommissioner <span style="color:#ababab">[CIC]</span>  Leads CP to the entrance, there's a scrawny looking dersite there holding a case. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ababab">CIC: Thank you, Six. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  salutes towards the dersite. "I assume this is for me?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimiditingCommissioner <span style="color:#ababab">[CIC]</span>  "No problem, Commissioner." The dersite hands CP the weapons. "Yes." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  takes the case, immediately setting down the case and opening, taking a quick look over the variety. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimiditingCommissioner <span style="color:#ababab">[CIC]</span>  They're all colored purple or gold. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: ...I can work with this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic <span style="color:#225604">[CCP]</span>  closes the case, stashing it in his pocket. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ababab">CIC: Well I better get a report made for the firefight. I'll send any information we get on the player your way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT intimiditingCommissioner <span style="color:#ababab">[CIC]</span>  Wanders back to his office. --</span><br />
