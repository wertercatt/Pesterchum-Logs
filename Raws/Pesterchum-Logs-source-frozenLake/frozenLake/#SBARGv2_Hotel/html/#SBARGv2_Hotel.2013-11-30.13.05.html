[08:21:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  opens it up, and looks inside. --</span><br />
[08:22:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the paper, and writes a message. --</span><br />
[08:22:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "Need more paper".</span><br />
[08:22:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has run out of space on the sheet of paper. --</span><br />
[08:22:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  flips it over for him. --</span><br />
[08:22:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  begins to transcribe "Dispel Magic". --</span><br />
[08:25:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  watches him in fascination, helpfully adding a second piece of paper to his cage. --</span><br />
[08:26:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  needs to use 3.5 sheets of paper total, using both sides of them. --</span><br />
[08:26:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is okay with giving him more paper as the situation warrants. --</span><br />
[08:26:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is... finally done. --</span><br />
[08:27:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So… I read this, yeah?</span><br />
[08:27:50] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  nods. --</span><br />
[08:28:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  settles down comfortably near the cage with the sheets, studying them intently. --</span><br />
[08:32:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  // This is only going to take about three hours. --</span><br />
[08:32:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has 21 hours until he loses his mind. --</span><br />
[08:32:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // No pressure. --</span><br />
[08:33:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  can still dispel the polymorph spell after 21 hours to get it /back/. --</span><br />
[08:33:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // True. --</span><br />
[09:16:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at Alanna. --</span><br />
[09:16:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is reading intently. --</span><br />
[09:17:24] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  more light snoring... --</span><br />
[09:45:04] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  can't get out of the tank. --</span><br />
[09:45:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tries to spring to the top, but he /can't/ seem to reach. --</span><br />
[09:48:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  has only been studying for an hour and fifteen minutes. --</span><br />
[09:49:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Timeskip? Y/N --</span><br />
[09:49:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //oh come on let's just fast-forward already --</span><br />
[09:49:23] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //timeskip=y --</span><br />
[09:49:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  //k sure --</span><br />
[09:49:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  blinks and looks up at FL. --</span><br />
[09:49:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The timeskip finally ends as FL has gotten the cage halfway off the table. --</span><br />
[09:50:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tackles the wall of the cage ONCE MORE. --</span><br />
[09:50:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is sitting right by the table, so raises a hand up to stop it from falling. --</span><br />
[09:50:45] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // shit falling- --</span><br />
[09:50:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slithers up the side of the tank. --</span><br />
[09:51:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey, what /are/ you doing? *tries to catch him*</span><br />
[09:51:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // STARE. --</span><br />
[09:51:55] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  doesn't speak stare. --</span><br />
[09:52:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  counterstares at the snake --</span><br />
[09:53:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I think I've got the hang of this way of dispelling magic.</span><br />
[09:54:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do you /want/ me to try it on you or not?</span><br />
[09:54:21] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  speeds over to the floor. --</span><br />
[09:55:08] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Are you done moving?</span><br />
[09:56:34] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is trying to move his clothes to the elevator. --</span><br />
[09:56:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // all he manages to do is move them /very slowly/ --</span><br />
[09:57:54] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  ignores this, focussing on the moving snake and withdrawing her stylus, stepping over to him and twirling the stylus in the air. A white shimmer begins winding around it before she slashes it downwards to break through that circular glow. "Dispel Magic!" --</span><br />
[09:58:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks... back to normal. --</span><br />
[09:58:31] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  grabs his clothes and runs away. --</span><br />
[09:58:40] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … /you're welcome/!</span><br />
[09:59:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  shrugs and pockets her stylus, turning away and heading back to the library. Yay books &lt;3 --</span><br />
[09:59:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[09:59:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stops zoning out at shenanigans, and, uh... tries to think of something to do --</span><br />
