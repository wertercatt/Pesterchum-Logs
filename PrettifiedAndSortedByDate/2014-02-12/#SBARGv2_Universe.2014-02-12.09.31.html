<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and if so, itll be on the engines apparently</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((flmun showed up in the other memo earlier and said that it was a thing and offered a way to stop it, and then subsequently taking it in his own self-contained manner, not even letting anyone freaking determine any sort of alternative. Meanwhile, some of us are wondering if it even should be a thing.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: (( bomb scare? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((self-contained thing meaning that he offered to have others make the post but then retracted the offer))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((if he refuses to do anything niki, you need to exercise your gm powers to tell him no))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((well, it's more of a preference thing with having to deal with his railroady events))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((like, he seems to have a set plan and doesn't like others to stray from it when he makes something happen))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((also if his refusal consists of "im gonna bomb the ship and theres nothing you can do about it" you need to put your foot down))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i for one am 100% behind you on doing that, idk about anyone else but))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((not to mention he usually makes his character do most of the actiony stuff in his events, unless he specifically sets something up for someone to do "correctly", which he'll endlessly hint at the answer for.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((maybe I should stop complaining about him at this hour.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((nah, its cool))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((youre 200% right, though he did do that one dogscape event p well))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((Sorry, I don't really have to give a fuck about this but you guys kind of do. And it's not your fault Niki, don't sweat it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((Just, like he said. If things get a little too railroady don't hesitate to step in and say so, and if he doesn't adjust himself, that's what being a GM is for))</span><br />
