<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like scion is ever gonna fucking happen again after this</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe we should think about puting the backup skype chat back into active use, but that might be rude and hurtful. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: backup skype chat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I also already said that as long as nothing is further brought up to them the rest of the day, scion probably will still happen...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also backup skype chat what</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: bullshit cp</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not even sure if I should have even mentioned it's existence. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the main memo's already calmed down</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because you fucking know ash is gonna passive-aggressively fudge the rolls so i cant do anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i am so pissed at ash right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why is it that I want to mention opinions about her but I'm worried that they'll be too rude and be heard by kaylen again?  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: cant be any worse than what im saying</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: believe me, I'm being way too rude even alluding to them. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i like how she shut me down talking about fucking /gng/ because BLUH TRIGGERS but me being sent into blind rage is a horrible misuse of the term</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you didnt see me shaking with tears in my eyes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I feel like I'm expected to have an obligation to be here, considering I'm apparently supposed to be a gm, and hence in a position of power. All I ever wanted to do was work on a couple interesting projects with a solid base to work off of. I never wanted to become a representitive for anything or be regareded as having any sort of power besides a couple of minor artistic freedoms with unimportant plot things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#8400c6">CPT: SL let me ask you</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but the point is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: when i had my faith, a faith thats a huge part of who i am, a faith that ive had since i was a child, compared to ancient myths that are now used for fucking superhero movies insulted</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and then when i was called silly for saying something</span><br />

<span style="color:#8400c6">CPT: People still worship those, "ancient myths"</span><br />
<span style="color:#8400c6">CPT: And your faith has had movies based off of it too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just because my reaction to panicking is to lash at out whoever caused the attack instead of curling up into a ball and crying doesnt make it any less of a panic attack</span><br />
