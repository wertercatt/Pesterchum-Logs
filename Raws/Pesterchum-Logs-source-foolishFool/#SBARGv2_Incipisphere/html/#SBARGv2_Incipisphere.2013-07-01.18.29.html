<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Boondollar is a value of 1, Boonbuck is 1,000,000...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its 10^33 boondollars.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: WE HAVE TO COLLECT AS MUCH SW337 L007 AS POSSIBLE!</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EVERYONE GO TO THE DREAM MOONS AND GRIND MAIL QUESTS LIKE TOMORROW NEVER HAPPENED!</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: LET'S DO ALL THE DUNGEONS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: ALL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: OF.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: THEM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least it isn't a googol.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would be fucked then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: THANK GOD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wasn't there a point in time when we pretty much had a zilion boondollars?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: or a googolplex</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the Final Lore Dungeon on LOSACrystal is supposed to be full of SW33T L00T... BUT I'M STILL FOUR LEVELS BELOW THE ENTRY REQUIREMENT FROGDAMMIT</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: or however τhaτ's spelled</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TT, if it was a googolplex, we would never reach it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (however, once I meet the (level &gt;= 550) req, I can bring anyone no matter what /their/ level)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Even if we turned every parficle in our old universe into a boondollar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: I just maxed out, but I can't find ANY of my dungeons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Whelp. time to tap into doomed universes, then. they don't need the boonbucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: Good luck with that, FF.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF, it isn't that price</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't worry</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ....?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a googolplex in price.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Still, It's a good idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it was, we wouldn't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And wouldn't the physical objects be doomed too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Not if we steal them!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: We can make out like bandits!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF stop being an idiot about timetravel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: boonmoney is not so much physical objects as points. like grist doesn't actually exist on the physical plane even though it appears to</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If timeclones are doomed, what about boondollar timeclones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's not time travel! it's just accessing alternate dimensions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe4811">CPO: Who here is a Time/Space hero?</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: *just*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you don't mess with paradox space. it will slap you down faster than you can say "oops i brok it"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm a heart hero, so I guess I shouldn't be talking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#1815ea">CEQ: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm a time player</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I guess I can tell that its a stupid idea still?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I'm also a heart player. really wish we had a rage palyer. could break the limits of things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I work with the "essence" of stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heart, Soul, Essence.</span><br />
