<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Like SE incites squabbling, mostly through people targetting him. I tend to accurately psychoanalyze people and bring up things they don't like. Gambit wants to know ALL THE THINGS and steals the Void(the unknown) in her actions by being so curious and getting in everyone's business. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: PO, wha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: I want CA to do a Title-based social analysis on me</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmmm Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ok then. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Woot</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As a Knight of Hope you tend to "weaponize" your Hope towards achieving your goals. You seem to have a boundless enthusiasm but you don't seem to lend Hope to others. Often your actions leave othe rplayers irked but they are always done with the best intentions in mind.  Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Basically you provide Hope for yourself and use it to move forward but can't do the same for others. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: social analanak??</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Welll, I have it on good authority that I give good advice, and help people out whenever, however</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: So that,s not entirely correct</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: But mostly it is! :-) </span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but it is. Advice is not the same as Hope though they can be linked if you do so with the intent to provide more options or good feelings. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Which I dooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: (⌣_⌣”)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Not done yet. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Furthermore when you do advise other you tend to provide yourself with Hope first before you act and help them. Just because you sometimes give good advice doesn't mean you can give Hope to others all the time. Its more that you use your own Hope to bolster your efforts, using your near infinite cheer to effect others. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh hey nak</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: um</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whats that mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: I see! So, I'm kinda like the spritely little brother of the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: There's just...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So many bad things happening here</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Gotcha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but yeah um</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Now, as for you naK you have a rather interesting effect as the Bard of Void. As a passive destructive class you interact with your element indirectly. Whereas Gambit actively steals from the unknown by finding things out, you tend to be a maker and builder. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i know you and amy were friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sorry i killed her</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ By your actions though you enable your aspect to be destroyed and find enjoyment in it's destruction. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Void is the unknown and the aspect of nothingness. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ By indirectly "destroying" Void, you tend to be the one to facilitate the making and learning of new things and ideas. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Naaaaak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nak.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I notice that you tend to like making items and learning new things. You started out with almost no knowledge of human speech and have been teaching yourself how to speak it. You even helped others come up with new ideas and nicknames. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so say we all</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and CA, I think I might jump on this too after MP's turn...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmm well Time is all about uncertainty and inevitability. As the Prince of Time I've noticed that you've been in situations where you've either had to be decisive in your actions or suffer some consequence. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Time is also about patience and destruction. You're somewhat impatient at times and manage to be the one to "heal" your comrads both physicaly and mentally when the Time calls for it. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I was contacted about the situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Being a Prince is all about using your aspect to destroy your aspect. You fight uncertainty and inevitability with your own timing. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but you just so happened to be on at the Time and immediately moved to help when called to do so. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555500">CPK: coool</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As for CP, you weaponize Light for yourself. This means using your knowledge and luck for your own gain. Its noted though that Knights don't really start out with a lot of their element and have to grow into using it mroe effectively. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ...is a Witch of Light... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ok so for you CP you actively change Light. Light being the aspect of luck and knowledge. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ What I've noticed is that people tend to rely on your to change things in their favor. Your portals are vital to dungeoneering and you work on changing the level of knowledge of everyone by actively seeking new things. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ You are all about change and are active in seeing that change through. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do me next</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Spaaaaaaace Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Space is a tricky one</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup, sounds about rig-- pfffffffft</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Let's see how you play this one out Reid</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well Space is all about creation, being the polar opposite of Time, and it's all about movement and position of objects. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  waits --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  waits for the chance to show off the Sweet Loot he made --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Well not all about that but it's the main thing. Matter and such. </span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ To be honest your role is somewhat similar to Jade's. Space is all about, as MP said, creation, spatial distance, the actual location of something, with minor emphasis on size and velocity. But added onto that is the idea of self image and pieces of things as well which ties into it's social aspect. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yay I was right about that!</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: K sorry go on.</span><br />

<span style="color:#830000">CNK: nak?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ I've noticed that as the game has gone on you've been willing to change yourself (be it through actions, tactics, or what have you) to meet the goals you have set for yourself. You have also actively worked to change others (though not always successfully) and how they view themselves and others. You tend to be abel to piece things together quite well and are able to create new ideas and plans from the</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">smallest scraps of information. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#555500">[CPK]</span>  thinks CA has this all written out --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd like some more substantial evidence to them accusations, but I'd have to say you're sounding more accurate than I gave you credit for.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Third part also yes, first part is... I can see it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ For an example of the *changing how others see things* I'll point to your plan a while back with Rob. You guys tried to use how people see you and him as a way of hiding your plans until you could act on them. Σ</span><br />

<span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Soooooo Breath is about motivation, direction, freedom, and questing. Breath players see a goal they want, and pursue it, overcoming anything they may face in the way. Breath players are usually curious, and carefree. I've noticed that you seem to be pretty free-spirited but also compassionate and are willing to overcome the odds to help others.
