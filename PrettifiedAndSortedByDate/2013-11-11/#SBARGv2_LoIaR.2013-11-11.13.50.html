<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, so I didn't /actually/ take an hour to get through there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...still felt like it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anything happen yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, what route did you take? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I went through the hole in the Magicant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  goes and sits down at her usual table --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see, I went through the magican't castle, spent what felt like an hour in the space between the two holes, and raced down here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, there's a castle accessable through there??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, copy of Peach's Castle completely in the Magicant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...any luck?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It even has the courtyard!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe that one point of that cave dive the other day wasn't as crazy as I thought. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With a fake sky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, the endless hallway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PK told me about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right before we broke the endless staircase.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and breakable loading screens. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: Sounds like a good place to jog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I haven't mapped everything, but the Tiny Huge Island Paintings kinda... scale the player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, that would make sense...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: PO. Any luck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, that's gotta be annoying for space players. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: No, nothing yet.... getting some interference from the Magicant...</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sorry, it comes with the territory</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There's nothing...She's not on this planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: Didn't you guys see him before?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: Dude was there for like five minutes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...then where the fuck is she?!?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((brb lunch))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Question of the goddamn century...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say we go into the magicant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure we won'tget hopelessly lost down there? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The place she described didn't sound like anywhere in the magicant...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Don't worry, I've been making a map!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...watch that map get inaccurate. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: Rob, isn't there some kinda cave system on your Land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Huh?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...One or two, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But what the hell'd she be doing on /my/ land...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: I'm getting a read from there....not sure if It's interference, or something else....</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ((PO, we actaully found another planet, I think. just letting you know,))</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: ((Okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fd7f2b">[CPO]</span>  presses another button --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets see if we can get a better signal in the magicant itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: ....It's a dud.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah that figures...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...well, I guess we could try. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...But then we're back at square one</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: She's not on LoSaE....FL, why are you so hoping to get into the Magicant?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just... have a feeling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That maybe we could use it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: You know what, let's go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: It's Magicant time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...if it's that diffucult...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: PO, can you limit your search to planets that are a bitch to scan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: Ones with high interference...? I think so, gimme a sec.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The magicant leads to all sorts of places...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fd7f2b">[CPO]</span>  button pressinggggg --</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: It's some planet I've never seen before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: We can probably get to it through the Magicant, but....I don't know what we'll find.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Yeah... but FL, I thought the point was that it's nigh impossbile to get signals out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, the memo works fine in the magicant...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, most of the time. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, It has different spatial geometry... but radio signals and perhaps seeing what signal strength is stronger if we go by the right doors...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...then I have no damn clue,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, lost woods logic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Someone here /has/ played Ocarina of Time, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, /duh/ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You do know what I am talking about, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but how do we know which way to take? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I take it the path doesn't have a slightly different texture or a monkey to follow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: By seeing what path has the strongest signal strength.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: I'm a monkey!</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In OOT, you had to go to the path that had the music playing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thus, we should follow the path with the strongest signal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...lets hurry up with finding the place please?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fd7f2b">CPO: ....TT's connection just closed. We have to hurry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, that weirdo puzzle. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  dives into the wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_Magicant'>#SBARGv2_Magicant</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: The longer we take, the more likely TT ends up dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT perpetuallyOptimistic <span style="color:#fd7f2b">[CPO]</span>  wheee! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CPO</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
