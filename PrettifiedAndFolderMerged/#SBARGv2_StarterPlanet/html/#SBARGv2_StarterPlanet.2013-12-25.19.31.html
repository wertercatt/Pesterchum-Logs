[07:31:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[07:31:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  stumbles a bit --</span><br />
[07:31:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  appears in a flash of flame with EQ. --</span><br />
[07:32:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Bleh... thanks.</span><br />
[07:36:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: funny how this and the transportalizers are the only methods of direct teleportation that don't give me displacement sickness.</span><br />
[07:37:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed...</span><br />
[07:37:52] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I do find it confusing how the whole teleportation-with-fire works, but I doubt I'll really understand it for a long while if at all.</span><br />
[07:38:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well uh, you know how I can steal souls?</span><br />
[07:39:27] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: mhm?</span><br />
[07:40:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, the form the soul naturally takes is a fire.</span><br />
[07:40:24] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Really now?</span><br />
[07:40:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, basically I'm converting our entire bodies into souls and changing the position to a place that is familiar.</span><br />
[07:41:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As places that are well, home, tend to have a closer connection to the soul.</span><br />
[07:42:39] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I... see.</span><br />
[07:42:51] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That is kinda creepy, if I think too much into it...</span><br />
[07:44:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: K.</span><br />
[07:44:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... ANYWAYS, lets head on inside! It's cold out here, and I'm thinking too much about souls...</span><br />
[07:45:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs, heading on inside the bar --</span><br />
