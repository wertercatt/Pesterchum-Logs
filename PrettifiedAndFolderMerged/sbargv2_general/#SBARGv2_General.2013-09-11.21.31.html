<span style="color:#133295">CEP: One of the creepiest parts was when this kid, who was the son of one of the police officers, had this police dog as a pet :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And then the pet transformed into a monster like cerebus :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and it was both really creepy and sad :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: since the dog was so friendly and then it became this horrific monster dog that you had to kill :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: they had a second parasite eve, which I haven't played :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and a third game for the psp, but that was more of a third person shooter :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a good thing to do is to lurk in the incip memo first to get a feel for things and then introduce your char when you're comfortable. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yup :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#60bc0b">CRD: Ok!</span><br />

<span style="color:#60bc0b">CRD: Lurk forever sounds good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Opinion on what? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: oh, speaking of video game ideas :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What if Nathan Drake from Uncharted and Lara Croft from Tomb Raider teamed up? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I dunno why I'm so interested in characters teaming up :&gt;</span><br />
