<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Fine. Later today.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because I could use an adventure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Gods.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think I got some sort of hint.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, it had some messed up security.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I mean no we already know its 2 hours and 15 minutes now no changing that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wound up blocking external signals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What I mean is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm thinking it was made to disrupt communications.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Time travel's funny if you'd just said later today we probably could carried on and done it but as is i just feel real pressure on being locked into its /going/ to happen in such and such</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: It technically is later today. That was just the approximate time current me had when everything started happening.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (you just summed up all the rules of paradox space in one sentence RS)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (thanks, i try)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (time is one of those things i try and understand to the fullest extent if for nothing else, knowing what exactly locks me into a certain path and where there's room for malleability))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, this is why I should avoid asking about the future... but am I going to remember that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Not really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (I have a limited sense of that too, mostly from watching dr who :P)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But anyways, it seems the satilite is projecting some sort of field that blocks communications... like when I was near the su-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  thought he heard someone about to say green sun --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  DID SOMEONE SAY GREEN SUN? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I was going to say surface of the denizens cavern.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  ...felt like someone had to since Kat's not here --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And please stop using the /me command.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  this is OOC --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  you cannot see this --</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  it's ironic. I'm in an ironic mood today :/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys, we aren't playing dungeons and dragons over the memo or anything... are we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, two towers down, and I can see the third tower already. but I'm not going to say "this is going well" since I already know from watching the Prince of Light's lets-plays that tempting fate is to be avoided at all cost</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((headcanon: chuggaaconroy is the Prince of Light since he destroys things (game bosses) with crazy luck))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, didn't you just say the words in the quotes? I think mentioning finagle's law tends to make it take effect...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (my logic is defeated noooooooo)</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: ... I have to abscond. See you later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aw, but you just got here!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMP, ?MP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...CP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You still there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, I'm still here</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: just not talking much since I'm running across my land on this quest</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Don't tell me I ruined everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SHIT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why did I say that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah, I'm good. though there's an ohgodwhat dancing on the third tower...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: An ohgo- you mean a glitch monster?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. imps fused into a freak of paradox space, like a gmod ragdoll poser's worst nightmare</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...what does it look like? Combonation wise?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or is it every prototype?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and now I'm afraid of what the black king is going to look like... after we stop chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's just normal imps, combined voltron-style into a woofing mass the size of an ogre</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats worse then I thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and yeah, our BK is going to be at least 300% uglier than the trolls' king, and THEY had a horrorterror in it</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like from the trickster mode of John's Imp Strife?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: *Horrorterror pet</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the wh-- um, same general idea but a lot more of them</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, it exploded into the component imps after I ran inside and activated the tower</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, so a spawning glitch...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that a teleporter displaces matter normally... but what if two things teleport to the same spot at the EXACT same time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do you /really/ wanna know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because honestly I don't</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like about 5.39106(32) × 10−44 s</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's /not/ do that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats 10^-44, not 10-44.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: from what I've read, that's exactly what causes ohgodwhats. sburb's spawning algo having a seizure and placing multiple underlings in the same coordinates in the same tick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Knew it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so unless we stop chronos and/or our real guardian gets code-fixin', we can expect a hell of a lot more of those things soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And according to the laws of physics, that "tick" should be... about 10^-45 seconds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What the hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Holy fucking shit I forgot about the carapacians</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But anyway, I finally had an honest to goodness dream... I could tell because I couldn't read a newspaper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((actually, ticks as in game logic, or 1/20th of a second. but whatever))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, there are different tick times for different games, like 60 steps per second for the genesis games, or 30 frames per second for most games... yeah. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dammit I really wanna see what would happen if I went through SCP-786 more than once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it says [DATA EXPUNGED]</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I wanna know what would actually happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We should /stop/ with the SCPs</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and besides, the only way you could do it would be to size-reduce twice</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: THERE'S SCP IN THIS SESSION?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: WHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: 786</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'M GETTING RID OF IT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Its like</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS SAFE CLASS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NV!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: that dumb cone that makes things bigger or smaller</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its a funnel, not a cone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's an SCP</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Last time a friend of mine got entangled with SCP he ended up on death row and I had to help bust 'im out</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: In my book SCPs are universally /un/safe class.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm blowing it up the second I see it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, time to hide it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably a wise idea NV. if an alternate me accidentally unleashed motherbarking Cy-Bugs by alchemizing with a Wreck-it Ralph dvd... if we're not careful, we might release 682 into the alpha timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WOOPWOOPWOOPWOOP</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: WE ARE /NOT/ RELEASING 682.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: why couldn't we just</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: IF YOU /DARE/ I WILL FIND YOU, AND I WILL KILL YOU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /not/ do SCPs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because some are actually useful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: nothing you couldn't replicate some other way that's less likely to backfire and more understanded</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why can't you just use a humongifier like everybody else</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: case in point</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know what, I'll get rid of it if you can get me something that will shrink and enlarge objects safer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Humongifier and shrinkifier</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: They are actual additions to the alchemiter</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other wise I'm going to make a penny that always lands heads up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why has nobody added these things yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, cause we have the camera add on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm thinking of the robo bunny eyes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I tricked out the alchemiter in HQ with pretty much everything I could, in addition to a technosmithing station.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably wouldn't be hard to make it an addition on that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I'll make a tiny tardis and scale it up with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm going to beat you up one day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'M GOING TO MAKE SCP-014-J!</span><br />
