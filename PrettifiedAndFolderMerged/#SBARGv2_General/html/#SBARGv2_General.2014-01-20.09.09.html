[06:59:30] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> should lurk in IC to get a feel for the roleplay again</span><br />

[07:00:02] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">once</span> I get a feel for the roleplay enough I could co-GM so that whenever you have problems with feeling pressured to make decisions I can help talk you through it to help stop the drama before it starts by making a clear canon</span><br />
[07:00:27] <span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">because</span> honestly fact is everyone is kind of afraid to add to the roleplay because of FA's triggerhappy shootingdown that happened a while back</span><br />
