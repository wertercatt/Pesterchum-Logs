[04:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: <span style="color:#626262">OF COURSE, THE ONLY REASON THAT WAS EVEN A PROBLEM IS CAMSTUDIO IS A BUTT AND YOU CAN ONLY CAPTURE GAME AUDIO BY TRICKING YOUR COMPUTER AT THE REGISTRY LEVEL INTO TREATING THE SPEAKERS AS A MIC...

[05:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which I probably /could/ do, now that I have a decent desktop...</span><br />
[05:01] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: Or I could take it over</span><br />
[05:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but I'm buried in so many other things to do first :P</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: export it with studio</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: and email it to me</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's definitely a project I still intend to do eventually...</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: and I could take over</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: if you dont want to finish it</span><br />
[05:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and PK, I have a super-old copy of the .rbxl files, but last I checked, game updates had broken LITERALLY ALL THE SCRIPTS.</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: yeah it would be a pain in da ass to get it working</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (most crucially the animation system for the scanners, so you never even get to the part where it teleports you</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: i loved the way frontflip worked</span><br />
[05:03] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: levitation time</span><br />

[05:04] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: you look so silly</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: when I do eventually get around to it, I'll probably use the new terrain system thingy they added soon after my builder's club subscription ran out</span><br />
[05:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((which btw is a prereq to me redoing the project, since free players only have one slot for places last I checked))</span><br />

[05:05] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: did you go by a different name? i was never in the "community" but i might have watched your videos</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: the first like 5 videos on Kimura's channel are roblox</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: slowly quit it when minecraft came around</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: he was WackoMcGoose</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh</span><br />

[05:05] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: for a while</span><br />
[05:05] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: then i got minecraft</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: and I stopped</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: and then i got back to roblox</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#fe7c27">CPO: ((Why is everything red <a href='@_'>@_</a>@))</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: and then I gave up again</span><br />

[05:06] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: ))</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: up until a year ago, wackomcgoose was my handle for pretty much the entire net. I only recently started using creeperPuncher as my default handle for stuff</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((PO wat))</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...hm, might take a look at your mc videos</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: im on "LittleBigRoblox Test Level" now</span><br />
[05:06] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it looks like youre using it as something other than the background to a glorified podcast</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also one of the previews is vvvvvv</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yup, Paper Minecraft actually had a story to it... I just didn't have the right hardware or editing stuff to make it work /correctly/</span><br />
[05:07] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: so it was kinda like Yogscasty</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: minecraft with a story</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug. I... actually haven't watched the yogscast.</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: well they do a minecraft series with a really good storyline</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but my series' original concept was "a PMTTYD-like story in the minecraft world"</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ... episode 2-4</span><br />
[05:08] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: is this literally just</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: playing a vvvvvv custom level</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it switches to MC about halfway through</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: what is "vvvvvvvv:</span><br />
[05:09] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: "</span><br />
[05:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: 2-2 and 2-3 were not-MC at all... in fact, all of Chapter 2 was the "Big Lipped Alligator Episodes" variety...</span><br />
[05:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then it went back to regular stuff in Chapter 3</span><br />
[05:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and in 4 (which I haven't done yet), there'll be other characters and a sane plot :D</span><br />
[05:11] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: alright im moving on to "LittleBigRoblox Test Level Revision 1.5"</span><br />

[05:13] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: in vvvvvv</span><br />
[05:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
[05:13] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: because aside from that gamzee room that just looks stupid</span><br />
[05:14] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats a really good custom level</span><br />
[05:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, the gamzee room was just "<span style="color:#2b0057">AlL ThE MoThErFuCkIn' GrAvItY LiNeS</span></span><span style="color:#ee1e00">"...</span><br />

[05:15] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: resume Paper Minecraft</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the one thing that pisses me off though is the google+ thing, so I can't even comment on MY OWN VIDEOS ANYMORE</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: its not like your doing anything</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and PK, I plan to, as soon as I get a better editing program than shitty powerdirector.</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: we are all just waiting around so this is the perfect time</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like theres real effort here</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: alright what kind of a editting device do you wamts</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: *wantsa</span><br />
[05:16] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: **WANTS GOD DAMN</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I want Vegas, but that's super expensive and I've said repeatedly why I can't torrent it))</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: although i dont really get the chuggaconroy thing because i dont watch him</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#555500">CPK: (( because your for being legal and stuff? ))</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I forgot what that room name was a ref to, actually.</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: STEVE!</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also did you really need to keep in every single "death"</span><br />
[05:17] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like tbh thats a little sloppy</span><br />
[05:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((that, and if Comcast sees any torrenting from our connection OF ANY KIND REGARDLESS OF CONTENT, we'll get throttled and/or d/c'd.))</span><br />
[05:18] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you could have cut most of those</span><br />
[05:18] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually SL, I cut a fair amount of them. obviously not enough, but better than the raw version.</span><br />
[05:19] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well i mean in the minecraft section</span><br />
[05:19] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we didnt need to see every jump into lava</span><br />

[05:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( :D ))</span><br />
[05:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((though I think I found an "unlimited free trial" trick for an earlier version that I'll look into...))</span><br />
[05:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i didnt realize there were any animated blocks in minecraft</span><br />
