<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just slowly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmm... I just had an idea, it's gonna require some bubblewrap....</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: whoa</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: i can fly</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: well</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: floaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: close enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thinking about making my leg a 5 dispenser for my 5 whip technique </span><br />
<span style="color:#c1c108">CGT: What's the 5 whip technique?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: basically, you have to have a bunch of a raw number of your choice, and a matching necklace of that particular number.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I believe it's called a cat's tail</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: with the necklace you can attract the numbers to form a loose whip to slam down, but usually you lose quite a bit of numbers in the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's a good thing the numbers are somewhat cheap to mass-produce.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and by the way, it's litterally a bunch of loose copies of the number 5.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1c108">CGT: Like when sonic looses all his rings in the original games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah kinda like that</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Looks like a lot of 5's.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, the bubblewrap thing has to do with 5 storage. Usually I store them in jars to smash at the enemy first, but I'm thinking maybe I could store them in bubblewrap to cover my prostheticleg with to release them in a quicker manner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1c108">CGT: Sounds vicious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it would lower the damage level, but I think it's a fair trade-off for efficiency.</span><br />
