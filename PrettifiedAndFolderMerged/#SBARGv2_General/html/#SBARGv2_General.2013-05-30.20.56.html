<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  sounds like something out of FFIII</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  o.0</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  looks a teensy bit like it too</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  if the onion knight class wasn't totally chibified</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yeah there is no one like that in berserk expect maybe pandaman\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *except\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and pandaman dies in the first movie\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  but he's guaranteed to be the most awesome character in the entire series</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  because SPHERICAL!~</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ah, Sorry, CS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Heh. Yeah. Onion bro is one of the most aweson charachters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Fs you can't say that you only watched the anime and only part of the anime at that\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: you can't say who is the "best" character. there are points when guts get pretty conficted expestailly if you read the manga.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so, on the way home I scored two bottles of faygo. it's not bad, actually. though the rootbeer flavor is kinda underwhelming</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ah... I meant in Dark Souls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: he can be a very conficted character but your just like "nope his just a brooding swordsman"\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...I've read some of Berserk and Guts is... both simple and complicated.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: But he is so much more than that. he is a sirvivor of childhood abuse, and rape, has lived his entire life only learning how to fight, had to kill his father figure, and watched his best friend rape the woman he loved\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and all that is just backstory\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and pandaman's still better XP</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: oh wait also the same best friend safriced all of his other friends to become a demon, and when the newly demonized best friend raped the woman he loved it corrupted his unborn child\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so his unborn child was demonized\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and on top of all that the love of his live loses her memory after all that happens\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and then Pandaman tumbled out of the grave and ate them all through his mouthless, spherical helmet</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  cuz that's how he ROLLS xP</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: He rolls off a cliff and dies more like it since he fell down in his armor\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  cuz now he can fly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dududuDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  IT'S PANDAMAN!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so no pandaman is a flying demon/angel thing like what happens in another arc of berserk?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *now\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  defender of the true story and what totally actually happened EVERYWHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  no cuz see</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  he's from the timeline that actually happened</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  in my head at least XP</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: too bad pandaman actually dies in the alpha timeline\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  not for me he doesn't</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  pandaman will always live on forever in his sphericality</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well you're going off doomed timeline dave stuff\l/</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: hey, random idea I thought of a while ago: what if video games are like timelines, and every time the player dies and has to reload, he's reverting an ingame doomed timeline?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  well of course you won't find it if you type his name like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: obviously it only works for singleplayer games with saving (or emulator-savestates)</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I'm going straight to the manga chapter\l/</span><br />
