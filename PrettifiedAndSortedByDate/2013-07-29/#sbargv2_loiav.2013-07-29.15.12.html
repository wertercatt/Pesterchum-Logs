The dwelling spire looks like it was once a dwelling spire like any other… but since then, it has been reduced to an empty, burnt-out husk of itself. A bit of lava is seeping from one of the still-standing windows. Everything around the spire-- and indeed, for the entire Land itself-- looks to be flat and made of black velvet.<br />
FA has acquired Bottle of Ink!<br />
Who knows what havoc she can unleash?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[CSE]</span>  sighs and waits for anyone to have jumped down to clear out before he followed down the hole after them. --</span><br />
And down, down, down the rabbit hole SE, PO, and MA go… what will they find? No one knows!<br />
Actually, that's not true. The narration knows.<br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ Lets go find the others /)</span><br />
They find black velvet. A room made of black velvet.<br />
Isn't it beautiful?<br />

It's difficult, but eventually, Raz believes he's at least in the general vicinity, and that's about as good as he's going to get.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  hops off and kicks a flare into the skies above, sighing before carefully walking around as before to find a way below --</span><br />

Well, Raz's /eyes/ say there should be solid ground there…<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  lands nearby and also investigates carefully around the velvet he is walking upon --</span><br />

FS' ground is actually solid ground. Go figure.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  hahaha fuck trusting his eyes. Carefully stepping around as before, taking light steps so he doesn't fall in in the likely case that some ground ends up being  decidedly unsolid --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *sees the flare and follows it down to the others*</span><br />
The ground is decidedly unsolid where Raz and CP are.<br />

The fuck is going on here?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  suddenly grabs his head, hissing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  was following RS the whole time in that flying thing, so they're probably like maybe 20 feet away from each other? --</span><br />

The narration's word is law.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  boggles at this development and activates his umbrellajetpack, hovering over to the area where RS fell through since he would have seen him go through --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  he stepped off into nothing did he not? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  whoops, distracted by the crazy. Prooobably falls. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  now extends a hand through the velvet RS apparently fell through --</span><br />

They are not in the same room.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  to check if it's solid or something --</span><br />
FS' hand goes through. It is not solid. He just saw a guy fall through it, why the fuck would it be solid?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  oh great, the narration likes splitting the party --</span><br />
The narration will admit to being a sadist.<br />
At times.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  figures he should go through as well and zips right down after RS --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks around, what does he see besides velvet? --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *finds where the flare comes from, yet sees no one*</span><br />
FS and RS are now in a black room. CP sees… more velvet… and what looks to be a swarm of dying imps.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  hits the ground with a groan, clutching his chest as he writhes. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  hovers down and draws his rapier --</span><br />
FS and RS see nothing but black vel… er… FS sees nothing but black velvet. Raz appears to be preoccupied.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does not immediately attack the imps, since they seem to be dying anyway, and looks around to get a better sense of the area --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  thought this was the impy room for some reason oops. FS does not draw his rapier then. --</span><br />
That's a good question, MA. The ground is very, very flat all around you. Where could they possibly be?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  lands next to RS --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  but if they jump on him, they take a User's Revenge through the face --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  barks out a noise of irritation, rolling onto his stomach and shakily pushing himself off the ground. --</span><br />
They're all jumping on CP and exploding into grist nearly at once like Disneyfied lemmings. Self-preservation instinct? What self-preservation instinct?<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  where's this anger coming from. As long as he's got a direction to go in he can deal with it. --</span><br />
What Raz feels is only growing stronger.<br />
Where /is/ it coming from?<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *does that bark of irritation reach the outside, or does it dissipate before reaching the outside?*</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ... are you quite alright RS?</span><br />
Well, it was /quite/ a long fall…<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /fine/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of walks through the sudokucidal imp pile, Grist Magnet passively sucking in the loot, and heads toward the other end of the room/hallway/thing --</span><br />
The ground does not seem to be there partway across CP's room.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  spits out the word, taking a shaky step forward, then a not-so-shaky step. --</span><br />
No, MA did not hear anything, but he could possibly message someone.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  welp, another noncollideable tile. faaaaaaaalling again --</span><br />
CP may want to learn to walk more carefully. Nevertheless, he lands in a pit of black velvet. Why is everything so /dark/ here?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  winces a bit at his movements, but shrugs as he regains his footing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  take out The Fool and shifts it into a board, a swing of the hand calling a miniature raincloud to traverse the room, eyes attentive to where or not the rain starts going through the floor in any spots. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws a mini Sunrise to light the area. visible skybox requirement? Unbounded Canvas Badge, bipches --</span><br />
The rain does, in fact, fall through the floor in three places. If he can see well enough, midway through the room there also appear to be clawmarks on the wall.<br />
CP sees a hell of a lot of black velvet and a straggly serpent-thing making its slow and painful way towards him.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...c'mon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws Icestorm and just sort of puts the serpent out of its misery. why are all the underlings in here /at like 1HP/? --</span><br />
Well, has CP ever heard of LOIAV before? Does he recognise a Player's name that goes with it?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  transforms the board into Belial's Wingman, hopping on to hover across the road and feel the wall aroudn the claw marks. --</span><br />
… the serpent is, however, easily put out of its misery.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *starts feeling around for any holes in the ground in a 2 yard radius about him, starting right where the flare had come from*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  lifts up with the umbrellajetpack again and observes the clawmarks as well --</span><br />
MA quickly manages to (surprisingly enough) discover a hole.<br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: it appears she has been through here...</span><br />
The wall seems solid. Solid and clawed up like some sort of scratching post. For a very large and angry cat.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has heard the landcronym before, but this is his first visit here and doesn't know whose land it is --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... Let's hope this is the one he fell into... *hops into the hole, then activates his rocketshoes before falling too far*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also I feel around for more nocollideables --</span><br />
Then he knows nothing. The pit seems to be just that. A pit. Why's there a pit in the middle of the bloody ground?<br />
MA goes down, down, down… if he so desires, that is.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats down the closest hole in the ground, then. --</span><br />
Eventually, he may see RS and FS.<br />
Raz finds nothing. Except a hole in the ground. A big fucking hole in the ground.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( fffs brb, auto-pilot him finding them and tagging along pls ))</span><br />
Raz and FS see MA. MA sees them. They are all one big happy family.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  did I find anything yet? --</span><br />
You found a pit in the ground, CP.<br />
There does not appear to be anything down there.<br />
Perhaps it was a trap designed to catch those who could not see through the void.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has a zipboard, and also Cherry Bombs. and velvet is probably soft enough to blow holes in. so I try that --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ((yaaaaaaaay))</span><br />
CP is now bombing the pit. He is able to bomb the pit. The pit is bombed.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  should've specified, he bombs the /walls/ around where the serpent was --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats back up. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats down another pit. --</span><br />
… The walls are also bombed. It looks like this really was just a pit trap.<br />
Raz finds nothing. Not even a monster. But he only checked /one/ bit of the walls, didn't he...?<br />
What's FS doing through all this?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  presumably following RS cuz gotta keep the party together and stoofs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  a burst of fire runs up from the pit RS went into. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  turns around and zipboards outy, back through a lot of shitty repeated-texture noncollideable velvet terrain tiles to the surface, then down through where he saw RS fall earlier --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  an instant before it burns FS the stuff turns white, luckily for him. --</span><br />
FS may want to not follow RS too closely. There were zombie rats last time...<br />
CP manages to find the rest of the party!<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  blinks like HOLY SHIT --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  motherbarking /finally/ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, hey guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  decides following RS may not be as good an idea --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies back up, clutching his chest. Hair shadows his eyes as he just floats there, trembling faintly --</span><br />
CP is in a black, wet room with clawmarks on one of the walls and three apparent pits in the floor.<br />
It contains Raz, FS, and MA.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: check the /walls/...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  blinks wide eyed, then turns to CP --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: oh... hello kimura</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: apparently, I fell down a fake alternate path</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: just... nearly got incinerated...</span><br />
It's true. He did.<br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: not a terribly huge deal</span><br />
… That applies to both statements.<br />
So, what's everyone up to now?<br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: good to have you back with us then</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: find anything yet? besides super deudly fire pits?</span><br />
Super deudly Raz pits, maybe...<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /WHAT PART OF CHECK THE FUCKING WALLS DID YOU MISS/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  explodes in fire, the stuff wreathing him in a flash. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  cherry-bombs the fucking walls --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  shrugs before checking the wall with the clawmarks again --</span><br />
One of CP's bombs does not blast a hole in anything.<br />
It seems there was already a hole there.<br />
Hmm...<br />
It's not particularly near the clawmarks, though...<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  investigates the pre-existing hole --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
His investigative body part goes right through the fucking wall.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  eyebrowraises --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater's <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS'S]</span>  flames die down, turning white before fading completely. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  follows his heart in the most unironic manner possible, hoping the charm leads through that hole and closer to AG --</span><br />
Raz is definitively able to go through the fucking wall.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows RS through the fucking wall --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  keeps hovering about, eventually gliding over to where the rest had gone through --</span><br />
Well, the four of them are in another black velvet room, albeit one that looks like something set it the hell on fire and watched it burn.<br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  but I only just got here <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is it still on fire though, or just charred? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: it seems that we are on the right track</span><br />
It's charred as hell. The fire looks /recent/, yes… but either the fire went out or something forcibly put it out.<br />
The room also bears signs of a small tornado, so...<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  okay good, I don't have to use Galestorm then... because something apparently already did... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies over to the far wall and taps along...Okay calling what he's doing tapping is like calling a hurricane a small weather system. Punching the wall to see if it's solid. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  hooray for nonviolent ways of working off aggression! --</span><br />
The wall is solid. Also very soft. Mm, feel the velvet...<br />
But that's just one wall, of course.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( back ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies over to the next, punching it in turn. Fuck walls. Always trying to stop you from /going/ places. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  umbrellajetpacks over to one of the other walls of the room, running his hands along the velvet as he goes by --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  feels along the other wall that no one's trying yet --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *tries feeling along the ceiling instead*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks shere he is, as he zoned out. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where*</span><br />
Raz eventually manages to punch a hole through the wall… oh wait… that was already ther<br />
*there.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: got it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: come on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: excellent</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies through the wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  follows RS through the hole in the wall --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Faster, faster...!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is so angry he's urging the narration to go faster. Or is he just trying to get to AG faster? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  the world may never know --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *follows as well*</span><br />
The narration ignores him. /Fuck/ him.<br />
The next room looks like some sort of arena made entirely out of black velvet.<br />
It's exactly the sort of place one would expect to find a boss-type monster ready and waiting to murder them the moment they stepped onto the floor-- why is the floor covered in lava...?<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Is FL with CP? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  has been on his zipboard for a bit now. fuck lava. --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  is glad he was hovering on his umbrellajetpack --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also, I'm with RS and FS --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  idk where you and Ash are --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( ash is apparently tagging along? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I figure they would have stuck with FS and CP? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Yeah im here just hella distracted))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: ((Family being a bunch of Needy cunts))</span><br />
If one were to look past the lava, it would look like something tore the fuck out of the floor. However, there is lava everywhere, so...<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is floating as well, hooray floating. Hoverboards fuck yeah --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is using his jet wings --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... *he can't even muster a reaction to all the lava on the ground*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is the lava floating through the hole in the floor down somewhere? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, think you can cool down that lava?</span><br />
No… it just looks like there's a… oh, wait, no, there is a hole.<br />
There is also lava flowing down into that hole.<br />
A different hole than the clawmarks, perhaps, and over near one of the corners...<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: got a water source to draw the Waterspout from? I don't have a water bucket with me...</span><br />
Then again, there's what looks to be the site of an explosion in the ceiling, so who knows.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  and because of minecraft logic, summoning rain with Deluge won't cool the lava --</span><br />
Not if it's magic.<br />
But what is this "minecraft logic" you speak of here?<br />
You fell down the rabbit hole, dear.<br />
You're in Wonderland now.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, the human body is mostly water...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I do have this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
FL's is certainly a great idea.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a water bottle. --</span><br />
The narration recommends it.<br />
It would make the narration laugh.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, close enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  twists open the lid. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  fuck it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  brings up the Brush Pad and, upon confirming it detects the water bottle as a water source, scribbles a Waterspout over all the lava --</span><br />
The narration liked the human water source idea better… it's quite possibly pouting now.<br />
And now there is wet, rapidly cooling into lava rock, lava.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also yeah, minecraft logic hardly ever applies when the narration is crazy --</span><br />
The narration prefers the term "sanity-challenged".<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, a few more moments, then with the lack of heat radiation, we should be able to walk on the rock.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  flies over to the far wall and feels along it to see if it's solid or not --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Now then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, try and write on all the walls of this room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does so, even though brush ink texture isn't affected by noncollideability --</span><br />
CP leaves pretty drawings everywhere and Raz's fist does not sink through.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  actually, he should just stop trying to logic... even though as a Light Player, knowledge about stuff is his Thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There needs to be a fake wall...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  checks the other walls in turn expecting them to be solid but not content with expectations --</span><br />
They are...<br />
...<br />
Solid.<br />
Yup.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I so need to make spray paint bombs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  flies over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks down... --</span><br />
FL sees a floor and a lava-filled hole.<br />
Actually, it's a lava-filled floor, too.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( what about waterspout? ))</span><br />
The narration did not say it was liquid lava.<br />
The narration just forgot the word for hard lava.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Touche. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((pfft))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ROCK. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...wait if we are underground isn't it Magma? ))</span><br />
… The narration politely requests that FL go fuck himself, and then beats his rock with paper.<br />
No, it's lava. The narration never said the lava was meant to be there, now did it?<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lizard. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also on the topic: is a lava pit at the bottom of a mineshaft too cliche?))</span><br />
Come on now, folks. Why is there lava?<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lizard eats paper. ))</span><br />
No. I'll /make/ you a lava pit if you want.<br />
Scissors. We're now lesbians.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Spock. ))</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( i don't even. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  detects the magical parenthesis aliens again --</span><br />
Paper again.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  does not know how much more of this he can take --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Nuke. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( /me just sort of walks out of the argument between FL and the narration ))</span><br />
Void.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( TRY RPS-101</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ))</span><br />
The narration narrates itself winning.<br />
The narration has now won.<br />
Because the narration /always/ wins.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has lost. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((MY RAGE TRANSCENDS THE FOURTH WALL AND DEMANDS YOU CEASE THIS TOMFOOLERY))</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  PUNTS EVERYTHING BACK TO IC --</span><br />
The narration also invites Raz to go fuck himself.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also FL, haven't you ever watched George of the Jungle? (the live-action movies, I mean.) it's a bad idea to argue with the narrator))</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks at the shaft. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  does he now~ --</span><br />
Wait.<br />
What shaft?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The hole? --</span><br />

Er, FL. The hole is filled with hard lava.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is going as far as he can anyways. --</span><br />
FL gets two inches below floor level.<br />

FL breaks through the hard lava… into the hot liquid lava.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
The liquid lava looks to be slowly draining out of the hole, though.<br />
After all, its source was turned into obsidian and cobblestone.<br />

It seems that that rambunctious skater has forgotten the properties of the lava from his own land! How could he fly through the lava when it nullifies Aspect-related abilities as well as magic-based abilities?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  Psycho Burgundy entails burning the user's soul as fuel for insanely hot and powerful flames. --</span><br />

That would be sad, would it not?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  is there anything on the other side of the lava to fly through? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm. I just realized something... it only nullifies aspects and magic, but not tech...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, no. not trying it unless I have to.</span><br />
The only thing one would find on the other side of that pool of lava is more lava.<br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  bursts out from the pool of lava still on fire, spinning in place. The flames around him turn white as he clutches his chest, gnashing his teeth harder still. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Forget the lava for now...!</span><br />
Raz has actually managed to survive the lava…?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  may or may not have to give a crash course on how exactly this stuff works, either OOCly or ICly. --</span><br />
If anyone were to somehow make it down through the hole filled with lava, they would find themselves-- shut up Raz-- in a lava stream.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( that would have been a good idea when you INTRODUCED IT ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Fine then, he dies and everyone goes back mourning for him and Gambit... And a bunch of people get upset OOC. ))</span><br />
And if they managed to fly out of that, they would find themselves in a black velvet room.<br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (( actually that is /exactly/ what I did))</span><br />

 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: (( bleh let's save this for later then ))</span><br />
Stop fighting or there will be biting.<br />
The narration's comment on "he managed to survive the lava" implies he is not dead.<br />
The narration assumes Raz knows what he's doing with artefacts from his own Land.<br />
If he does not, it does not care.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((hooray...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />

Incidentally, the lava is still slowly dripping down the hole.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((as for the plot thing  the plot is slow, stagnent and vaguely related to the RP with any of the actual players, and I seem to spend way too much time watching what the others are doing and not enough time working on the back end, and generally a lot of people are dissatisfied.   CRS: Like I said, the lava's not insanely hot to the degree that we'll die from close contact, but it's got some weird properties &lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">all its own, not all of which I admit to understanding.  CRS: 'Course Krin's right, it's still pretty hot. Light clothes'll probably be best... long as you're not walkin' around in a suit of armor you'll probably be alright.  CRS: Just from cursory examination it's got a strange kind of magic feel to it...Magic lava? Yeah as if it weren't bad enough. CRS: Just bein' lava, y'know?  CRS: Probably, ehehe. It's pretty</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">cool but its still a pot, and its still lava CRS: Seems like it smothers other magic, fizzles it out. Highlander, ether edition. The effect varies; these rivers only have it in small amounts, the likes of which can be overcome with enough raw magic.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  sees what the narration did there --</span><br />

 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Rob?!</span><br />
Some of it might be blood. Are you really going to check? There's a pocket computer resting in one corner, though, screen set to sleep mode but glowing faintly nonetheless.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...that cannot be good</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  ...everyone was kind of underground. --</span><br />
There are no large objects on the Land's surface. It is completely flat and made of black velvet. There is also no traceable human activity.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  ^ yeah that --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gargantuanAnnihalator <span style="color:#008282">[CGA]</span>  nevermind, okay let me think here --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( GA, kindly don't think. Kindly go away. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT gargantuanAnnihalator <span style="color:#008282">[CGA]</span>  okay okay, sorry, seriously sorry --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CGA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
The only evident features about the room are the whatever it's soaked with, the random progressively-deeper clawmarks, and the pocket computer.<br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...</span><br />
This far underground on LOIAV, communications with the outside world have been rendered impossible. All messages will show up blank, all voice-comms white noise, all video feeds nothing but static. The party is now nearly untraceable.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  walks over to the computer, checking it with a feeling he knows exactly what and whose it is. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  flies up near where the clawmarks are and traces a hand along the whatever-covered velvet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DT, do you copy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh hell.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  shrugs and picks up the computer. --</span><br />
The velvet seems to sting him a little as he touches it. Perhaps an effect of whatever is soaking it. The computer, however, wakes itself up when Raz approaches.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  blinks at the computer. --</span><br />
This is what appears on the computer's screen: <a href='http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9477r0ffj1qz7x00o1_500.jpg'>http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9477r0ffj1qz7x00o1_500.jpg</a><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...CP, can you read that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  withdraws his ungloved hand abruptly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((sorry, had to afk. catching up real quick...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...more of that ink...</span><br />
A soft semi-mechanical female voice issues forth from the speakers.<br />
AE: Hello.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *looks over the screen*</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... Alice?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Alice.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah, I'm FL.</span><br />
AE: Oh, and FS.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Yes.</span><br />
AE: How nice to see you all here.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why are you down here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  flies over to the computer --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess thats a better question.</span><br />
AE: My partner left me here after she said my voice annoyed her too greatly-- at least, I believe that is what was said.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:/</span><br />
AE: It was getting rather difficult to tell by that point.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: She's further in, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: mm...</span><br />

AE: This dungeon has already been cleared once.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... I would not fault her for saying that, in the state she was likely in...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: thank goodness she is still here then...</span><br />
AE: Its schtick? A monster fight of ever-increasing difficulty, one per room.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I see.</span><br />

AE: Spoilers.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...No fun.</span><br />
The girl smiles.<br />
AE: Oh my. This must be the… "no fun" police, then?<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh shut up River Song.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do you want to hitch a ride? My COMP's got more then enough space for it.</span><br />
AE: I would prefer you catch up to my partner before she reaches the final room.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Should we just blow our way through?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d004b">CFS: ...did you happen to see where she went then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And use portable holes and such?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Catch up. Can do.</span><br />
AE: And that would be nice, Raz. Yes. She went through the exit.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  motions to the device on his arm, <a href='http://images.wikia.com/megamitensei/images/9/9f/COMPSMTIV.jpg'>http://images.wikia.com/megamitensei/images/9/9f/COMPSMTIV.jpg</a> . Extends a USB cable from the thing and plugs it into the computer. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay.</span><br />
The girl transfers herself over onto the device, leaving the pocket computer void.<br />
AE: And… if at all possible, please do not destroy this Land. Not here.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Of course.</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... *captchas the pocket computer*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads for the exit. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  hovers over to the exit as well --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *follows after*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows, on autopilot since his author is eating pizza and doesn't want goop on his keyboard --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  behinds to check his stock of items... MISC Adventure Gear, Check. Anti Anti Magic Field generator, check. Portable Hole x3, check. Antimatter Capsules x20... check, but he aint pulling it out. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think we are all set.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  runs after. --</span><br />
The girl has pointed out the exit (on one of the walls), and watched the party troop through. The sounds of screaming can now be heard faintly in the distance.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  starts running ahead now. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We better move faster.</span><br />
They find themselves in another room, one that bears no visible signs of damage.<br />
Or anything else.<br />
How many rooms can there even /be/...?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks for the next exit. --</span><br />
Beautiful black velvet.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: God damn, how much more...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  ignores the velvet and zooms around the room. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // With a hand on the wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // SO MUCH STATIC. --</span><br />
The narration is inclined to agree. The velvet is hard to ignore, though. It's what the room is made of. And interestingly enough, FL's hand sinks through said wall very, very close to where they came in.<br />
It might have even been the same hole.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks the hole anyway. --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Hm?</span><br />
It's certainly a hole. A hole that goes forward into a passageway… and just /stops/.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
Although the wall does feel suspiciously bumpy...<br />
Are those… /rungs/?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  goes into the passageway. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets see... do I... climb?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tries to head up from the end of the passageway. --</span><br />
It certainly seems possible.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *pokes his head into the hole*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Try to keep up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  climbs. --</span><br />
There is blackness. Light actually doesn't seem to work in this hole.<br />
But nevertheless, there is blackness and climbing.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Uh... okay. *climbs after them*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is climbing... climbing... --</span><br />
Until they emerge in a room that's not made of black velvet, but metal bars.<br />
And the metal bars are right in front of them.<br />
They seem to be some sort of maze.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fuck this.</span><br />
Hang on, FL.<br />
Sit. Stay.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  preforms a spin attack, attempting to slice the bars. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  clutches the charm around his neck to make sure they're going the right way --</span><br />
As the narration was /going to say/, many of the metal bars look bent, twisted, or outright broken in a path leading to the centre.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Uh...</span><br />
Blood is on the ends of many of the bars.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: heh</span><br />
The spin attack works, though.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  goes straight ahead, following the path. --</span><br />
Most of the bars have been smashed into jagged points or shoved out of the way… and either way, /ow/.<br />
Whoever came through here sure didn't care.<br />
FL does successfully make it through. The narration is proud.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, next area.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  follows the trail of destruction, expression stark --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  checks the ceiling and floor of the center. --</span><br />
He's in the centre. More blood is on the ground.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  follows along as well, his expression grim --</span><br />
There's no exit on either the ceiling or floor.<br />
But also no more broken metal bars.<br />
The bars don't seem to be in a maze anymore, though...<br />
Just in a circle around a makeshift arena.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...This just screams "trap" to me.</span><br />
Was the maze only to get /in/?<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stops his authorial-afk zoneout in time to look around at the very obvious trap --</span><br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...</span><br />
Something has obviously been through here. Said something is no longer here. So where did it /go/?<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See the invisible...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  activates GOGGLES OF TRUE SEEING emulation mode on his shades. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  taps his glasses, shifting on Lens of Truth functionality on. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: GAMBIT!!!!!</span><br />
And before FL and Raz, a path opens clear as day. Part of the bar cage… was not real?<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads to the gap. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We totally need to pack more goggles or lenses.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  clutches the charm, is this the right way? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, definitely...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  walks toward the gap in the bars, looking to see if some part of the floor is fake or if there's anything noteworthy in the area --</span><br />
He is able to get through the gap. It looks to be a straight path forward, but the floor also does not look quite there… not quite there /at all/...<br />
Uh. Who replaced the floor with a pit of spikes?<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Watch the ground. It's fake and opens into a spike trap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  starts floating, fuck yeah Spark Regalia. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gets back on the zipboard --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  floats, no, flies forward --</span><br />
Floating is in no way against the rules. Nor is flying.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  just follows on the umbrellajetpack because it seems like the sensible thing to do --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is using his jet wings. --</span><br />
Sensible. Yes. Very.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  senses the narrator is trying to say "trap" --</span><br />
They fly forwards.<br />
The narration knows how to say trap.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
CP's narrator-senses need work.<br />
 <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA:  *follows along on his rocketshoes as he had been the entire time*</span><br />
What do they find when they fly?<br />
A zombie rat.<br />
No, just kidding.<br />
The zombie rat was dismembered ages ago.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  would have sliced up the rat. --</span><br />
They instead feel a burgeoning sense of heat.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More lava?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GREAT.</span><br />
It's getting hot in here, that's for sure...<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: for crying out loud, enough of this stuff already...</span><br />
The next room they emerge into would be entirely on fire.<br />
No lava, however.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
Just as if a miniature sun ignited half the room.<br />
And then the fire spread.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  examines the fire. --</span><br />
It seems to be regular fire. But it is regular fire on absolutely everything except one part of the far wall, where there is no fire or anything whatsoever.<br />
However, there is a /lot/ of fire.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  draws Galestorm to blow the fire out --</span><br />
Never mind.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  heads to the part of the far wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads over to that part of the far wall, feeling it with his hand --</span><br />
The charred, smoking room allows them to pass. So pass they do. Pass right through the wall.<br />
Goddamn, is this what it feels like to be a Voider who can go through whatever walls she wants?<br />
Fuck you, walls!<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  indeed. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just keeps looking with the goggle mode. --</span><br />
Everything is black. Like, even the bit of the floor that isn't there is black. Because the passageway is made of black velvet.<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  wait there was screaming? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks now, obviously with some light now. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  hovers over to Rob. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fierySwallow <span style="color:#2d004b">[CFS]</span>  blinks as RS falls through --</span><br />

There's no one in sight, though.<br />

It was not necessary. The path is outlined with an obsidian archway this time.<br />
They enter it to see what looks like a quest bed.<br />
A quest bed marked with the symbol of Void.<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: um...</span><br />
You hear a scream as AG phases into existence, glowing so darkly red that it looks like she is not really there herself, and lunges for CP first with claws bared and dripping blood.<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GAMBIT!</span><br />
