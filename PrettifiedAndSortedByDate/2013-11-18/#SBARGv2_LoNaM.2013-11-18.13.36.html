<span style="color:#ebca0e">CBG: door's open!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT brightGriffinsprite <span style="color:#ebca0e">[CBG]</span>  is floating around, looking cheerful and bright for once, light settling on a warm glow and nothing blinding. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  appears out of nowhere by MP's spire, crouched atop a hoverboard, then-- yay open door!-- goes right on in. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  teleports in like yolo. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: YO WHAT'S GOOD</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  smiles and nods to BG, kicking the board into his hands and tucking it over his shoulder before heading on it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  instinctively punches NV in the face --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  follows the group --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ... Cake. It is delicious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: THE FUoh it's just you Nico.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT brightGriffinsprite <span style="color:#ebca0e">[CBG]</span>  giggles and claps her hands --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  instinctively dodges and GUT PUNCHES. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK PUTA</span><br />
<span style="color:#ebca0e">CBG: she's downstairs in the basement! </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT brightGriffinsprite <span style="color:#ebca0e">[CBG]</span>  waves generally for them to follow her as she floats inside the house. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's not strange at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ebca0e">CBG: her workshop's down there...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ebca0e">CBG: so i really can't help where she puts it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  makes her way down towards the stairs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  cuts the identity of Nico's dodge thus nullifying the action. Everything carries on as before and Nico is punch in the face --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  master of dodge my /ass/ ya filthy hypocrite --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  It's a pretty nice house, a little bit cluttered. You smell spaghetti with tomato sauce, and since the basement doors are right across from the kitchen, you see pretty much the stove on with the food cooking. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Basement's not an odd place for a workshop truthfully...Wonder what kind of space she's dealin' with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  *you smell pancakes with maple syrup --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  No. That was cinnamon pancakes with syrup because guess what asshat that's good. For breakfast. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  yeah of course --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((why did I read that as purple syrup))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Who has spaghetti running for a party</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: People who like spaghetti?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ebca0e">CBG: not here, because no party here, just lunch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ebca0e">CBG: speaking of, once you talk to her, tell her it's ready, gosh!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  makes her way downstairs to what is hopefully the basement --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  chuckles, nodding before heading downstairs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yo, Fi! Food's ready too</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  follows them. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  It's a short flight, nothing too fancy. First room to the left's shut closed, and as you turn and head down the second set of stairs you hear the sound of music playing. There's another door lto your left, locked it seems if you tried to open it (and voidproofed, this whole area really). --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  Walk down the hallway and pretty much turns into a kind of fancy workshop and weapons storage place, it's a bit (lot) of a mess in here. Blueprints, tools, weapons stacked on the wall, books and papers, and a large speaker system to the side playing something bass-heavy as she works at the desk to your right. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  is dressed casually in jeans and t-shirt, fiddling with something in her hands. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads down the second set of stairs and then down the hall, expression lightening as he heads further in and the workshop becomes apparent. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Hey hey, Niki. </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Dang girl...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: When I get into something, it's all or nothing Rob.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  shrugs and smiles, kicking her legs idly before hopping to her feet. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Good way to be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Plus it's also kiiiiind of an armory and training room for myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mmhm, I get that. Just didn't realize you were this much of a tinkerer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  Note that there's an alchimeter and other alchemy stuff shoved in here, taking up quite a bit of space. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I dabble, mostly messing with alchimeter shit and then working from there. </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I know just enough to get me by, more than enough about alchemy to work with it and frankly I love the quality of music down here. ANYWAYS! </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  claps her hands eagerly, motioning for Niki to come over. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Rob, Gambit, Envy, hand over your charms for a sec!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  walks forwards --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...I have no idea what's going on. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  hands over some...charm, whatever it is, having followed whoever down to the werever. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  reaches into her shirt to grab the chain of her necklace and get the card charm off, tossing it over at MP's head. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  so much attention in your answer Nico. Catches the card easy, flipping it to its standard mode and breaking it open. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  reches down his shirt and pulls out the familiar Heart charm, taking it off to hand to MP with a quirked brow. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh shit I forgot I fried your charm in Hel's dungeon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Should've fixed that, my bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  i'm pretty sure it was another core drill whoops --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  it was a drill charm yup --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I kept it on anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Works barely at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It was still a present either way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Niki, I've got something for you and KitKat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's up? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  brings out a small hat charm, detailed and if you held it up to the light, looks like a rainbow. or a... spectrum. <img src='../smilies/pccool.png' alt=':cool:' title=':cool:' /> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Are those going to have the findy-thing and if so is it linked to mine?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: No, different frequency.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I can tune yours so it'll be linked but I doubt you want it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sweet. And no I so do not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa, that thing's cool ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Great. Anyways, it's a little charm you can contact me or Rob or whoever else with, but mostly us two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  as she says this, fiddles with the Heart charm, rewiring and grabbing a little chip on the table, inserting it into the casing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  starts cracking up --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Holy shit wow Rob don't even with you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  grins widely, snickering. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  has her cat-top down, laughing so much --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  snickers into his fist, shoving his other hand in his pocket. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  is giggling softly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Sorry sorry distracted. Anyways, Niki, hat charm, you can contact us pretty much anywhere, anytime with this, just say our names or handles if you wanna find us. Spectrum's the name for the team frequency. </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thanks. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Click once and say the name and shit. Real fun's when you double click.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: gotcha. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Seriously, double click, I wanna see if I gotta revise and shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I forgot, do I have it yet or are you still holding onto it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  pauses, looks down at the Heart charm in her hands, and then sort of mutters something before transforming it into a little skateboard instead. Grins like a ten year old. Also hands Niki her charm whoops. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  puts on the charm, tucking it behind her shirt with her sprite pendant --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  snaps the board charm shut and tosses it over to Rob, going to fiddle with Gambit's charm quickly to refix and then hand it back as well. Does the same thing to NV's, except changes it to the numbers 101 over a DNA strip before throwing it back to him. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Your charm when pressed twice turns into a... well, could you pass me that back please, I gotta show you because that is just /sick/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT apocalypseGambit <span style="color:#7ccfb2">[CAG]</span>  beams and clips the charm back to her necklace, looking pleased that it's working again. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  catches it, looking it over with a space-y smile. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Who's, Rob's?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Nope, Niki's.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  takes off the thing and hands it back to MP for a moment --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  catches the charm, eyebrow raising as he looks it over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  grins like a little kid as she double clicks, immediately tossing the thing into the air as out pops a disc with red lines that seems vaguely reminiscent of Tron, though it's much thicker and there's one section where the lines fall off from the design, and another smaller section glowing red. She immediately catches it in her hands and pulls it apart, revealing two thin discs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You need a lot more gear than your leg, so why not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh, that's pretty cool. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Gets better. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  motions for her to follow as she kicks a button on the wall with her heel, having the main wall full of weapons pull away entirely and reveal a shooting range. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  Or something like that. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  follows and, wow --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: K, so! Click this little button here, wrap your hands around here, point this end at one of the targets, and when you're ready squeeze.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  gestures, wrapping her hand around the unlit section and showing a button on the edge for the thumb. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  confusedly manages to hold onto it correctly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  attempts to aim for one of the target thingies with the thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  points the glowing red section at one of the targets, smiling still as she presses the thumb button, having the disc elongate slightly and narrow towards the glowing red end of it, kind of shaped like a sideways V. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  then tightens her grip around the unlit section entirely, showing the entire giant button there, and everyone hears a small high-pitched screech before a laser literally shoots out of the glowing red end, hitting at the center of the target she's pointing at and burning right through it. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: And that is your demo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: cool. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  gently helps Niki adjust her grip to be more firm and nodding at her aim, gives her the all clear to shoot. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  points at the target with the thing and squeases the thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  pew! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  whistles --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  She would hear the same pitched screech before the laser fires, the beam hitting exactly where she wanted it to go. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: awesome! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Also this works well with Time powers, so if you need to amplify with, these are yours to totally work with.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … That is hella cool, Fi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: This is what looking up Tron, needing a gift idea and loving the idea of lasers does.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so... how do I change this thing back? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Click the thumb button again, it's like the safety of a gun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  clicks the thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  it turns back into good ol' disc mode. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Also all your charms can contact each other save Gambit's since she doesn't want to tune into Spectrum's frequency, Gambit if Niki and Kat contact Exseize's you /will/ hear them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Can they track me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Rob has track enabled on his because leader.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I have it as well because master charm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I don't care for tracking anyways so take it up with Rob.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Do I still have it in regards to Exseize? And is it possible to contact Exseize /without/ talking to the other two?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Lovely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yes, Exseize's and Spectrum's frequencies are different so you're autotuned to Exseize, and Niki and Kat's are auto-tuned to Spectrum, mine I hear both if you call team names.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Any other questions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: And the two frequencies won't interact by the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okie-dokie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Unless you deliberately tune and call the other frequency.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: So yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Niki, I have Kat's charm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Could you give it to her if you have the chance?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think so. ➜</span><br />
