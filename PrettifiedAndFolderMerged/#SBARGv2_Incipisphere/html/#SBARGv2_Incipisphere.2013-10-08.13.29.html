<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: never felt a reason to replace it ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh, looks like pokemon emerald is still in the gba slot. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I went through two DS Lites because the first one ended up with a cracked hinge after like three-ish years of use...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, there's your problem there. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why the heck do the trees in the background during the intro flash bluish-green and yellowish-green? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even when the paralax stops moving at the last couple of seconds ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaaaand, the clock battery has ran dry. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Holy jeez I have a really old blue DS, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sucessful rocket launch 9999 ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess it defaults to that when the battery kicks it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: rocket launch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's a thing in hoenn where it pretty much acts as a week counter ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and there's no way in heck that it's actually been 9999 weeks since I started that game. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: ono</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: as much as I want to blame my time powers on this, I'm pretty sure it was natural causes based on neglect that caused the internal clock battery's downfall. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ..oh come ON, I made kecleon an HM slave with no special attacks whatsoever? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn it, I forgot, this game doesn't have a way to "do nothing" like some of the other pokemon games have. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *1st gen and the remakes had the pokeflute, which can sucessfully waste a turn, and 5th gen has trying to use a temp stat booster on a pokemon that's not being used to waste a turn ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: &gt;^&lt;====the more you know ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and as soon as I switch to pikablu the azumarill, it finally uses curse a second time... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...and somehow it has 1 hp left??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does that usually happen? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and on that bombshell, goodnight everybody.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: goodnight Kim ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: goodnighτ..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((anyway CS, so tomorrow's dungeon won't be until the afternoon right?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
