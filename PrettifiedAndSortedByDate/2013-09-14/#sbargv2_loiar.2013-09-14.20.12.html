<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT dubiousLarcenist <span style="color:#809da9">[CDL]</span>  is singing softly to herself under her breath as she jumps to the side almost before he throws the knives, her harpy fluttering its wings. She pulls her keychain back before whipping it at Byron again. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lostKnight <span style="color:#12075b">[CLK]</span>  braces himself, allowing the chain to bounce harmlessly off of his armor, then leaps towards his opponent. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT lostKnight <span style="color:#12075b">[CLK]</span>  goes for a stab, then darts away from the wall --</span><br />
