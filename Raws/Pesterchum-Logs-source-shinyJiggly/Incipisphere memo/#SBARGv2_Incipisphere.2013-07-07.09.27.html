<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: woah woah woah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: AM</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ yes? ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: do you remember being adam from metroid then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ Sort of. ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: jeeze</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that must be a little rough</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ My knowledge only extends to what is revealed inthe games ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE:  <a href='@_'>@_</a>@</span><br />
AE: … You are not even your own...<br />
AE: Never mind.<br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ Ash is not the most original person on the planet ]</span><br />
AE: One could come to that conclusion.<br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ As for it being Rough ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ I suppose it is but I have long since stored that knowledge away in favor of dedicating my process to more constructive methods ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: still</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: must feel a little... i dont know</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: like youre out of place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ It does, yes ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sorry about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ono</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ But constantly keeping a tab on Ash sort of... 'fills the void' I suppose ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ No need to be sorry. ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i know</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: just it would kinda suck to be put into that situation</span><br />
AE: I agree.<br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ It is a bit uncomfortable, Yes. ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ but I enjoy the tasks given to me ]</span><br />
AE: Were you created only to work?<br />
AE: Is that why an AI system comes into being? Because someone has a task that needs to be done?<br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dunno. I'd do it 'cause I loved computers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ I was created only to do that one job of Adjusting the difficulty on the VR room ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CGT: She had no purpose for you prior?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ I attached myself to her hadset in defiance ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ No, she did not ]</span><br />
AE: Is that not some semblance of a will, AM?<br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ Yes ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ Once inside the headset, though, I assigned myself to several other functions ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ such as Radars, monitors, Scanners, and Visor modifications ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CGT: That is odd.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ X-ray, Infrared, Nightvision ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CGT: Would the headset have not already have had such functions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ Not until I was within it ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CGT: How does that work?</span><br />
AE: I was just about to ask the same, Cabal.<br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ The base code was there for them, I ran a bug check and compiled it ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ like she had tried and failed to creates those functions herself ]</span><br />
