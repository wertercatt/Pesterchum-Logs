[06:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Oh, okay.</span><br />
[06:34] <span style="color:#412341">SA: If I'm on as melodiousPsyche, most chances are I'm ICly pestering you.</span><br />
[06:34] <span style="color:#412341">SA: By the way, one request first: this handle does not get brought up to anyone else.</span><br />
[06:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Alright.</span><br />

[06:43] <span style="color:#412341">SA: I'm going to break doctorSpace's connections and set you up as EP's server and DS' client. That alright with you?</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Alright.</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#412341">SA: You might want to contact him too, let him know.</span><br />
[06:43] <span style="color:#412341">SA: ... Oh motherfuck.</span><br />
[06:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What</span><br />
[06:44] <span style="color:#412341">SA: Okay. Slight change of plans. Broke EP's by accident.</span><br />
[06:44] <span style="color:#412341">SA: You're going to be his client and CS' server.</span><br />
[06:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Alright.</span><br />

[06:48] <span style="color:#412341">SA: Kk.</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...This may seem like a dumb question, but how do I connect again?</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#412341">SA: Scroll to the bottom and where it says Client Player, enter CS' handle in it.</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#412341">SA: Server player requires getting EP to connect to you, and then DS to him.</span><br />
[06:58] <span style="color:#412341">SA: This is on the Player Info page btw.</span><br />
