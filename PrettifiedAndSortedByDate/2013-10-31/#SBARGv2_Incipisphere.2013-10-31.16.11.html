<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Learn to read the scene man, this is like</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: p sure she's at least competent enough to take care of herself for a couple days.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When you're in an RPG and someone's hanging off the side of a cliff and you can faf around doing whatever until you walk up to the place</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, as we sit her, the amount of chance she could be dead is increasing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: here*</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: the chance she could be alive is also increasing</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or when you're at the end of the game and a meteor's falling down, and that's the best time to go off and do all your silly little sidequests because nothing will happen until you actually go there</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And like /you/ said, THIS IS NOT A VIDEOGAME.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: yeah but she's like a big girl</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Well... until we get a becon on where she is, we can't do shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It kind of is though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: She's Schrodinger's birdgirl.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: She'll be fine until we open the box.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's not a game in some ways but in others it totally is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: wait if she's hanging off a cliff and she has wings</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: couldn't she like</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((meanwhile on /our/ side of the screen, she's just too busy with work or something I assume?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: totally fly up</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, lets flip a coin multiple times.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The laws of drama are in our favor literally nothing important happens offscreen</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's logical, though, MV.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How many times before it lands on tails?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: however many it takes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, it only needs to land on tails once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...FL, She is not dead. I hope. Calm yaself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ames has managed her way into main character status I'd wager, just by the sheer number of relationships she's built (not romantic before you even say anything)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: And She's Godtier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So there's no way she'll die offscreen</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: AND we have a maid of life on hand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: yeah so like what's the point of whining about her not being around for like</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: a day or two</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: neeeerd</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rob, you talk about this as if SCP-001 /does/ exist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FL, Raz has a point. Main characters have uberdramatic death scenes, not offscreen shit. Not to mention the whole conditional immortality and SL thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: She's too dramatic to die offscreen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Pretty much</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: That, and I think FL has  a crush on her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what is on screen, what is off?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: ^</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Think/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: FL totally has a crush on her</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: fl is crushing her so hard she might turn into diamonds</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's not even a thing you need to think about it's super obvs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This is more or less undisputable fact and if you try and deny it I'll actually sock you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not gonna deny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Computers. What do I do during SBARG? Computers. I'm good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i used to work on cars and play baseball</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Studying, Computers generally and Law insofar as careers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I played videogames all day and partook in a Homestuck RP on Formspring, before it crumbled and we jumped ship to ask.fm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: video game dev at a startup company. we did a minecraft mod initially, then we decided to make our own game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Well... I was JUST about to finish High School. Was in the photography club, along witht he computer club and a few others. Didn't know what I was gonna do in life. Also played video game and read books.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: this one time i went to a star wars convention</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: btw, I've been wondering for a while now... the fuck IS formspring anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#300661">CTT: I was jusτ a jobless person who can draw mediocre anime doodles</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Formspring is a website... thats kinda like tumblr.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except there was no way to reblog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i used to be a camp counselor too because my dad was like ex-military</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I used to roleplay a lot too. Generally tried to go for the villain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...I can totally see that, Gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: and then i was in school doing chemistry for virology </span><br />
<span style="color:#300661">CTT: I roleplayed as well..uh..iτ's a mixed bag.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Raz, my life was computers, playing viola, writing, school, and also computers. I didn't get out much. That /was/ actual stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah I meant the others</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But I did RPing too if that stuff counts. Relatively obscure fora, Gamefaqs funnily enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, other than game dev stuff, I just hung out at the college, going to club meetings even though I wasn't taking classes anymore...</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Mine was Kingdom hearts. God, My Oc was... bleh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We all gotta start somewhere… I was on a forum for the Maximum Ride books. Couple of 'em. Got into doing OC stuff with interesting plots and… definitely got a lot better over the few years I was there, haha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i've never roleplayed but maybe i should sometime</span><br />
<span style="color:#300661">CTT: I RP'd horrible ΘCs, τhen moved τo..uhh...a Touhou characτer in a crossover RP group</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i only knew that was a fetish </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think everyone sucked when they started roleplay- what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Don't even get me started on meh KH OCs my guy dual-wielded fire and ice keyblades and had shadow and light powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: just about the perfect little snowflake</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: MV, what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think Hotel has been my first real RP, actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: hahahaha his dad disappeared too, just to complete the obligatory convinently tragic backstory</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Heh. Mine was a Heartless/Nobody Duo, who used to be the same person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: yeah roleplay fetishes and shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: My first char was a twelve-year-old girl who accidentally stumbled into a… bank robbery, I think it was, cor that was long ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: There was like nothing special about her and she got taken hostage.</span><br />
