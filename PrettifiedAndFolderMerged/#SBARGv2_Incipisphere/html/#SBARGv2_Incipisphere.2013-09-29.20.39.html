<span style="color:#aa007f">CPK: (( yeah like once you select a charecter, you then chose an outfit ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((and like the character select screen might have sections for like players/npcs/villains or something))</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa007f">CPK: (( maybe have it say CHRONOS IS WATCHING in like small red text under the selection picture ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((ok cool, so even with the ABSOLUTE BIGGEST POSSIBLE SCENARIO of 70 different players wanting in, there'd still be room for six chars per person. obviously there is no way in the Ring we'd go that far, but yeah...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((chronos needs to be an snk boss at the end of arcade mode))</span><br />
