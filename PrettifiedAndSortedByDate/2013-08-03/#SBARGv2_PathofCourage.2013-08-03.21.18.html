[09:20:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would have picked wisdom, but what I have is intelegence, not wisdom.</span><br />
[09:20:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Power is just asking to be corrupted...</span><br />
[09:20:30] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: You need all three anyways.</span><br />
[09:20:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I picked this door.</span><br />
[09:20:43] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Wisdom to make the right choice. Strength to back yourself up. Courage to take the first step.</span><br />

[09:21:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And has I have always been known to charge blindly... well, this is just my door.</span><br />
[09:21:17] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Of course. I try and round myself out, but the courage door was always going to be the most fun.</span><br />
[09:21:56] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I'm... more Wisdom, really, but...</span><br />
[09:22:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Really?</span><br />
[09:22:27] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I'd hopefully like to think so. </span><br />
[09:22:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets see, wing currents can't push you if you wear the iron boots in the zelda games...</span><br />
[09:22:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wind*</span><br />
[09:23:01] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...No way is this seriously a rip of zelda.</span><br />
[09:23:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But that would be too slow...</span><br />

[09:23:54] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: But yeah. Wisdom. I dunno. Have a tendency to observe and plan before acting, so I guess that works? Shit, whatever. Courage, like Nico said, seemed most fun.</span><br />
[09:24:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  just keeps running for as long as he feels ground. --</span><br />
[09:24:47] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wisdom is overrated.</span><br />
[09:25:02] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: We're all teenagers, if they were wise, they'd know it was a bad choice.</span><br />
[09:25:34] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: To play a fucked up Game where the first guardian's the big bad, and we're all irresponsible fucks, yeah?</span><br />
