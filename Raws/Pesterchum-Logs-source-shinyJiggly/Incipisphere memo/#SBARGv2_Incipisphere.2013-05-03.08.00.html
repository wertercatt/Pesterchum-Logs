<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...a batch of brownies that a particular player made a while back...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Why not eat them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: contents of said brownies have ...effects</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Pot brownies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ..yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not exactly keen on having these things anywhere nearby.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So...volcano?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might as well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's the best way to get them there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: A cannon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Can you send them to me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but then the code will be saved forever in the logs</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, what steps are we going to need to follow?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: First, we need a large catapult, or some kind of propulsion system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just enough to get it off the planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm...</span><br />
