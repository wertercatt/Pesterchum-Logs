[08:27:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Morning</span><br />
[08:28:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I kinda looked at Kimura's log of last night... I for one, would be willing to stay if neeeded.</span><br />
[08:33:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ben, you listening?</span><br />

[08:33:30] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hm?</span><br />
[08:34:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did you read Kimura's recap?</span><br />
[08:34:26] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: of what?</span><br />
[08:34:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of what Chronos was yapping on about last night</span><br />
[08:35:41] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no but i just did</span><br />
[08:35:55] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...christ, me and quinn are both life players</span><br />
[08:36:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[08:36:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it blocks us, you know I'm going to be ripping apart at the code to let us through.</span><br />
[08:36:39] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
[08:36:47] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: whats your classpect again?</span><br />
[08:36:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rogue of Heart.</span><br />
[08:38:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I wonder if players can keep their sylladex while going through...</span><br />
[08:38:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And I just figured out a simple way to break the system.</span><br />
[08:38:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if that /is/ the case</span><br />
[08:39:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, with my concept, if that works... If we could captcha the lands...</span><br />
[08:39:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:40:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
[08:43:31] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...fl, youre possibly a hero</span><br />
[08:44:01] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but if it doesnt work and you try to captcha them, you might accidentally commit genocide again</span><br />
[08:45:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why we are going to have to have one person go through and try to communicate with us.</span><br />
[08:45:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...With a single consort.</span><br />
[08:46:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then we have someone go through (if that works) having captchaed a single player of a matching aspect/class</span><br />
[08:46:23] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no, with a sylladex of items</span><br />
[08:46:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright</span><br />
[08:46:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so three steps</span><br />
[08:46:37] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: first we test if /items/ work</span><br />
[08:46:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1, items, 2, consorts, 3, players, 4, ENTIRE SESSION</span><br />
[08:47:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so 4 I guess</span><br />
[08:47:20] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah</span><br />
[08:47:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, one of the items the first person will bring through will be a transportalizer.</span><br />
[08:47:50] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: mmhmm</span><br />
[08:48:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If this works, we will be able to bring much more than just the players.</span><br />
[08:48:16] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...and me and quinn stay behind until weve confirmed multiple players can go through</span><br />
[08:49:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll be the one preforming the fourth step if it works... After all, my modus is able to captcha small meteors if I have enough space, I should be able to upgrade that to entire lands.</span><br />

[08:51:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And considering that captcha cards /can/ be made from artifact grist, I will not need to dip into the hoard at all.</span><br />

[09:07:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah</span><br />
[09:07:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If this works</span><br />
[09:08:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I should be able to bring the entire session (lands and all) through the door.</span><br />
