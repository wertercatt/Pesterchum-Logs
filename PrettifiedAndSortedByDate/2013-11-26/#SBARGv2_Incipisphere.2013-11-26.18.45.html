[08:23:27] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: I am certain you are well-aware you have not done this out of some sense of wanting to help or be nice.</span><br />
[08:23:46] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: The fucker attacked Crux.</span><br />
[08:23:59] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: It needed to die.</span><br />
[08:24:11] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: I am aware of your opinion on this matter.</span><br />
[08:24:30] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: I am also aware that death does not generally involve taxidermy.</span><br />
[08:25:16] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: Well I figured it would be more polite than just throwing a bloody mew head at her window.</span><br />
[08:26:14] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: There is also the possibility that you could have not done anything of such a nature with the corpse.</span><br />
[08:26:27] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: With Mew gone, the problems that have been caused by me are all taken care of, and now we can all be calm again.</span><br />
[08:26:34] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: Since thats what you all wanted.</span><br />
[08:26:45] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: Was a peaceful aftergame.</span><br />
[08:27:05] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: It will never cease to amaze me how utterly ridiculous you can sound sometimes.</span><br />
[08:28:08] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: To stave off the inevitable self-deprecation or statements that truly sound worthy of a madhouse, I will be withdrawing now.</span><br />
[08:36:49] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: hehehehe</span><br />
[09:11:37] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: Hi FF! :D</span><br />
[09:11:51] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: The Mew is no longer a threat.</span><br />
[09:11:51] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a2a280">CURRENT foolishFool [CFF]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[09:11:51] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Heya FL! How goes things?</span><br />
[09:12:03] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: huh... how?</span><br />
[09:12:42] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: I killed it.</span><br />
[09:13:05] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: Cut off its head, then had it Taxidermied.</span><br />
[09:13:27] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...uh huh.</span><br />
[09:13:59] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: But hey, at least everything is calm again, right?</span><br />
[09:14:52] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...yeah.</span><br />
[09:15:31] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: I figure since Alice said Gambit won't want it, I'll put it on a nice shelf somewhere.</span><br />
[09:15:39] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />
[09:17:06] <span style="color:#0060c0">CFL: Anyway, see you later!</span><br />
