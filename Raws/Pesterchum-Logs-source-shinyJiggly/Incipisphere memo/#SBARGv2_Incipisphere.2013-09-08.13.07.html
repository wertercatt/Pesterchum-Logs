<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((like ill probably end up handing amy and lk over to somebody))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yo, anybody up for a tourney at the dojo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: just for fun</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Uh, nah. I'm just gonna continue sleeping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: id kinda like to fight some of you mofos</span><br />

<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: We already talked, and me and LK are part of it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#12075b">CLK: Indeed!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sounds fun, actually. plus it'd be good training practice for fighting the three Final Bosses...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah sure that too</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: YES.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: TOURNAMENT YES GOOD &gt;:D</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: athena i dont think a denizen participating would be fair</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no offense</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Ooooh, tournament now? That sounds interesting to watch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: I would not be participating, just watching.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: natch</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: I'm in a dungeon now</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I assume this would be spread out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: we arent doing this all at once yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, has anyone heard from Sog?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just a question... I mean, he is a good little cat robot that looks like a tails doll but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont know dont care</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and hannahs friend who might know where she would be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: After consulting my server player, I believe she's agreed to participate in a fighting tournament. I'd like to join myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also for balance's sake: i dont really think gt powers or frays should be allowed</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: thoughts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: nono we need to use the,</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: them*</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but some of us havent even tiered</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: or gotten all our frays</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, it isn't really fun unless all of us are fighting at our maxinum.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maximum*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Some of our powers might not be the most useful in a solo combat situation anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but at the same time some of them /are/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we cant hold back</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: like as maid of life most of my abilities suck for 1v1 combat</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but, say, knight of rage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ouo</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: not all tiers are created equal</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...then we should split into randomized teams of two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: incase we get passive players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but thats gonna be even more of a pain to schedule...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why don't we do both solo and team battles?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  Shouldn't be too hard to schedule, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well if we team then that means we need to wait for 4 people to be available instead of just 2</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but then again, it shouldn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It shouldn't be /too/ hart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hard*</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think 1v1 would be more fun, but maybe thats me</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So make team battles /another/ event.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We need the practise -.-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats just you</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and each rung, it randomizes the players who are teamed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...lets stick with 1v1</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I'd also be interested in team battles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I have no practise with anyone outside of DL, and believe it would be a good way to meet other players and perhaps a lesson in teamwork.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to be able to learn to work as a teamwith /anyone/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: including people we don't like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It'd be really good practise not killing each other!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … or only killing the each other we're supposed to kill :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...bluh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: complicated</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nooot really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just do everyone in 1v1s.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And anyone who /wants/ to build teamwork skills can do 2v2s! :DDD</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll do both!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but lets just focus on 1v1 for now</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: Why not arrange them both at the same time? If you are already compiling a list of interested blokes, it would be simpler to add names to two lists instead of going back and asking later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok, so... fl, ip, and ag are interested right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: me too i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets compile a piratepad list of everyone... then use <a href='http://www.random.org'>http://www.random.org</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: My server, DL, is as well. Or so I believe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no were doing a gird format not an elimination bracket</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: everyone fights everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then use points to continue on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ((also im giving everyone their own themes for the tourney, if you have a particular theme you want let me know, preferably extended))</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yep</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus it might cause issues with your internal circuitry... unless you had that shielded...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Correct!</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffa407">CCG: Someone message me when Ash gets on, I need to talk to her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: can I state that it might be best if DT doesn't do this /at all?/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Meanie.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Meanie meanie meanie.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you cant use any alloy above whatever your drone normally uses ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but you can load yourself down with whatever friggin crazy weapons you want</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's why I was saying, get Ash to create a virtual avatar for DT so he can strife man-to-"man". it IS a holodeck, after all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Then I might as well not even...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">AHAHAHAHAHA</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: until you make me regret that decision too</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well i mean if he uses easy-to-break armor then he can use weapons as he wishes</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: just be a motherfuckin' glass cannon</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">...I wonder if I could use porygon logic... then install Pokemon moves on a drone...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Focus Sash.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you realize the fear strategy is easily broken by any sort of healing at all</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">oh, never mind then.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: seriously if you know its coming fear is easy as fuck to counter</span><br />
<span style="color:#7e2c15">CIP: I am honestly more interested in this concept of team battles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#161616">CWD: ▲nd only one of those equipped at maximum!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">I'll just load my drone up with all sorts of moves, like Guillotine and Lock-on.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh fucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /fuck/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: again, safest thing would be a virtual avatar. as long as Ash and Adam set the access permissions correctly...</span><br />
