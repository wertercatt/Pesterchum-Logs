<span style="color:#969619">CEU: So, which horror literature are you trying to read?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: lovecraft</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: the thing is</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: my parents are a little bit unaccepting of different people</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ah, wonderfull. The original lovecraft, or the expansive shared universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: original</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Aha. The original is nice for seeing the origins and of course his writings, though one can also see the author's...rather unfortunate beliefs on race and society in the same strok</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: *Stroke</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Product of its time and author and all that</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: it was the early 20th century; racism was the norm back then, and some publishers actually refused to publish anti-racist literature</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: but there were people who fought against that</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: earl derr biggers wrote the charlie chan detective stories. chan is stereotypical, but he is a positive stereotype</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: even though i think stereotypes are damaging in any way</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: they're either openly discriminating or otherwise condescending</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: they can be both, too</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: but yeah, it all boils down to it being the early 20th century</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: test</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: tea set</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Stereotypes are a problem because it takes a set of assumptions, usually false or misinformed, and then applies them to all members that fit into the group that said steretype is applied to before any actual interaction and learning takes place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: As for Lovecraft, he was a pretty racist dude. Trying to remember that one story in which one of the big shocks was that the evil family was in fact mixed-race he wrote. Some of it boils down to the time period, some of it ends up just being his own viewpoint on life. Still a fascinating author though</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: wow the victorian and the early post-victorian one were racist as fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: i guess racism was an integral part of imperialism, and i guess people would've been considered traitors if they weren't racist</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's a mixture of both, really. Even if you weren't racist by the time period standards by modern day standards you could be, you could not believe in the status quo but still go along with it like many did, you could actively believe in such viewpoints, you could fight it, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: you seem to know a lot more than me about that time period</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's especially complicated when you take other major prejudices and issues in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I have a fondness for history and major issues and how they were percieved throughout history</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's an ugly side of humanity, but a fascinating one nonetheless</span><br />
