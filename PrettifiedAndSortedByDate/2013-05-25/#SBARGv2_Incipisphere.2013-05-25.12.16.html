<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: hey guys why did I come to sword base. though I must say it's pretty cool. is there are unused room where i can set up my gravity training equipment?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm pretty sure there is</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, got the transportalizer at my house set up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#4274c4">CURRENT shadowsPaintbrush [CSP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: i GuesS i CaN AttenD</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: ThougH Won'T WE NeeD SomE SorT OF BonE EnforcemenT TO WithstanD ThE IncreaseD GravitY WithouT GivinG OuT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well do you know which floor. I should most likely get back to trainning\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you'd have to talk to SV or SVsprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CS, you fine with me dropping a transportalizer outside your house?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I know DBZ was cool with what it did but I dunno if that junk'll really work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: alright i will when and if they show up. till then I guess i'll just wonder around seeing if I can find a room on my own. or maybe make a for swordbase set of the things\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, I have one with me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We're built to function in /this/ level of gravity, even if we can manage stuff in increased grav that might not really translate? Or that's what I saw when I searched somethin like that up a while back...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We aren't mario, we can't operate in 5Gs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...CS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mind answering me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe he's busy</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well even now the human body can withstand several times the affect of gravity poilts go thround increases in gravity based on pure speed however we are not using speed to increase the gravity and I am being very careful\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll just take his lack of an answer as that he doesn't care and set it down right here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Now onto SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I have the gauntlet set for incase of blackouts to reset to normal gravity\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sorta tired today from yesterday...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, are you fine with a transportalizer setup outside your house?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would be awesomr</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And thats taken care of...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll wait until later to set everyone else up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3/7 isn't so bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry RS and SP, I can't exactly reach your lands with the gates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I can't put transportalizers outside your house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: NO NeeD, i HavE AlternatE WayS OF TraveL</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, how do these transportalizers link up anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The all warp to a secluded room on a veil meteor that is a nexus to get to the other transportalizers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So you can get to mine, yours and CS's land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, let me set up the holo projectors...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've also managed to disable all the others until something travels through the other end.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4274c4">CSP: You'vE GoT SomE NicE TecH. i WoulD LikE TO SeE ThE BlueprintS WheN i GeT ThE ChancE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So don't worry about teleporting into my sylladex.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its just me ripping other transportalizers out of the ground, relinking them, and moving them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Due to the way they work, you won't have to worry about... teleporting into a void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...or a wall</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: More like you have to worry about not teleporting if the corruption is chasing you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...That actually might be worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But if it comes down to it, you guys should be able to blow apart some walls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...like I did to get the transportalizers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, though I'm not too keen on using my emergency weapon...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: last time I used it a building almost crushed me</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, TT would likely be able to blow through the walls.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm beginning to wonder if we should just cut our losses and get out of the session while we still can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, there has got to be a huge number of other sessions we could make our home.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well, I'm back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we can't just give up</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS, NV?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm not giving up on this session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think you couldhead to TT's land to pick up two transportalizers? </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah, definitely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I realize SJ might be right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe I'm acting like my pre scratch self.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, he apparently abandoned the session to escape the scratch...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I'm not givin' up. Came too far for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, see you at TT's land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll see if I can pick up more transportalizers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm gonna take a nap for a little bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Have a nice nap</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSJ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I made a few yesterday, actually. Didn't think anything'd come of them but I got... 4 pairs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After you make it to TT's land, hand me half of the pairs, I'll move them to the nexus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And set them up so we don't have to worry about teleporting into a modus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Right, right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( SBARGv2_LoIaR ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ack... hold on. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (* <a href='#SBARGv2_LoIaR'>#SBARGv2_LoIaR</a> )</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((no prob mate))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: AIght, so you can just head through your second gate to me then through mine to Kat's land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Right Nico?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SP, if you wanna make it easier to get to your land, I would recommend stopping by.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No, I'm just taking a ride</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Gates are stupid</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We had an... interesting meeting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: our chat was an intresting one also</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ((also who is samel and why does he have Yaldabaoth?))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I understand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ???</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might not wanna reveal details, as the memo is not exactly secure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be a simple task to hide yourself within the memo and not be seen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I could think of something really witty right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But whoever's hiding would steal it</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Wow I am tired.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...He lied.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think I might have overshot the third gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and landed in the fourth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I don't think TT will be happy about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: I sugest you exit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...crap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Return Bracelet is broken.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: There should be an exit portal behind you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Should?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The fourth gate shouldn't work for anyone else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But the land's player.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tell that to the fourth gate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: check if your in your denizens layer</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: and not TT's</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...no, the gps says I'm on TT's land still.</span><br />

<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: ok ok I am coming with a rope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Denizen will probably kill you</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((I am pretty sure the Fourth Gate on someone else's land wouldn't work for anyone but that land's player or else people could just team up and bumrush one.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((or barring that it won't work for a second time))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: how did you backflip through the 4th gate there are floors between the two</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( This session is filled with glitches, and you can get gold grist by making underling attracting paint. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nobody ever said he was a clever man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((Kat's not here to resolve whatever you're doing and I personally wouldn't muck with other people's land junk.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( This is the least of the balance issues. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: Grab the rope!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Didn't she like kill the denizen? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: FL grab it! climb!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...uh, that might be hard to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Rope is kinda... cut.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: or atleast hold on</span><br />
<span style="color:#008b00">CDS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((I don't think so but I'm not sure))</span><br />
