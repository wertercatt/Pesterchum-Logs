<div class=memolog>
[04:14:49] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 HOTELWORLDBUILDING.</span><br />
[04:14:53] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:14:53] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay ➜</span><br />
[04:15:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's get to working this stuff out ➜</span><br />
[04:15:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe you should invite the people on the main memo, just incase</span><br />
[04:15:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay ➜</span><br />
[04:17:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let's look at the examples through past events first ➜</span><br />
[04:17:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: First off, how strange is it to the general population to have Slim and other people popping up?</span><br />
[04:18:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: slightly odd, but not unheard of.  ➜</span><br />
[04:18:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is it common place for interdimentional travel?</span><br />
[04:18:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: for some it is, though most NPC types don't even mess with it ➜</span><br />
[04:19:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is there methods to give alternate universe immagrants citizenship?</span><br />
[04:19:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: immigrants*</span><br />
[04:20:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: &lt;/seriousbusiness&gt;</span><br />
[04:20:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  hasn't thought out most of these things @ _@ --</span><br />
[04:20:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That matters because the most common people that would be popping in are magic users or people with aperture level tech.</span><br />
[04:21:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thus, cultural contaminaton.</span><br />
[04:22:03] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#280262">??? timeTravlur [?TT]</span> ??:?? FROM ???? responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:22:03] <span style="color:#280262">?TT: ((before I afk I'm just gonna wonder how my mindscape is going to work *shot*))</span><br />
[04:22:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, there was a confused oregon trail guy once, and another time a tf2 medic appeared ➜</span><br />
[04:23:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or for example, how Edward got pulled into Eberron, with spacetimewedgies pulling people all over...</span><br />
[04:23:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Like Niki and Gambit I guess</span><br />
[04:23:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Your character versions I mean</span><br />
[04:23:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000aa">CURRENT Noodles [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:23:43] <span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Remember internetExplorer?</span><br />
[04:23:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not the actuall yous.</span><br />
[04:23:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and IC!Shon is from an alt future ➜</span><br />
[04:23:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, islandEsacaper... ➜</span><br />
[04:24:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Shon?</span><br />
[04:24:07] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: DS ➜</span><br />
[04:24:11] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: doctorSpace ➜</span><br />
[04:24:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
[04:25:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah</span><br />
[04:25:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure exactly about SS. He had to have been from somewhere special to be able to figure out how to become a steampunk cyborg ➜</span><br />
[04:26:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But it seems that the Hotel universe seems to be quite an interdimentional nexus point.</span><br />
[04:26:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And not everyone from home universes knows exactly how magic and tech work.</span><br />
[04:27:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And due to spacetimewedgies, they would be deposited with only the clothes on their back, unless they had some method to leave...</span><br />
[04:28:00] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#599681">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[04:28:00] <span style="color:#599681">CAG: Do we have Sylladexes or something? I thought we did...</span><br />
[04:28:18] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we do have sylladexes, or at least those who choose to use them. ➜</span><br />
[04:28:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I would Imagine it being low tech with people pooling together knowledge, and making a new home here.</span><br />
[04:28:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, people might be from universes without sylladexes.</span><br />
[04:29:04] <span style="color:#599681">CAG: Mhm...</span><br />
[04:29:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can't really imagine many, but Edward doesn't have one.</span><br />
[04:29:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As he was booted from his home universe before they were common place.</span><br />
[04:30:10] <span style="color:#599681">CAG: I've got what she'll probably refer to as a transdimensional storage pocket. Or, what's that one word she heard, Sylladex for short. xD</span><br />
[04:30:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL has layered bags of holding.</span><br />
[04:30:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and by that I mean Edward.</span><br />
[04:31:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kinda like my file system modus when you think about it.</span><br />
[04:31:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: my char still uses my old cheap modus. ➜</span><br />
[04:31:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which can only eject and get stuff shoved in all at once ➜</span><br />
[04:32:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pfft</span><br />
[04:33:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, what else should we get cleared up? ➜</span><br />
[04:33:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, with the visitors, I assume that there would be lowtier Magitech?</span><br />
[04:34:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: possibly? ➜</span><br />
[04:34:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And while the high tech people would advocate for a digital medium of currency, the magic users would perfer something more... material.</span><br />
[04:35:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that would make sense. ➜</span><br />
[04:36:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hence the Gold Coin and Boondollar/bitcoin split.</span><br />
[04:36:54] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that seems legit. ➜</span><br />
[04:37:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And both currencys are legal tender in the hotel universe.</span><br />
[04:37:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However the gold coins here would weigh alot less than 1/20th of a pound.</span><br />
[04:37:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which are how much Edward's gold pieces weigh.</span><br />
[04:38:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />
[04:38:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And with the high tech and the ocean nearby, salt would be easy to get.</span><br />
[04:38:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thus setting it at a much lower value than silver.</span><br />
[04:38:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: instead of the same like in DnD.</span><br />
[04:40:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...any comments on that?</span><br />
[04:41:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, if it makes sense, might as well make it a thing. ➜</span><br />
[04:41:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It make sense to anyone else?</span><br />
[04:41:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit, Rob?</span><br />
[04:41:45] <span style="color:#599681">CAG: Sure, perfect sense.</span><br />
[04:41:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably should make a post about it on the hotel blog. ➜</span><br />
[04:42:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: for reference ➜</span><br />
[04:42:22] <span style="color:#280262">?TT: hmm.</span><br />
[04:42:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Question is... what is the value of the currencys based on say, the US dollar?</span><br />
[04:42:54] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no idea @ _@ ➜</span><br />
[04:43:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Any other moments where currency was a question?</span><br />
[04:44:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like in a balanced price?</span><br />
[04:44:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Instead of the price for the search or something?</span><br />
[04:44:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... ➜</span><br />
[04:45:21] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there was one point where there was something about buying a cheese pizza, but I don't think there was a price put out there, just that it was going on NN's tab. ➜</span><br />
[04:45:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Huh...</span><br />
[04:48:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does the world use, Imperial, Metric, or Planck?</span><br />
[04:50:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units</a> as you might not know about the last one.</span><br />
[04:50:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Obviously it would boost up in base 10...</span><br />
[04:50:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, most of them seem to be humans...</span><br />
[04:50:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or aliens with 10 fingers</span><br />
[04:52:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: @ _@ these maths are confusing ➜</span><br />
[04:55:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets just agree on metric then</span><br />
[04:55:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay?</span><br />
[04:56:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />
[04:57:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, Metric Scale, Low Level Magitech, interdimentional immigrants, and Gold Coin/Credit standart.</span><br />
[04:57:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: standard*</span><br />
[04:58:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Metric is gonna be hell for Edward it seems...</span><br />
[04:59:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And exchange rate between credits and gold coins is 1 Gold Coin to 1000 Credits.</span><br />
[05:00:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So... 10 credits for a pound of salt?</span><br />
[05:01:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so? ➜</span><br />
[05:01:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That would make a single credit about... 10 cents.</span><br />
[05:03:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or about the exact same as a boon dollar.</span><br />
[05:03:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least for MY consorts.</span><br />
[05:04:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Leopard Geckos are the best.</span><br />
[05:04:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The best.</span><br />
[05:05:29] <span style="color:#280262">?TT: huh...</span><br />
[05:06:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, that price sound good?</span><br />
[05:06:25] <span style="color:#599681">CAG: sure</span><br />
[05:11:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, I think we can get back to the thing now ➜</span><br />
[05:12:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <a href='#SBARGv2_Hotel'>#SBARGv2_Hotel</a> ➜</span><br />
