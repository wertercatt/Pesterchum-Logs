<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 because bullshit :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, someone who entered 2 hours after the first entry, would enter 2 months into the session.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: every two hours equals a month here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and that splits into minutes lining up with days</span><br />
