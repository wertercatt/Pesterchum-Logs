<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, there was this person. Apparently from this universe. I was worried about them finding the replicators and other tec.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait, two intergalactic visitors in the same morning?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Because that stuff can really do a number, and I was worried for both their civilization and out well being. "What if they wanted more tech that we didn't have" sort of thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Shrug? I never met the person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, that sparked a whole argument.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: its usually a bad idea to be a frozenLake in a frozen lake</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, the first visitor was a blatant Sonic OC that thought we were serving Eggman and tried to steal our "Chaos Emerald" (read: FL's ring server), and since I apparently looked like a Mobian, I had to explain what was going on...</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That REALLY set FL off, and the argument only became much more heated from there...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: plus what if SL made sharks</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (sharks don't live in fresh water, idiot)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: i'm staying here, for the record...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I have no idea... honestly the argument spiraled out of control faster than a new player on rainbow-road.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I dunno, FL, what if SL made them fresh water creatures?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: he could really do anything he wanted</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (and leave me the hell alone)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I donno... I admit that I wasn't 100% myself, seeing as I got nothing to eat before all that, but I still am worried about the fact that he let the visitor just go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: because i'm staying here</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // And are adorable. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  pauses, looking at the adorable glowy-fish. If only she had a camera...oh well. She'll say hello to these fish again, later. She looks around the cave. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // There seems to be an air pocket. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  hurredly rushes over to the air pocket. She'll appriciate being able to breathe oxygen and talk again, if only to herself... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes off the H20-Breather, once she's at the air pocket. "Ohthankgosh...pleh... okay..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // There seems to be stalagmites and stalactites. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Holy fuck is that gold? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  examines the stalactites, looking for anything interesting- Ooooooh gold! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I love how I can make interesting places that could exist on earth ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  rushes over to the shiny stuff... how to aquire it... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  wait treasure was not her goal! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Oh look! A bat! --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  looks at the bat, squinting. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I like bats. Don't try anything, and nither will I. Gotcha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // The bat doesn't really seem to under stand, just staring blankly at EQ. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  sighs, looking about the rest of the area... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... All else fails: Assume there is a secret lever desguised as a stalagmite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // Oh, /there/ is FL. Sitting in the dark. staring at a small collection of water with glowing fish. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Ah? Charles!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: There you are!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  slowly walks over to FL, looking at the fish. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  sticks his finger in the water. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So... dare I ask why you ran to here, of all places?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, besides for the fish. Those are nice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well its quiet</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  pauses. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'll... I'll give you that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and usually people don't come down here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Again: that is quite true... I guess I can see why you like it. 'Mind if I sit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I kinda blew up today.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes a seat next to FL, looking down at the fish. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh... so did I, really. I said things I promised myself I wouldnt. Oops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...You alright?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah... I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just... felt that wiping his memories would be pointless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, when he was sent here, he knew about the ring server, our "communication device" as he called it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I... I see.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so... what good would it have done if he was just sent back with his memories wiped?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They would have considered the first mission a failure and sent more troops next time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Bluh... honestly? </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //wait what? the visitor actually /was/ the one I was here for? I thought someone said there was a second one after I left... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I was not 100% there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I'm just worried.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Space is big, and it takes a lot to travel. They saw that we have replicators and resources here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: What if they wanted it for themselves?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That's what I was worried about.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it was a confined system</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For all they knew, food could have just been teleported in</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For the random visitor, your mind wipe would work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but for people that are sent... thats when issues arise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And it's not a mind-wipe. Its honestly worse than that, and it's why I feel bad for suggesting that in the first place.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, and it just isn't cost effective to hunt down every visitor and wipe their minds...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, I will start work on masking the signal for the Server...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That would be a good idea, yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And it's honestly not something I would want to do, really. It's something that would have to be done, if I went along that route.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I just... not everyone is going to be so friendly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well yeah he did start out with attacking my security system</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then again, he thought we worked for eggman</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah... still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Space travel is costly. People will want rewards for their efforts, in one form or another.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Meeting them on their planets is one thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Them meeting us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The things most people will get out of intergalactic travel is cultural and technological.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Honestly, I think we should open ourselves up to trade.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think aliens might have some really good pop culture.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Tch... maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah, resources can be collected from meteors and lifeless planets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Invasions are pointless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you want to enslave the popluation, but if you are advanced enough to make it into deep space, one could make robots.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so the only reason one would have slaves is for cultural reasons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed... and we players would sure make for some annoying pets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Assuming we didn't prevent ourselves from becoming slaves with our powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  holds out a hand. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets go back to the surface.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  takes the hand. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Lead the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // There is a flash of flames as EQ and FL warp to the surface like the phoenix travel in harry potter. --</span><br />
