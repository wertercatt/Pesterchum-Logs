<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I need 111 Zillium to make the next sword of my planning, and I already have 21.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I need 90 more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ Nice, need help? /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, not really...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ Eh,kayy, figured I'd offer /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've already disabled transfer of zillium, so no one steals my work from me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ Whyy would I want to steal it? /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ I was gonna come help yyou hunt for it but... /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT fromAshes <span style="color:#d00000">[CFA]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry, I just know that Zillium is valuable, and everyone wants it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's element 163?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d00000">CFA: (\ *appears to be the onlyy person who doesn't want ti then* /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A period 8 element that would be under roentgenium.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus, I thought Zillium only came from Trickster Tier alchemy and underlings?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats why I've been searching for the underlings that drop it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  doesn't want Zillium either, even if there's a trickster-tier Reflector no one's told him about... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also FL, since Dream You fell asleep before pesterchum stopped being a laggy butt:</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CFL ceased responding to memo. CCP: sometimes FL, I think your dreamself/realself sanity got flipped. dreamselves are usually the cloud cuckoolanders, but in your case, Dream You is the saner of the pair. CCP: kaslfjaslfkjaslfjasljfljasljf he left already</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Incredibly powerful weapons tend to use it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just looked at it again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS NOT ZILLIUM!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I SPENT ALL THIS TIME LOOKING FOR IT AND ITS NOT ZILLIUM I NEED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  most predictable facepaw yet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its that weird flashy diamond grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. Sunstone, or something like that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, this.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it looks like NOONE HAS IT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((wow. firefox just got REALLY angry at me when I opened that gif.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I might have to do this tab-bonking in stages, restarting the browser every 50 or so))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Gog, I never have that many open. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Then again, I don't get into TV tropes like everyone else does. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((tvtropes isn't my problem. newtabbing random shit then forgetting about it the next day is. <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/mspa/dat_tab_count.png'>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/mspa/dat_tab_count.png</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Thats why... hold on, I need to close a few of my tabs. At least I can still read the names of mine! ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gog, We need to start making a list of the grists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((firefox has a tab-bar scrolling thing when you exceed 12. chrome just crams them all on one bar, AND retrieves every page simultaniously on restart))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((while FF only reloads a statesaved tab when you actually click on it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( See, I never knew that. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Except for the savestate thing. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I believe there was a grist cache list somewhere...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it's actually called Session Restore (and delayed-tab-reload is Tabs On Demand), but I call it statesaving because protonjon))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, if that atomic element does exist, it might take something like 1000 of all the flashy grists... each.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there's also supposed to be mouseover tooltips in GristTorrent, but that might be broken because minor bug</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Lets make a list with all the grists and they lands they are usually found on! :D ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((my land has just the "basic" type grists (Build, Shale, other common ones), along with Ink Grist which might be exclusive to me...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, lets make a list of the Ingredients for this sword of mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1 Billion Gold and Uranium, and 111 of Spectral Gem Grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: one billion? frogdamn...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats for each one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I hope it's worth it. what if it ends up being, like, SORD........ level?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Judging from the scans, its 3 times as powerful a blade as my Golden Sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But considering that the Skyward strike has been powering up exponentially...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I might be able to one shot a Titachnid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I still have a few more levels to go on my brush techniques... but it's kinda hard to alchemize upgrades when your primary weapon is your own tail</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though now that I think about it, Badges are a thing. and I probably have a lot of unused BP to fill with things...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Had to take care of some underlings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I figure you guys may have already spent yours, so have you spotted any of the Flashy Diamond Grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope, haven't seen any of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: afaik, it's the same rareness tier as Zillium, but without the "Trickster Class underlings" restriction...</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CFI: if he tαkes my grist αgαin i'm going to kick his αss for reαl this time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I just really want that Roentgenium Sword, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: as for me, I'm experimenting to see how Badge alchemy works, since they're probably the upgrade path I have to go with</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And you don't have the grist I need, FI.</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CFI: whαt is the nαme of the grist?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It should say it when I've collected it, but until then, well, Its gonna be a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: hα</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: in this fucked up session we probαbly don't hαve thαt kind of grist</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CFI: sure you will</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I find your lack of faith... disturbing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait did I actually just say that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes. yes you did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :p</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: your realself is more of a cuckoolander than your dreamself........ and that's probably not a good thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ((Wait what))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Can we just blame everything abnormal in the session on Bakagami and call it a day?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Okay, I just dozed off for a little bit and what happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I made a star wars quote and CP just said that I'm more of a cloud cuckoolander than my dreamself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. I just shrugged off a LOAD MANA error since I don't have a "mana" meter, I have Ink Pots and FP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hooray for exact-words errors</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O weird</span><br />

<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: Perhaps I should try again</span><br />

<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: what place might you be referring to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: We need to stick a tracking device on her, with the amount of times that she's gotten lost.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not sure, but I don't think it was inkdarkness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: thank god. fighting her was not fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Do you need help?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might be useful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't think she's here at the cathedral.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Okay, I'm heading towards the catherdral- been there before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say we put trackers on EVERYONE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we break the encryption for them up between multiple players, so one person can't go crazy and hunt down everyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS:  </span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ,,,FL. Your Ideas are as terrible as always.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: slapping FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seriously, I really do think the sanity level of his realself and dreamself got swapped somehow</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I suppose it could be a security risk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: security and privacy, too</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why do you think I would have the codes split between the players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like how you need a bunch of launch codes for a nuke.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meh, true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And you need like 5 or so to launch it, or find out the location of a player.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: we just can't get away from atom-based bassa-boom, can we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or antimatter based.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or kinetic based.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or- I'll shut up now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hey, at least my consorts have an excuse for their obsession.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (and just fyi, if you come anywhere near me with a collar, tracking or otherwise........)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wasn't thinking a collar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was thinking a TINY injection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like a microchip?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not happening</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: look, the Sbarg Server Interface can track players through Weird Code Shit. all we have to do is find out how to replicate that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It can't track past the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless your suggesting we make tendrills of house over our lands....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ......</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........uh, no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that'd cost more build grist than the Ultimate Alchemy, for one...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not if you make the paths thin enough!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And considering sburb has no building support physics, we could easily have paths that are THREE ATOMS THICK going across the entire land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Question is, if you take a piece of the house, like rip out a plank... can you zoom into the plank?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, there is another more roundabout way to locate someone... getting info from their future selves (or our own future selves)</span><br />
