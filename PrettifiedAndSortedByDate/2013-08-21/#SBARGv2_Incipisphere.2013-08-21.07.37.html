[08:01:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I as a heart player recommends to try and get another dream that isn't a void.</span><br />
[08:02:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That sounds like the best option. Luck with that.</span><br />
[08:03:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't try to draw the beasts' attention, unless you aren't really using your mind.</span><br />
[08:03:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: pretty sure chronos existing is doing that enough.</span><br />

[08:08:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … And accordin' to somethin' I think might know, Samael's motive was never "revenge".</span><br />
[08:09:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Or maybe it was, but accordin' to this thing the dreamself murders were to strike preemptive blows at those who would be threats to his future self.</span><br />

[08:11:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Treat him differently, maybe he wouldn't've ended up so bad, but then you would've doomed the timeline so what's it matter?</span><br />
[08:11:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's all in the past anyway.</span><br />
