<span style="color:#00916a">CMB: Its concern about blasphamy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00916a">CMB: Did he even experiment with this power source?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Now MB. I am soon to post an entirely new version of my mapping system.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: With that thing you could probably place your second gate connection in a more.. tactical way.</span><br />
