<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 STARTERPLANET.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  exits the bar, heading forest-ward --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // You see a foot twitching, sticking out of a large amount of sharp leaves. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  thinks about it, and equips the KSP spacesuit to be safe, then walks over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is pretty stuck in those vines. And the only tree stump he could have tripped on is 2 meters away. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  // You see, this is why you don't /run/ in a forest. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, let's see what we got here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts powerslashing the vines to clear them --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is revealed to show... a large amount of swelling. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oog...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tries to say something, but can't move his mouth... at least he has a new pair of shades on. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  starts trying to pull FL out... ironically, by dragging him with a drawn vine --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is successfully pulled out. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake's <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL'S]</span>  luck stat is equal to... "i" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright, let's get you back to the bar... maybe Adal has something to cure the swelling...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  flips FL onto his still-spacesuited back and starts walking back to the village --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  arrives and heads inside ((==&gt; bar memo)) --</span><br />
