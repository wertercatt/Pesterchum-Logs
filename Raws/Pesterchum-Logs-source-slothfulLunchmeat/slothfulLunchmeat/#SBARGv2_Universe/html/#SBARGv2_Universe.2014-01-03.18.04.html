<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, there's always minecraft. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh boy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (tbh I'm kinda getting sick of minecraft)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it helps if you have a project. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, what would I reasonably make? Lacus City?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Astrum Republic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wherewhat? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well FL, as soon as I finish this thing and build a path between the two netherportals, you'll have ocean access...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kinda doubt I would be able to build the Astrum Republic without creative mode u_u</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it would be a flying city /in the end/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I meant for that underwater thing you wanted to do, but good point I guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats also gonna be hard...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /even in creative/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if only sponges worked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (cough)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, those things from classic creative. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, apparently MCP's finally finished parsing 1.7.2...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, according to the optifine thread, MCP finished doing their thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which means both optifine /and/ spigot should hopefully be updating soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and as soon as they do, I can update the server and make a new /creative mode/ map :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and then I can resume being able to see the sun again! ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...wait where do you build SJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I mean, considering the draw distance stuff ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, in this version, I have it on short, but in the latest version, I can set it to enough chunks so I can see the cool stuff in the sky. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which will get /even cooler/ when you can combine it with Optifine</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah SJ, doesn't OF solve your problem in the current version?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't use optifine. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yes, I know, I'm a horrible noob who should burn in the nether for not using it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm trying to figure out what mods I should use if I host a server...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know I'll use Thaumcraft 4 and Ars Magica 2 for the magic side of things...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...dammit, a major mod is kinda in an experimental state.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, I don't need it /that much/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plenty of other mods to use instead.</span><br />
