<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't know why, but since I had a ton of grist... I decided to make an olympic sized swimming pool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Took a huge amount of time to fill...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seems legit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But after I got the code for a bottomless bottle of water, it worked out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT neuroticVagabond [CNV]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hahahaha that's fucking genius</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, I have a huge room around the fourth gate, that sometimes drops imps into it... I'm ready, I just need to wait... unless you suggest I keep going up to prep everything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Or I could attempt to build sideways to connect to another house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...actually, I'll add more supports.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: samurai sudoku mode GO!!!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ???</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's a word for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now I shouldn't have to worry about that Glitch Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now That I've built... DOWNWARDS&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did I miss something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it melted the supports to my house a while ago... past the second gate, but after that, I've managed to get it back to the way it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...does anyone know how to hack the transportalizers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, it's hard figuring out a safe way down this canyon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was thinking of transforming a meteor into some sort of nexus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a warp zone?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except its not a secret to anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what if the guardian decides to shut it down?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, nobody tells the guardian, or I have start captchaing people to bring them to my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And apparently you guys are terrified of that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparenly you guys are afraid of me accidently holepunching another living lifeform.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not just that, but getting stuck in hammerspace</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, its not that bad in there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just white and empty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And has a decent wifi connection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And kinda extends forever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its a white plain that extends... forever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I kinda like not going insane from sensory deprivation k thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sensory deprivation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is it just the white?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just pull out your laptop and play TF2!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Course, if you do get hole punched, and your code is remembered... you don't come back the same way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There are 2^48 different codes... that isn't enough information to store an entire person's memories...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or even a unique text file.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Honesty, thats only enough for 3 unicode characters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For example, the code for a gecko may be used to make gecko gloves, but if you try to make another gecko it turns out brain damaged.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or, on a lighter note, it cleans clothes, as it doesn't retain the information of the stain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wanna get a transportalizer network set up so we don't need to pick FI up EVERYTIME?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably would be a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: speak of the devil</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gee, that swimming pool sounds like real fun right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe you should do some of your land quests of something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *or</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats a good idea... who wants to join me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ceca54">CURRENT fortuitousSleuth [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  hrm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who wants to join me for some land quests?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm a little busy trying to explore somewhere right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  same, actually about to head out</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll see about joining FS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets see... calculate for glitch clouds...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  only one thing left to do now</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#730e8f">CURRENT fierySwallow [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: there</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...No paths found?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dammit, I hate those glitch clou- AUGH.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: sucks, man</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What the hell!</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: hrm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My house just shook!</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: o.0</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  0.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh my god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not even the dwelling spires are safe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what is happening????</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: everything okay over there?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...It appears a glitch cloud can damage sections of a dwelling spire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll fix it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I'll set up an alarm system on the ground floor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The glitch clouds only seem to turn into clouds when not in a lands gravity.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, they are only really a problem high up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ah man, I just realized what the leaking from above was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My pool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll just patch it up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Never thought I would wreck the plumbing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, did you seriously build your pool that high up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: On an outcropping.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So the main tower section would be unaffected.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm still an idiot, aren't I?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: to a degree, but you're getting wiser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suppose my wisdom increases while I'm learning about the games mechanics...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, once you build past a point, the gravity no longer matters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You can build in any weird direction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its kinda like a space elevator at that point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I do like the tensile strength of the housing material sburb supplies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#39b873">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: any Time players online to check and see if I made any obvious temporal-logic fails? <a href='http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51178224362/stable-time-loop-theory-a-light-players-perspective'>http://creeperpuncher.tumblr.com/post/51178224362/stable-time-loop-theory-a-light-players-perspective</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me check here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wouldn't that just have you posting the same thing as the time hero... at the SAME TIME?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: idk, it was just an idea I had earlier. I've been prone to random thought tangents long before this game started :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmm... so it seems you're trying to map out how to make a closed preventitive timeloop</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: with a distinct lack of doom to cause it</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: yeah, I guess that was kind of it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I made a little machine that only works with stable time loops and information...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You type in a question, and it searches it's databanks for an answer... It gives the answer to you, then the option of sending it back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, you always will send it back, otherwise it is a paradox, and it would have never recieved it... after you check the answer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: it's like the old thought experiment: one chance to open a safe, so you start with combo 00-00-00, and if you fail, you tell your past self to try [code you tried] + 1, and eventually it iterates until "future you tells you the code, it works, so you tell past you the same code"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly... it has some sort of thing to prevent splinter timelines... for example, it might not give you an answer...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which kinda makes it worthless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, who wants to have a party!</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FI, lets take you swimming!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I finally made it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I finally made it to the bottom of the huge freaking hole! :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...hole?</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...nothing. Just an idle thought.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ya need anyhelp?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe a little, but right now I'm mostly just doing some scouting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll tell you guys when I find something interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...kay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF:  Hope you find something... useful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: How the rest of ya folks doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Trying to make a magical computer that turns filesystems into a videogame!</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...why.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, the better question is... why not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ...you're trying to recreate either Tron, ReBoot, or some combo of the two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  has nothing to say about the second one, as he alchemized a Keytool a while ago --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Because there is a high chance that the game will be glitched, and somehow effect SBarg, ending with the FG punching ya in the dick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...I think. Maybe.... well maybe not the last part, but something bad will happne, all da same.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm actually trying to pull a kaiba.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Halo monsters.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: I'm starting to wonder if I need to save up grist to alchemize a Lyoko Tower, so I can "Return to the past now!" when one of you guys timeline-dooms us with your shenanigans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Episode 7 of the abridged series.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, those things would be magnets for the glitch and you know it</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: oh god</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hmm, glitch magnets... to draw the glitch out of the session.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know where I found this skull.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Also, just to let people know, I'm at the astroid field ring thingy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What's going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Time players, now would be a good idea to stop me, if I am gonna mess up.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: please don'τ go τhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: iτ's mosτ likely dangerous.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if you find a note, you should probably read it and follow it</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Gonna Test out some of the mechs I made.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH GOD OUT OF THE SESSION FLEE</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: well, it IS at least better than doing it within the inner orbits of the medium...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: In case of god, nuke them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: wait, space ogres?</span><br />

<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: let's see if I got this right</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: if we're traveling through paradox space</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: we'll not just have to deal with meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: but the space ogres</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the glitch clouds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: AND these wierd glitch cloud things?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *the medium, paradox space refers more to the timespac continuum</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: and The Corrupted... wherever it ended up</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Okay, I just missed with the rocket punch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Guess it's a good thing I finished Unit-0, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: actually isn't furthest ring more the outer rim/the void?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  don't return to the past! --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  better yet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we have the glitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  glitches? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  figures it'll be more of a Doomed Timeline Rewinder without having a specific Time player doing it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  or polymorphic clones? --</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You don't know what all the weapons in the mech /you/ made do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: On the plus side, one space orge is dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Seriously dude?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See if there is a button to kill spy imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well... kind of. I know what they SHOULD do but... well, this one was made with Mega XLR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: be careful what you P.O.K.E. out of the session... we still don't know if ectobiolobabbies are going to be a thing, and you might end up Furthest Ringing the meteor they're supposed to appear on</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: first... the medium... then... HE WORLD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So you made it with alchemy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ah man...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Sadly, 'save the world' seems to be broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I combined it with Big O for maxium punhyness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Put some tape over "the world" and replace it with "Skaia".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((RS: I actually didn't plan to Return to the Past. it's kinda godmoddingy. but IC I was preparing to, to be safe.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it works, sburb is stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (i was actually just being silly in semi-ooc don't mind it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If not, at least reality still makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...lets try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: *BITZT* ajasgfuglaivgfia;sifugyifgae.l;oijgophouabhsufi;gluvqwnfqpoje.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ....</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: FL, you'd make a good Foundation researcher. your "who gives a fuck" attitude about potential catastrophies is awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What the hell happened to ya FF?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (its cool)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: the timeball is self-aware, because if it says "ok" and we ignore FF, he'll stop being ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: so a vague answer is the most temporally safe, I think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not gonna lie gonna be a little miffed if I can't even do anything with the Alt after all that work on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: actually, I've tasted blue before. there's a certain flavor of mountain dew that actually tastes like the color blue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've managed to taste lightning before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...It tastes like batterys.</span><br />
