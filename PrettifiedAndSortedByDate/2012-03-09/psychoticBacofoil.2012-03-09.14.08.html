<span style="color:#646464">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> began pestering psychoticBacofoil <span style="color:#000000">[PB]</span> at 14:08 --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: HA! TAKE THAT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Oh hai FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: IM ALIVE, sucker!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: No,no you use Pesterchum, correct?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: A patched version, what of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: It says you are trolling me. You are clearly not you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: the hell?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: damn glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: You are obviously a troll using Trollian for you are trolling me</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: No, here is a screenshot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Instead of pestering me</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: See how that works?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: hold up, imageshack is being an ass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL:  <a href='http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/1115/proofvz.png'>http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/1115/proofvz.png</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Aw, I'm your first friend</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: does that prove that your crocker ware is a glitchy piece of shit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I use Trollian</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: No, stupid compu-</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Not that malware</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Just because I work for her doesn't mean I use her products</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Otherwise I would be saying shit like "To right the countless wrongs of our day, we shine this light of true redemption, that this place may become as paradise. What a wonderful world such would be..."</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Don't mistake me for an idiot</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Oh, so your not imcompetent.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I was the leader of the resistance before</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I fought the Condense and managed to cause some damage</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: The rest of it is shenanigans and bullshit that led me to where I am</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Until she stabbed your brain with that damn fork of hers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I was wearing a box</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: She stabbed that and tried brainwashing me, then LE intervened</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: But it was stuck in this middle space where she was still in my mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So half brainwashed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Was</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I then unbrainwashed myself</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: riiight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Then I ate a cake, which unlocked this: <a href='http://rainbowdash.net/file/alphakirby-20111116T001625-3f9dq6b.gif'>http://rainbowdash.net/file/alphakirby-20111116T001625-3f9dq6b.gif</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: DAMMIT MY EYES CANT LOOK AWAY!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: there we go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: that red X always helps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Then some prick threw a Pillsbury coin at me which led to this: <a href='http://rainbowdash.net/file/alphakirby-20111116T011912-yyb2hyk.gif'>http://rainbowdash.net/file/alphakirby-20111116T011912-yyb2hyk.gif</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Which in turn, unlocked this: <a href='http://rainbowdash.net/file/alphakirby-20111116T012812-nk5mngr.png'>http://rainbowdash.net/file/alphakirby-20111116T012812-nk5mngr.png</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: yeah yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I get it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Any questions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have already been told my session was doomed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: sorry, is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: That's because it was a pirated copy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: stupid timeline shinnigans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Do not download Sburb from any source besides Skaianet</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: You should know that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, we must be in seperate timelines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I do believe we are in the same timeline and you just didn't realize it</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: You honestly thought the Condense created Sburb?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Then why did you download the .zip?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I KNOW that she had stolen the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: But it was still pirated and pirated copies are always doomed</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah, guy said skaia wasn't there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: That my planet was floating in nothingness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: The worst that happened with my session was interdimensional shenanigans</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: 4 different dimensions with one player from each to be specific</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: and my server player has no arms</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: But yeah, that sucks man</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: It did generate imps though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Is it mean to laugh about that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So apparently I'll have some means of getting food until help arives from outside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Well depending on how broken your session is, it may be linked to others</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: It may help your hope that I'm a Seer of Void</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I think I majorly broke it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Seriously, would it have killed you to wait for the envelopes to arrive in the mail</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I didn't prototype, and I used two computers to get in, according to the guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Oh wait, is the host the one that controls your shit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Because that's what I meant</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: My server player is just a pony</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: My HOST player has no arms</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And now apparently I am going to launch it up soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I better start.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Also yes, trying to be your own host and not prototyping are easy ways to fuck up everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I personally fight rock salt dragon imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Not counting the stuff the others prototyped</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: After mulling it over, I'm just gonna launch the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: THANKS FOR THE INFO!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Best of luck to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Don't die on me. ;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Are you on my side or hers? Im getting confused her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: here*</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: I'm on whatever side I feel like</span><br />
<span style="color:#9e0000">PB: Like I said, I have free will and shit</span><br />
