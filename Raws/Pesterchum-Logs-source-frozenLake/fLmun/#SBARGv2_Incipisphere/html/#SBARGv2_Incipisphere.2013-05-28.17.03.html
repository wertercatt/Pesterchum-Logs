<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It was... all happy and giggly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ITS OVER 8000!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god pinkie pie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...over 413,612 you mean &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Not even.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It was psychopathic happy not overly excited.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: PINKIE PIE DEFYS ALL LAWS OF PHYSICS-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It didn't even resemble a pony.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dwarf Fortress?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So I think the secret passage might have to do with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: wαs it a fucking trickster?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't know, possibly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: It could be...Ushiromiya Maria.......</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Your straying from the point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ((afk for reals))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...I know SOMEONE threw in a T!mutie plush/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that was MG...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: trickster mutie? oh frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The point is that whatever's doing it might be in that passage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And it may be able to affect ALL the imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Not just that one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...touhou?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what were we even thinking when we were prototyping?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: FUCKING STOP GUESSING!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I AM ALMOST SURE IT WASN'T ANYTHING PROTOTYPED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I needed to prototype /something/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I prototyped cruxite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Are you going to come and help investigate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The imp was trapped outside of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not yelling at you, yours porbably was opne of the least harmful right next to chocolate</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: And the Battlepen barely defeated it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: i αm staying the fuck away from that trickster shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You sure it was an Imp?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: So imagine something farther inside of the passage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, check the body.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't know what it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might have gotten a weapon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I can only guess that it was an imp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The body is under a pile of rubble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...might be ya Dezien.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: effecting ya imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: THEN COME HELP ME!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: If its the denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: then there is a denizen under my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I need help to stop it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Did ya fight ya dezien ye, or no?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It is still under the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: But it might attack at any time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't even know that it IS</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: a denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It could be something WORSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I bet the underling was a lich.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: you αre so fucked if it is your denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: jst wondering, what kinda professions did your parents used to have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I still don't know that it was a common underling, if it even was an underling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: I've lived with my sister.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually, I'm pretty sure the denizen lair only spawns in an area far away from the dwelling spire (like, in the southern hemisphere if the spire is considered the land's north pole)...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: then... what was it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so what you saw was probably some kinda underling, but with shithive-maggots stats</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: oh god oh god oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It must be a new archtype</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I've met a lich queen...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You may need to upgrade your stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: What could I prototype at this point?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: The battle pen is made of an artifact I stole from denizen accultists.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Scribblenauts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: It cost a shit ton of grist. I stole most of it from SA.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...who was SA agai-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: player death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: the one I prototyped.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Where is he anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: He went back in time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh, that may have been hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Uh, like I said, we pulled a different approach, as that would have caused a doomed timeline... he got eaten by a glitch instead. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((well too late now, I guess the person I believe to be the owner knows, I think.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...uh... should I should I not send my sprite to the FG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If he needs power, I can give him the Mr Fusion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: HE IS NOT GOING TO GET MY SPRITE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He, she, it, whatever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((lets just say that he is from a doomed timeline))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((and I'm pretty sure FG is a girl, at least in the fanart on that one site thingy))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Could just have the hair. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#c1bb10">CURRENT courageousScribe [CCS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I just thought of this but what would happen if two people with only one teir prototyping fused their sprites together by prototyping one into the other?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( BISHI. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Anyway, I sealed it off temporarily.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CS, you are an idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ..Yeah. I'm worried he's goingto turn the sprites into a powersource.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: am I?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: But at some point i'll need your help...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ... I say try it, CSS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: or am i just curious about the outcomes of anything\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would obviously begin to prototype everything it touches, and pull stuff in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: BLACK HOLE KERNEL SPRITE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah^</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: remember in homestuck when Caliborn entered?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually FL, that was jossed. Caliborn didn't have a KernelspriteDivideByZeroException, it was ONE sprite that became a black hole</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EVERY IMP CAN PROTOTYPE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Either way, it ends the world.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: generally a bad idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((I was thinking the underling under the house was one of the misc. ones that John defeated in cascade))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Considering FL almost got killed by a lich queen, I doubt it. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((doesn't matter at the moment, I guess.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Tired...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: gonna nap now.</span><br />
