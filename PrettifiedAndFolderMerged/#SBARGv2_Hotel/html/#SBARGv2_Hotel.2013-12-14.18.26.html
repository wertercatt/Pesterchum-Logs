The "Starmage" was somewhat confused, and the captain decided to well... shoot at it. Somehow, it blocked our incoming attacks like nothing, and then... it sent out a pulse, which knocked most of the crew unconsious. I managed to hang on as the ship got pulled into the ring... when we got to the otherside, the crew seemed to have been microwaved, and I was the only one left."</span><br />
