[10:07:02] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: 'twas a joke</span><br />
[10:07:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah, remove the point from it, and convert the decimal to hexadecimal.</span><br />
[10:07:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :P</span><br />

[11:13:23] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: what happend?</span><br />
[11:13:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sendificator shenanigans</span><br />
[11:13:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't come over</span><br />
[11:15:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I can fix this</span><br />
[11:18:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, how are you doing?</span><br />
[11:18:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The box isn't too small, right?</span><br />

[11:18:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also what happened to you?</span><br />
[11:18:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay thank god</span><br />
[11:18:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so its just a one time glitch maybe</span><br />
[11:19:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why, what happened?</span><br />
[11:19:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: did the boxes spontaniously shrink or something?</span><br />
[11:20:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: um no</span><br />
[11:20:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: infact from my perspective you could say they are massive</span><br />
[11:21:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...uh...</span><br />
[11:23:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay, my other guess is that /you/ accidentally shrunk yourself.</span><br />
[11:24:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ding ding ding</span><br />
[11:24:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and uh</span><br />
[11:25:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm worried about what would happen if Lucky Mallet was used on me.</span><br />
[11:25:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since it wasn't caused by one.</span><br />
[11:25:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't wanna become issun sized to issun</span><br />
[11:26:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...great. so what do we do then?</span><br />
[11:26:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and what were you doing standing on the sendificator pad anyway?</span><br />
[11:28:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets not ask silly questions like that</span><br />
[11:30:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, what /do/ you want to try? the Resizing Funnel, since you apparently made it at one time?</span><br />
[11:30:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't want the cockroach incident again</span><br />
[11:32:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. right.</span><br />
[11:33:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well anyway, should I come over so we can at least figure things out in person?</span><br />
[11:37:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sure let me deactivate the security again</span><br />
[11:37:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, was that you that just warped in?</span><br />
[11:38:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...no?</span><br />
[11:38:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: BH?</span><br />
[11:38:18] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: yes?</span><br />
[11:38:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: did you or one of your friends warp into my house just now?</span><br />
[11:38:41] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: no?</span><br />
[11:38:48] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: though I did just have an idea. lemme get a thing and I'll be over.</span><br />
[11:39:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well fuck we have an intruder</span><br />
[11:39:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: lets see if I can trace where the teleport came fro-</span><br />
[11:39:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: WHAT THE FUCK</span><br />
[11:39:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, major intruder alert.</span><br />
[11:39:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: from /another galaxy/</span><br />
[11:39:54] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: wait what?</span><br />
[11:40:07] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: jesus when is AC going to go back in time?!</span><br />
[11:41:09] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shit the bed what</span><br />
[11:41:12] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: if he appears on his own birthday i'm calling bullshit</span><br />
[11:41:32] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: wait</span><br />
[11:41:35] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: I saw someone earlier FL</span><br />
[11:41:39] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: what do they look like?</span><br />
[11:41:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know, the cameras are offline</span><br />
[11:42:01] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: oh jeez</span><br />
[11:42:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I think I saw a flash of cyan</span><br />
[11:42:14] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: it was some guy with a mask</span><br />
[11:42:30] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: but I don't think they weren't wearing anything cyan, thats for sure</span><br />
[11:42:35] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: *were</span><br />
[11:43:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'm bringing over the Reversible Changing Chopsticks... they're the thing that lets Issun become /human-sized/, so it should solve your problem FL...</span><br />
[11:43:43] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: CP</span><br />
[11:43:52] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: that sounds like the spoon from kerero gunso</span><br />

[11:44:41] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: because the frogs make a spoon that does size altering</span><br />
[11:44:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's actually a Xiaolin Showdown thing I did some alchemy on</span><br />
[11:44:46] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: oh</span><br />
[11:44:51] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: used to love that show</span><br />
[11:47:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, status report!</span><br />
[11:48:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You are my eyes and ears!</span><br />
[11:48:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... things are exploded.</span><br />
[11:48:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, its not moving torwards me if the pattern of the destruction of cameras matches up</span><br />
[11:48:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its moving torwards... well fuck.</span><br />
[11:48:53] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...towards me?</span><br />
[11:49:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, CP, how much do you like the internet?</span><br />
[11:49:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
[11:49:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its going after the alchemized ring server</span><br />
[11:49:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh frogs</span><br />
[11:49:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well it is creating a major source of quantum disturbance.</span><br />
[11:50:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so that might be why it came here.</span><br />
[11:50:25] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: shall I make my way over?</span><br />
[11:50:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, get me out of here.</span><br />
[11:50:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I'm at the point where HR and I accidentally your glass door yesterday. how do I get to the server room from here? or better yet, where are /you/ at?</span><br />
[11:50:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll send out the robotic drones to hold it off.</span><br />
[11:51:11] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: I'm heading over</span><br />
[11:51:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, two forwards and a right.</span><br />
[11:51:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: gotcha</span><br />
[11:52:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you right outside the door?</span><br />
[11:52:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah</span><br />
[11:54:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...CP, can you hear me?</span><br />
[11:55:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, hear /and/ see you.</span><br />
[11:57:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then why aren't you answering me!</span><br />
[11:58:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sorry...</span><br />
[11:58:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also holy shit are you guys loud</span><br />

[12:11:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know what hes about to do!</span><br />
[12:18:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, we need to regroup!</span><br />

[12:20:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: some weird Sanic thing trying to break FL's Ring Server...</span><br />

[12:20:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course races from my subconsious are going to show up.</span><br />
[12:20:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I didn't expect this.</span><br />
[12:21:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DAMMIT BH STOP!</span><br />
[12:21:33] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: wait what?</span><br />
[12:21:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We need to think about this.</span><br />
[12:22:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The air vents don't lead all the way to the server, we can head him off.</span><br />
[12:22:10] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: so if its a sanic</span><br />
[12:22:19] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: oh nice</span><br />
[12:22:29] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: let me void up a cage for this asshole real quick</span><br />
[12:22:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But first, we should send CP in alone.</span><br />
[12:22:45] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: grooooan</span><br />
[12:22:47] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: whatever</span><br />
[12:22:54] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: still making a cage</span><br />
[12:22:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The hedgehogs hatred seems to be directed to humans.</span><br />
[12:22:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, okay?</span><br />
[12:23:09] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: and me</span><br />
[12:23:15] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: seriously it was like it was targetting me</span><br />
[12:23:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And CP comes across close enough to a Mobian that he might think he is a slave or something</span><br />
[12:23:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh wait, just had an idea. but FL, I'm gonna have to set you on a table first...</span><br />
[12:24:02] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: table you say?</span><br />
[12:24:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: under threat of being robotized.</span><br />
[12:24:16] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: oh my god</span><br />
[12:24:25] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: ignorance is no excuse</span><br />
[12:24:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know what he would want, but we should send CP in to gather information.</span><br />
[12:24:52] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: damn vigilantes</span><br />
[12:25:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course this issue is made worse considering it seems to be one of /my fan characters that I designed/</span><br />
[12:25:41] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: wait what?!</span><br />
[12:25:43] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: FL</span><br />
[12:25:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But there might be several differences.</span><br />
[12:25:49] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: don't you know better</span><br />
[12:25:59] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: it looks like some kind of re-color...</span><br />
[12:26:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: /what/.</span><br />
[12:26:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, I know a few things.</span><br />
[12:26:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He is rather adept at swimming, and can preform the spin dash and spin attacks.</span><br />
[12:26:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is also quite likely that his weaponry is powered by Chaos Drives.</span><br />
[12:27:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And considering they contain power collected from chaos emeralds, it is likely if he has enough, he can simulate the effects of the fake emerald in Sonic Adventure 2.</span><br />
[12:28:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it would likely take seven to match it though.</span><br />
[12:28:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And if he has enough... well, thats how I knew the super form was coming.</span><br />
[12:28:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes...</span><br />
[12:28:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, due to the fact the power is limited, he would not be able to maintain it for any period of time.</span><br />
[12:29:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it is likely he will be rather drained when it ends, if it hasn't already.</span><br />
[12:29:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That escape into the airvent might have been an attempt to give him enough time to rest.</span><br />
[12:30:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Camera right outside of the Server Chamber has been destroyed.</span><br />
[12:31:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, you should arrive shortly.</span><br />
[12:31:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok</span><br />
[12:32:36] <span style="color:#c50000">CBH: tell me when I should go over there ima go eat</span><br />

[01:00:25] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I would assume that not all are asshats</span><br />

[01:03:28] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: how did they even get here?</span><br />
[01:03:35] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: I say we cloak this planet or something</span><br />
[01:03:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it just teleported all the way from another galaxy and it managed to find us, I don't think we should be too worried about that.</span><br />
[01:04:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh. Teleportation is one thing.</span><br />
[01:04:42] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Being able to create other useful stuff out of any matter around is a very different thing.</span><br />

[01:30:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: after all they managed to find the planet due to the massive energy use we have been using</span><br />

[01:56:44] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: This was not something I wanted to be an issue today.</span><br />
[01:57:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "hey I'm going to investigate those man made signals."</span><br />
[01:57:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *ten days later*</span><br />
[01:57:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "turns out there was nothing there, and all those man made signals were a fluke even though they are obviously man made"</span><br />
[01:58:03] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: did you even listen to what EQ just said</span><br />
[01:58:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I DID</span><br />
[01:58:10] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: if she bullshits memories</span><br />
[01:58:13] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: that isn't an issue even</span><br />
[01:58:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AND IF THE MEMORIES DON'T MATCH UP WITH REALITY SOMEONE WILL FIND OUT</span><br />
[01:58:41] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: hmmm</span><br />
[01:58:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AUGH WHY IS EVERYONE FUCKING IDIOTS</span><br />
[01:58:47] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: she could tell them it was a sun?</span><br />
[01:58:54] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL, I believe you're the idiot here</span><br />
[01:58:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh sure, a sun can create youtube</span><br />
[01:59:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that is watchable from /the other end of the universe/</span><br />
[01:59:14] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: if they're here because its an energy source</span><br />
[01:59:18] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You are the one who let the person from deep space near to our tech and then set them free again, FL.</span><br />
[01:59:21] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: why don'τ we void τhe damn energy source</span><br />
[01:59:23] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: how is that even a thing</span><br />
[01:59:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: nh mjnnnhybbbg</span><br />
[02:00:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: rlvhshbhbbhalhsblhnbgbsngbnhfs;ibgfhligbhfdabfad;vihbfdgvraeihuralbv</span><br />

[02:00:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you know what?</span><br />
[02:00:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: fine.</span><br />
[02:02:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll let you all handle explaining with false memories how a sun /came out of nowhere/, how this place is making internet, and how come people decide a blue dwarf isn't interesting</span><br />
[02:02:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: good luck</span><br />
[02:02:48] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: except</span><br />
[02:02:51] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: you let him get away</span><br />
[02:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GOOD LUCK</span><br />
[02:03:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all you can wipe the memories of an entire race, right?</span><br />
[02:03:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /RIGHT/?!</span><br />
[02:03:32] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL calm yourself'</span><br />
[02:04:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: HOW CAN I FUCKING CALM MYSELF WHEN PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME IDIOTS WHEN I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT SEES THE FUCKING ISSUE HERE</span><br />
[02:04:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ASFDSKUGUGUHLRI</span><br />
[02:04:25] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: maybe the fact that YOU'RE the one who can't see the issue</span><br />
[02:04:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should just nuke the planet</span><br />
[02:04:49] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Holy shit okay: I'm going to leave and deal with a personal project. You all can bicker about this all you want.</span><br />
[02:04:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: then they would find nothing</span><br />
[02:05:04] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL</span><br />
[02:05:12] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: please cease</span><br />
[02:05:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hell it would be /less suspicious/ if the quantum signature just stopped</span><br />
[02:05:45] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: thats stupid</span><br />
[02:05:48] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: no it wouldn't</span><br />
[02:05:56] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: if it stopped they would KNOW something was up</span><br />
[02:06:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh like they don't already</span><br />
[02:06:17] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: they'd send people here</span><br />
[02:06:25] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: when they saw nothing</span><br />
[02:06:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah!</span><br />
[02:06:35] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: they'd assume it was the native humans or a planet near hear</span><br />
[02:06:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THATS WHAT I'M TELLING YOU</span><br />
[02:06:51] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: and they'd attack and start a war</span><br />
[02:06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If they come here and find nothing even though the quantum signal is RIGHT HERE</span><br />
[02:07:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you know what?</span><br />
[02:07:05] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: plus</span><br />
[02:07:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fuck this.</span><br />
[02:07:13] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: you realize that we aren't the only ones living here right?</span><br />
[02:07:19] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: there are plenty of mortals on this planet</span><br />
[02:07:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you wanna talk like an intelegent person pester me</span><br />
[02:07:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but if you think mind wiping like that is going to work</span><br />
[02:07:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well then your a bigger idiot than me</span><br />
[02:07:53] <span style="color:#ff8c00">CFD: FL</span><br />
