[01:00:50] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Aw</span><br />
[01:01:07] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think its because i just dont like the atmosphere as much?</span><br />

[01:01:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and mother 3 is much more... grounded, i guess you would say</span><br />
[01:02:09] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Heh</span><br />
[01:02:35] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: which i see what they were going for</span><br />

[01:05:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: including ocs</span><br />
[01:05:47] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: That would be cool</span><br />
[01:06:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: though wed need to have some sort of bar to entry so we dont have a million 11-year-olds being goku and shadow the hedgehog</span><br />
[01:06:47] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Yeah</span><br />
[01:07:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i also had the idea of multiple gms who each sort of run a series or universe</span><br />
[01:07:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The character I would pick is too weak outside of his jet</span><br />
[01:07:30] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Ooo</span><br />
[01:07:30] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so like id probably apply for ghosts n goblins and bionic commando gming</span><br />
[01:07:30] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: That sounds really cool</span><br />
[01:07:30] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and maybe castlevania</span><br />
[01:07:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /Ikaruga bitches/</span><br />
[01:07:52] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: there was never any canon evidence captain falcon could set his fists on fire</span><br />
[01:08:03] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah with the gm thing</span><br />
[01:08:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: like if i were the castlevania gm</span><br />
[01:08:18] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and somebody decided to do an rp in dracula's castle</span><br />
[01:08:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: then i would be called in as the series expert so to speak</span><br />
[01:08:32] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Or in New Pork City</span><br />
[01:09:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fun fact: there is a lockbox in my room containing my controlled substance prescription meds and my copy of earthbound</span><br />

[01:10:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe*</span><br />
[01:10:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I could pick sanic</span><br />

[01:10:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: another thing is that since ocs are allowed</span><br />
[01:10:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /swim/</span><br />
[01:10:55] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: people could import their sbarg characters</span><br />
[01:11:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: tails can swim in the 2d games</span><br />
[01:11:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Knuckles could swim in Adventure 2.</span><br />
[01:11:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Big has that life preserver</span><br />
[01:11:29] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Omg big</span><br />
[01:11:34] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: I loved big</span><br />

[01:11:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Best way to deal with big</span><br />
[01:11:47] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...ecco the dolphin for ssb4</span><br />
[01:11:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: paste duke nukems voice on him</span><br />
[01:11:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and its also canon</span><br />
[01:11:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since</span><br />
[01:12:00] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Omfg</span><br />
[01:12:00] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: big was fucking badass in chronicles</span><br />
[01:12:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the voice actor is the same</span><br />
[01:12:11] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: I forgot</span><br />
[01:12:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously I have all these Headcanons about sonic</span><br />
[01:12:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like</span><br />
[01:12:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eggman is a human brain imported android</span><br />
[01:12:46] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Wh</span><br />
[01:12:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which explains why he can outrun sonic</span><br />
[01:13:00] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Holy shit</span><br />
[01:13:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for short distances</span><br />
[01:13:03] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: anybody here read legends of localization?</span><br />
[01:13:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and he actually uses a backup body in an adjusted ending from Shadow the hedgehog</span><br />
[01:13:38] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: No</span><br />
[01:13:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: switching to the 06 body</span><br />
[01:13:45] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Holy fuck</span><br />
[01:13:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and hacking into the gun database and finding stuff about light cores</span><br />
[01:14:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but nothing else</span><br />
[01:14:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: since the solaris project fell through</span><br />
[01:14:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: bc they have 2 different articles about eggman</span><br />
[01:14:21] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: Can we do the Ssb thing</span><br />
[01:14:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and how he was dr robitnik in america for a while</span><br />
[01:14:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL:   <a href='http://legendsoflocalization.com/how-dr-robotnik-turns-into-dr-eggman/'>http://legendsoflocalization.com/how-dr-robotnik-turns-into-dr-eggman/</a></span><br />
[01:14:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe, if more than just the 3 of us express interest</span><br />

[01:14:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like</span><br />
[01:15:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A chaos emerald is a large battery</span><br />
[01:15:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that is constantly on a charger</span><br />
[01:15:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: getting chaos energy</span><br />
[01:15:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so do you have any idea where that one chaos emerald in 06 came from</span><br />
[01:15:38] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the one that was in a timeloop</span><br />
[01:16:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which explains why it can have infinite energy, but you still need 7 to go super</span><br />
[01:16:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its the one from sonic the fighters</span><br />
[01:16:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the 8th emerald</span><br />
[01:16:46] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh my god</span><br />
[01:17:04] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the one that dr. robitonic took</span><br />
[01:17:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as you can see, I put alot of thought into this</span><br />
[01:17:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, potentially, one could go super with chaos drives</span><br />
[01:17:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: fun fact: i first played sa2 when i was like 8</span><br />
[01:17:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but it would be incredibly short lived and dangerous</span><br />
[01:17:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: only beat last story like a year or 2 ago</span><br />
[01:17:56] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so how do you explain the super emeralds only showing up once</span><br />
[01:18:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Simple</span><br />
[01:18:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Master Emerald can adjust the flow of energy going to the chaos emeralds</span><br />
[01:18:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: powering them up... or turning them off</span><br />
[01:18:56] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you know what i wish sega would do</span><br />
[01:19:08] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: instead of making up all these unneccesary new sanic characters</span><br />
[01:19:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: try /bringing back some of the old ones/</span><br />
[01:19:20] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: mighty, ray, bark, bean...</span><br />
[01:19:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In my head canon, Big is a bad ass</span><br />
[01:20:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gun gave him a weapon during the events of Shadow</span><br />
[01:20:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and well</span><br />
[01:20:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[01:20:27] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: FIND THE COMPOOTER ROOM</span><br />
[01:20:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, the chaotix searching in Shadow for those discs?</span><br />
[01:20:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so how do you deal with shadow's badly-planned alternate paths series</span><br />
[01:20:45] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: *system</span><br />
[01:20:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Stable time loop made by shadow</span><br />
[01:20:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh</span><br />
[01:21:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I simply ignore all of them, taking elements from all of them</span><br />
[01:21:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like GUN storming Eggman's base with Diablon</span><br />
[01:21:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and killing him</span><br />
[01:21:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but like on the subject of bringing back old characters</span><br />
[01:21:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: causing the 06 body switch</span><br />
[01:22:06] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think that the whole werehog thing would have been easier to swallow if instead of a nonsense transformation thing they had just /had sanic team up with bark the polar bear/</span><br />
[01:22:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the gunplay of shadow could easily have been applied to fang the sniper</span><br />
[01:22:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: /nack the weasel</span><br />
[01:22:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly</span><br />
[01:22:41] <span style="color:#990002">CPK: FANG I FUCKIFN LOVED FANG</span><br />
[01:22:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: all of Unleashed is cannon</span><br />
[01:22:42] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i still need to play segasanic</span><br />
[01:22:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: canon*</span><br />
[01:22:52] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: everything but sanic 06 is right</span><br />
[01:22:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
[01:23:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 06 did happen in a way</span><br />
[01:23:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: like i need to get a segasanic arcade machine or find one somewhere</span><br />
[01:23:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: otherwise light cores would not be mentioned</span><br />
[01:23:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah</span><br />
[01:23:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because you /need/ the trackball to play it</span><br />
[01:23:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: it just doesnt work with a keyboard</span><br />
[01:23:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: analog stick</span><br />
[01:23:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that makes trackball spin</span><br />
[01:23:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: virtual trackball at least</span><br />
[01:24:10] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i need to figure out how to make my laptop touchpad usable</span><br />
[01:24:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ray /might/ show up</span><br />
[01:24:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mighty is totally gonna show up</span><br />
[01:24:33] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: in what</span><br />
[01:24:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean</span><br />
[01:24:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: he was in two games</span><br />
[01:24:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: the fanon universe I have planned</span><br />
[01:24:49] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh</span><br />
[01:25:05] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i actually planned out a sanic adventure 3 once</span><br />
