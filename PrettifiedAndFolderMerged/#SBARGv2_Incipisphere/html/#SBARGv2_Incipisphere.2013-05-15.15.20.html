<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: the corruption</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it is here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: We're down the rabbit hole then I guess</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figure thats a term that works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Do you think the glitches are contagious ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I know your code can be deleted by them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If its a glitchy patch of air.</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I think I read about them</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: (( why don't I see the generel memo in the list? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would think the closest thing in reality... would be quark matter.</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I have their names on the tip of my tongue</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I caught a glimpse of a conversation about them</span><br />

<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: Ya I know they where in my and SV's team remember</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: assuming the afterlife isn't glitched augh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They didn't die, their code was erased.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: as in a scratch ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Kinda?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ôô</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Beforus session killed them selves to live on in the afterlife.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But, if your scratched...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its a cessation of existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I always thought the dream bubbles were a sort of purgatory</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: and the real afterlife was after it</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: y'know, the one with Death and board games and tea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I figured problem slueth just took place in a dream bubble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...have you seen what happens when a bubble self tries to leave the dream bubble?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: perhaps Team Sleuth were prospit agents ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: uh... it disintegrates ? it can't ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Its similar to an imaginary self trying to exit through a window.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: skulls yay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and the windows exist here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And now I know how it works.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Team Slueth were exiles who were using the windows to hop into the dream bubbles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It makes so much sense I wonder why you even asked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: well with the asspects now active, the dream bubbles might apear more offten as we are bound to have some mind players in our midst</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: my theory up until now is that the Imaginary City was a dream bubble and the Real City was Prospit and they were locked in</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: *was</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: and what we weren't shown... is the city's color</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it's actually prospit /in the past/</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: &lt;_&lt; &gt;_&gt; v_v ok forget anything i said this is stupid</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But they weren't wearing the uniforms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: no prototypes yet ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: or wierd plot shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, there is still coloration... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me check.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: makes me remember about that shitty thing I drew when I was bored and had that theory</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah nice find</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: is there a list of player prototypes ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: *(( ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yes, but I don't recall the link.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It only posts the pre entry ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you want to submit a prototype, here.</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: nvm I just found it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: link?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: but thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: er I mean that one</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: but without your link</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I just didn't look hard enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you have a link to the list itself?</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((that's because I honestly still /have no idea/ what I prototyped))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((although I have thought of a few things))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was the one that prototyped the cruxite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: you</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: wha</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: how</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: why</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I didn't have time to prototype anything else!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I ONLY HAD 16 SECONDS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: and then we complain about glitches :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ah well</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I barely had time to make my entry item, let alone prototype!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But Cruxitebuddysprite is awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Buddy was one of my dogs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: Aw</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You know, it KINDA SUCKS how everyone we knew more than a year ago is now dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: yeah D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: it's already been a year ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: oh right, the flow of time i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there apparently was a previous session... that we forgot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: I... have this vague idea of seeing a newspaper announcing meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Supposedly I was the lord of blood... weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: but my brain tells me nothing happened that day</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: there was a session ? was it retconned ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And in that one, I prototyped a perfectly generic object.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And more like scratched.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: you have a thing with personalityless prototyping do you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: just imagine, perfectlygenericobjectcruxitesprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: most boring sprite ever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, I use pointless first prototypes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((anyway. do you think a goomba plushie (pre-entry) and a 3D globe map of constellations would be interesting ? Goombastronomersprite ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Hey, there is a pattern to prototype stupid things... like hard games. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( SPY IMPS.</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((oh lol "let's prototype Dark Souls"))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( 29. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( That was the example. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((oh shit really))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Prototype a snake... or something. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I was thinking about something plausible but not mundane))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((nothing out of the ordinary))</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((eh, a dog))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but it's pretty average))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...no fish? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((nah))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((could've been interesting))</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I think we are in agreement))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( wait, make it a baker hat. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( So the sprite can cook. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Instead of being made of bread. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( DO IT. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but honestly all these things don't sound as much fun as a baguette sprite. throw in a goomba plushie y/n))</span><br />

<span style="color:#15baaf">CAA: ((Ill explain on the main memo))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nothing much at the moment</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((so I finally found myself a prototyped sprite))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((i had no idea what it'd be up until now))</span><br />
<span style="color:#15baaf">CAA: Okay. ^_^</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((also is it okay if I disregard my "canon" aspect for one I find more fitting))</span><br />

<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (why the fuck not)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((because dunno))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (guardian took so damn long to get to this way past people probably already did stuff with one aspect or another in mind)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (so for guardian to throw a spider puzzle at you then give you /rage/ is just)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (fuck that noise right?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (fuck it long and fuck it hard)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (ah right)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (you just kept getting rage ?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (just the first time)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (rerolled)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (until i got mind)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (spent a saturday trying to see it right, failed)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (might try again later)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (icy)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (might not)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: (are there a lot of Mind players ?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (don't really think so?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((a handful, but not too many))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (not too sure on the general distribution but i think its pretty even)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah, good.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((when I checked out the first SBARG thing it rolled me Mind IIRC))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but I don't remember what class))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((Page seems to fit I think))</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (class hasn't shown up yet for probably best to leave it for the moment)</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: (iunno)</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah right))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but I think I'll use Page if we need classes. it implies the player lacks part of the aspect in the first place ; it's associated with putting thoughts in action and I have a lot of trouble doing just that))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((plus weaponizing an aspect is awesome))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know, after all this studying, I've come to a conclusion: Paradox space is held together by pretty much nothing but bootstraps and duct tape.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's kinda weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SBURB runs on ~ATH, we managed to DDOS it, and there are glitchly masses that will kill you floating in space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: glitchy*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, more like cessation of existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you get the idea.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I don't think it was this bad before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Chances are its mostly the glitch that's causing the worse of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: As for the rest of it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which I assume we caused.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: By DDOSing Sburb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With Rapid entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...Paradox Space isn't held together by duct tape and bootstraps, Sburb is just coded like a piece of shit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Anyway, do you think you could get me a captcharoid of the White Queen's Sorbet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, does anyone have the codes for the sburb kitchen gear?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...also, Double carving is a waste of time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...is anyone still there?</span><br />
