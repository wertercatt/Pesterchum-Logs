<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I kind of think he can help us </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: if we can get rid of his bad blood</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: hm... I'm not sure it'll be that easy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Denizens are THOUGH, and I'm betting not all are as open minded as athena. Plus the glitch is affecting them as well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I feel like i'm not meant to defeat him though</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: how would I go about doing it if i did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Well, you could either go with "the choice" or fight it to the death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: When I met athena, I went with the choice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess i'll know when I get there</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Many fought, and almost died, appearently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: I guess so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: if we can gather them through diplomacy, I think we can use them </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: my denizen was too sick from being weighed down by glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: that sucks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: What did you do then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT billiardHounds <span style="color:#ff0000">[CBH]</span>  sees an imp trap in ice --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I had to put him out of his misery. I didn't even want to, but it was either that or he'd get possesed by glitches.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: That sounds terrible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: I'm... sorry to hear that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I feel like the Glitch serves a purpose</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what kind?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: ... really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think that it has something to do with our destiny to make a new universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: uh huh... </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: A challenge created by our Gaurdian or by the session itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: or maybe both!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: one heck of a challenge, if you ask me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The gaurdian has high hopes</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: indeed. Not very fair.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think he has a plan for the new universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and that this is his way of testing whether or not we will be able to follow through with his plan</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and on skaia's side</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think Skaia created it to serve as a challenge to test if we are really worthy of the Ultimate Reward</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe an update of the original game</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's kinda weird, but at the same time, it seems to sorta make sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: well, im not sure about that. The FG is trying to fix the glitch right now, with little reward. Skaia being involved with the glitch... I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Its only a guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: fair enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: But I think that the glitch serves as more than just something to impeed our success</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: humph, I would like to see that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Maybe our Ultimate Reward is different</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe its more potent</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and skaia is testing if we have the benevolence and focus to succeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: benevolence, in being able to put a Denizen out of its misery</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: focus is attempting to find ways to stop the forces that impeed us</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The glitch is a test of our minds and our skill.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: atleast thats what I thiknk</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: ... BH. I love where this is going, but... I warn you to not set your hopes too high. We have no idea how this will all turn out... We really cant predict what can happen. We can't even know if this is intentional or not.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: quite a while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: still no imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but look up and foward</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the real treasure is near by, or so the consort told me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: he said that when we see the serpents figure</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: to pierce the ground below us.</span><br />
