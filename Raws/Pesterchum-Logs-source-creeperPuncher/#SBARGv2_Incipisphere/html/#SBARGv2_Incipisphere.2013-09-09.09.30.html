<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what's the hmph about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, nothing. Just me agreeing with the previous statement.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: cool. i'm certain as a denizen and as a representation of Athena you would know that words work better as opposed to onamatapeic statements</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Heheheh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but that could just be me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: Oh, fair enough. 'Blame me for being a slightly tired.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're a denizen</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: :I</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they wait hundreds of years as our session to come to fruit and for us to enter</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but apparently they get a little tired.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Yeah, I mean, they have a home and stuff while they wait.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he sounds like a handfull.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: He's actually kinda fun to be around! He messed me up a few times, but we have prank wars, eating contests, we spar...</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Heck, today I was engrossed in a peach battle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm surprised at how much more lively the denizens here are.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: much less of the mini-boss before the final boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and more of</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'll probably just end up killing mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Maybe I should bring him by the BaCafe sometime. He's kinda curious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: Well, most Denizens are meant to be killed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe7b1a">CPO: So, yeah, do what you gotta.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh no</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: make no mistake</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh, that would be kinda interesting to meet your denizen, PO...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there's a choice in the actions we take. no different in letting him live or die.</span><br />
