[11:18:44] <span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: it's fine</span><br />
[11:19:06] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think I had really weird dreams a few years back, or at least relatively consistant ones in their oddity.</span><br />
[11:19:11] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Trains and falling.</span><br />
[11:19:32] SA: ugh. all this didn't start happening until several days ago.<br />

[11:20:21] <span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: by !ike magic or something</span><br />
[11:20:21] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And invariably I'd just fall off, end up falling for what seemed like ever.</span><br />
[11:20:27] <span style="color:#33dd00">CLL: and I cou!dn't see who it was</span><br />
[11:21:47] SA: also the mastermind was forcing everyone to put on a performance in front of an audience in a grand mockery of the trial and everyone was alive<br />
[11:22:08] SA: only for them to announce how each died and they died again<br />
[11:22:28] SA: i think i ran her over with a train.<br />
[11:22:56] SA puts hands to face and lies down<br />

[11:40:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not that it's like a pile of random polygon glitches, I just mean that there is literally no pattern to my dreams, except a high "why the fuck?" factor...</span><br />

[11:41:27] seems to be the same with me<br />
[11:43:48] i don't usually remember dreaming at all, mostly a blank white/dark haze<br />
[11:44:16] I get like two to three hours sleep, fuck if I know what I do then.<br />
