<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they'd have to be fairly simple AU's probably... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: take a walk in a park</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the fastest method. And the AU's have to be from as large of a bank as possible.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: -.-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we are going to be dealing with /alot/ of AUs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ranging from Legend of Zelda to Doki Doki Panic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might be able to get us an edge though, using some of the code structs I used to get the stuff exported to the replicator.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Our first AU should put us half way down the road.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: which one did you have in mind? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I did the calculations with a few, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Megaman, and even /Digimon/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we could start with anything, really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: there, updated news</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nothing is going to magically put us 90% of the way down the road or anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: digimon and megaman would be cool ironic ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, maybe we could start out with something easyish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like taking down an invasion of demons from hell.</span><br />

<span style="color:#722881">CAS: &gt;&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: or digimon</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was gonna suggest Green greens from Kirby's Dream Land ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: with little helpers</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it would provide us with sutitable weaponry for further AUs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((totally gonna plan out a green greens AU adaption))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, you do realize we would need to take down an eldrich demon if we did a Kirby AU, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even if it's just one level? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and if we remove kirby from the level? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we did one of that length, we wouldn't be able to inject much code at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though it might be fun ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Something of short length might be a wise idea though... but it would have to have detail for it to work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: well you guys work on that</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: tell me when AU is okey dokey</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a DS cartridge of Kirby Super Star Ultra that could be used. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a few computer games that could be used.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly fangames.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mostly /sonic/ fangames.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and official sonic games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, we could do alot of classic sonic based AUs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we wouldn't get much of an advantage on further AU's from that one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We could try Minecraft as an AU, but that would be... tricky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since the end of the loop varies when it comes to Minecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Be it entering the nether, defeating the ender dragon, or spawning and killing the wither.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, if we loaded up modded Minecraft into the AU Machine, we would have alot of stuff to be able to use in future AUs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ranging from nukes to magical swords.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I still think we should try to keep it simple. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we can build up crazy virtual superweapons gradually or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, what would /you/ like to start with?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hmmm... let's see here... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we could start out with a Mario Kart AU, using the figure 8 track from Mario Kart DS. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the goal would be pretty easy: just make sure one of us gets 1st place after 3 laps. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what would be be able to pick up from the AU for further ones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we be*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we could pick up some of the item box items. Red shell, green shell, blue shell, bullet bill... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I /guess/ we could pick up the kart-</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay you have a point</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we just have to remember not to take any weird detours. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (I'm sure you remember last time we all played mario kart) ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (yeah)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We should actually do the Mario Kart 7 stuff so we have a method of flight in the AUs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: never played that one.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since I can't exactly get powers to stay on reliably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, in 7, the karts have hanggliders on them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: any other major differences? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It has a few extra items.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fire Flower, Super Leaf, and Lucky Sevens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus you can build your own kart kinda</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: osunds pretty cool. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, we could also try sonic riders. :V</span><br />

<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: You don't know, and neither it seems, are you able to do anything about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... I'm a failure of a 2nd in command, am I? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not that Team Spectrum is even really a thing anymore. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: We all fail at things</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I failed the entire game</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: she blamed her problems on the sylph of doom and the raven of space, but I think it may have been more than just their atttitudes towards her. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the Sylph pretty much declaired himself the leader of our session, until he pretty much went mad with power and whatever. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually he flew into the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span> and  was never heard from or seen again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Blue Hole?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kind of like a black hole, but made of glitches. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....I see</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: after that, there wasn't any sort of actual player leader. we tried to elect one, but it ended in anarchy and disaster. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Sounds about right</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but the main thing Kat disliked about the sylph besides his stupid charisma was how he was so manipulative and even took over her job as the healer somehow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Understandable</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: later on, there was something when FL wound up dying due to preforming a completely unnessisary chaos dunk. She said with my help we could have revived him using a special Time/Life fraymotif, but because the raven of space called in a maid of life, who didn't even like FL or even want to revive him at all, she fled the scene and I think she felt betrayed or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I both do and do not understand that situation</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was complicated, yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL wound up reviving due to a 3rd option involving a microchip implant. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: when all the players remianing from our session entered this universe, the raven of space and the maid of space somehow created Starter Planet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was to be our new home ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but cabin fever set in quickly, especially with the winter weather. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: for a time things seemed alright ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but at some hoint, she just sort of... collapsed into hatred and despair? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *point ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: she locked herself up in her katstle and proteted herself with powerful magic ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so powerful that standard god tier abilities couldn't even be used to bypass the barriers ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I, think at some point she gave up. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: after all she went through, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but, so many of the others went through similar things and didn't turn out like that ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: We all deal with things differently</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I myself had to deal with demands to heal people, even though I repeatedly denied them while dealing with some of my own issues</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: probably the most useful thing i did for them was convincing them to go back in time via meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: we probably would have died otherwise</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or went insane ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: well, I already went through that</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: but that was before the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: (( small update. there is a large stone bench on near the center of the "town square" where Kat's casket is currently residing. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((mk o--o))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I think I'm gonna go to bed. If you need me I'll be up on the quinn prime, where the ground is actually stable. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: An amusing statement</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: But if all goes well, none of you will be seeingme any time soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why not? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: because my appearance last time was due circumstances.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, you actually appeared? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Yes. For about two days.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I returned early this morning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I must be an idiot not to notice someone I don't even know how they look besides lime green text. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Well, apparently there were a few other new faces milling about</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I was the one with white hair that no one really questioned</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((the bar was a bit too packed for SJ to really pay attention to much last night))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((as well as the tiredness))</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((*shrug*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eh, hair color is just a hair color. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: white wings? black suit?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's been sightings of folks with wings around here, not much special about a suit. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Unacceptable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Where is this ship?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: orbiting a different planet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Hand over the coordinates. Even if it's over Private pestering</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, why? do you want to beat the crud out of me? because I can beat myself up if you want. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, I get it: you didn't want to be ignored, especially with a really fancy suit on. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Niki.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: No. It simply upsets me that I went through the trouble of going against what I said i would</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and I'm being a jerk about it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Should I bring Kat's coffin somewhere...</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: No, it is just that you do not remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was like, half-asleep last night ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and, I'm not sure where her coffin should go... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I don't want to leave it outside...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just wondering: is the katstle still super freaky looking, or is it cleaned up mostly? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I am not sure...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: last time a bunch of us went there, it was really gross. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CAS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, barf in your lunch gross ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but apparently FL took a bunch of alien crud and stored it away in his now locked sylladex. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: i doubt you will find your answer tonight SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, too tired for that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: ...I'll move the coffin into the bar's basement.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I was about to recommend that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: mind the spoopy guy ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some weird ghst dude who put up a bunch of tacky halloween decorations and plays the organ. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *ghost ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Oh, him</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I suppose you don't usually see ghosts</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: usually. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's freaky when some of them are visible, that's for sure. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I suppose for normal people it would be</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((oh crud, it's 2 am))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((*wistles*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: It is done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I'll be returning to Earth now, I'll be back tomorrow when everyone pays their respects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright. I'll probably wind up sleeping in again, like i always seem to do on weekends. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Try to sleep well tonight Niki... I know I'll be trying to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Good night...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thanks. Goodnight. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CIB</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((meeting up with EP tomorrow, I'll be offline until the evening))</span><br />
