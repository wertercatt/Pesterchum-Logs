<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no. also why are you magenta-ing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#ff00ff">Blame Heart powers.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#ff00ff">I'm on the ship right now, but everyone seems asleep and I'm not gonna start knocking on doors.</span></span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#ff00ff">Well, Niki apparently feels like trash so I feel that I have to fix that.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dang... well okay, lemme know if I can help with that... I've been just as concerned about her, and just as unable to do anything about it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well maybe you can take care of the lesser issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And looks like I finally managed to get out of Heart mode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what's the lesser issue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also I'm still in club so delayed responses are likely))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, just the cooling failure in my mountain base. For the geothermal generators.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The automatic shutoff valves managed to successfully activate, but until the cooling gets back online, the lights are gonna be off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, that and the elevator.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I'm competent enough to have a system to prevent a worse issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((...actually yeah, I am gonna have to wait until I get home to do the thing.))</span><br />
