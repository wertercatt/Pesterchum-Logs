<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 INCIPISPHERE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT ChanServ [CCC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT circuitousAntipathy [CCA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Well in other news I found some of my cosplay props! Sadly it looks like imps made off with the rest of itΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bluh. finally back from that miniquest thingy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞welcome back?Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I wish future me had warned me about the stairs...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞The stairs are always out to get you man V:Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or more specifically, that despite being four-legged giving +12 against Stairs, it's still possible to roll a nat 1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞it at least means you'll get a 20 later down the lineΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, you subscribe to Darths &amp; Droids dice theory huh? :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey, last week the stairs got me a good one. then again, prostheticlegkind isn't exactly the best thing for balance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#969619">CURRENT elaborateUtopianist [CEU]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: What dice theory?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It is perfectly reasonable to assume that</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: in time, should you roll enough dies</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Nah, I just used to play DnDΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: at least one of those results will come up</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Its just part of dice karmaΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And though I do not pay full supplication to the Random Dice Gods</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞It really applies to all things. Once you suffer a loss you will suffer a win.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Superstition and luck seem to be actual, quantifiable measures in this metareality game</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: There is benefit towards supplicating them on occasion</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmm, that is true. as a Light Player, I actually *should* be putting more faith in the Heart of the Cards... or dice, as it were.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞I wonder if Karma applies here as well.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Perhaps</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Though I like to think of it better as...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Justice</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Have you found evidence, CP, for your Class as of yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Interesting that I'm a Mind player then :VΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not yet. Issun's taken to calling me the Wolf of Light, but as far as my ACTUAL class... idk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably not Bard or Prince, I don't destroy things through luck. also doubtful about Thief/Rogue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Hehe. Karma is a powerful force in paradox space. Great sacrifices shackle less than power.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I find as a Heart player, I am uniquely qualified to know exactly where I stand in the grand scheme of things</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞at least you aren't destroying yourself.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞so good job!Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, while I was recovering from a stair-boggled thinkpan, anything interesting happen? I saw SV posted some land scans on Bubblr...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞TT's quirk was being wierd as usual V:Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, mostly her connection</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Some more people have posted error logs, it appears</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Nothing new of note through the Chumosphere, aside from the usual drivel</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Her connection ascended to the level of Eldritch Horror and played dark games with our souls :VΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Such a harsh crowdΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes. kinda glad I missed that, I don't want to go grimbark. especially now that the term is canon!</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞you're stiffling my comedic geniousΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞genius*Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, Kat is one of my closest friends around here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞She'll be fine. You worry too muchΣ</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Unless Hussie is alive and well and posting updates that none of us can access, I say that an alternative universe's rendition of Homestuck does not count as canon</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Oh it looks like SV got a good pic of my land.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's your land in that post?</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Frogs and Tunnels?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: ..</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: My mistake</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞V:Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞wish I had planetkind. Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'll have to ask for a scan of Land of Snow and Crystal later...</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞CA: WIELD THE SWORD OF LEGENDΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Mostly because I have no idea what to do with that damn swordΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#b30a0a">CDP: like how it would kill me if it could</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ._.;</span><br />

<span style="color:#b30a0a">CDP: pre...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh gog...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Don't worry, it can't kill you directly</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Indirectly, yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#b30a0a">CDP: well i cant die so it will just be very painful</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  tries to facepaw, but he's too sore from MOTHERBARKING STAIRS, so he headdesks instead --</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But there's safeguards in place to ensure your Sprite doesn't up and murder your ass for prototyping it, at least there should be...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞watch out for stairs broΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞I'm surpised no one prototyped stairsΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Would have been too OP even for SBURB</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how do you even prototype a stair?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞powertoolsΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: one thing I should try next time: as soon as I trip, I should flip onto my back and ride the reflector like a makeshift sled, like that one episode of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: stairssprite: the only thing worse than prototyping a First Guardian.</span><br />

<span style="color:#b30a0a">CDP: hes fucking wolverine for fucks sake</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Tell him if he can't man up you'll force him to talk to some of the other sprites</span><br />
