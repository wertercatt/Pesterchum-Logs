[07:11:27] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#802020">CFL</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGLOSTPAWNS HIDEOUT.</span><br />
[07:11:34] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  slowly gets up --</span><br />
[07:11:58] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...huh. dreams.</span><br />
[07:12:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Nevermind that, do we have a barcode scanner around here anywhere?</span><br />
[07:21:16] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  examines the color version that kageto made. --</span><br />
[07:21:20] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...no, that isn't it.</span><br />
[07:22:17] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#5baa9d">CURRENT bombasticHydrogen [CBH]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[07:22:17] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ...who are you talking to?</span><br />
[07:22:51] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: obviously I'm...</span><br />
[07:23:01] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  notices the room is basically completely empty --</span><br />
[07:23:02] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  has been doing push ups in the corner for two hours --</span><br />
[07:23:02] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:23:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: fffff</span><br />
[07:23:39] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ...</span><br />
[07:23:51] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: good morning?</span><br />
[07:25:18] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ((pesterchum is an alarm now))</span><br />
[07:33:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: FL, you ever figure anything else out about the notes?</span><br />
[07:38:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Either we need to find someone named brown, or we are looking for nothing.</span><br />
[07:38:34] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: or perhaps something hidden in nothing</span><br />
[07:38:40] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I'm pretty sure that star has some kind of significance</span><br />
[07:38:48] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: THAT'S IT!</span><br />
[07:38:52] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: A void player!</span><br />
[07:38:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Its a gog damn meme.</span><br />
[07:39:12] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: oh</span><br />
[07:39:13] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: shit</span><br />
[07:39:58] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Unless we are suppose to fly like a piece of shit and crash into the <span style="color:#00ff00">Green Sun</span>.</span><br />
[07:40:43] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: well what about the star then?</span><br />
[07:40:53] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it seems odd to me</span><br />
[07:41:16] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a piece of paper, and draws a shitty star with the words "you tried" inside of it. --</span><br />
[07:41:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I... don't get it</span><br />
[07:41:49] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:42:08] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: aaand we have a breath player who has spent his life living under a rock.</span><br />
[07:42:21] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...to be fair, thats all of us right now.</span><br />
[07:42:32] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: well, except for the breath part, thats just you.</span><br />
[07:42:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Look</span><br />
[07:42:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I lived in a fucking jungle</span><br />
[07:43:25] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: With spotty as the 101 dalmatians cell service</span><br />
[07:43:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and an even worse internet connection</span><br />
[07:43:43] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Why couldn't you have just let her chase me and rage off on the other side of the land when you interogated seth?</span><br />
[07:43:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Its a miracle I could even RUN Sburb</span><br />
[07:44:08] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Because you might have died</span><br />
[07:44:42] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: You ended up damaging me more than she could have.</span><br />
[07:45:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that was mostly after the Seth thing, though</span><br />
[07:45:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: btw, what were you even trying to accomplish with that?</span><br />
[07:46:01] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Get her away from the meteor so you weren't getting distracted.</span><br />
[07:46:26] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Wow, seriously?</span><br />
[07:46:32] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Well then sorry</span><br />
[07:46:41] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I thought you were just being a prick</span><br />
[07:47:13] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: If there is anything I'm really good it, its getting people pissed off at me.</span><br />
[07:47:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( good at* ))</span><br />
[07:47:47] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: He might as well be gone</span><br />
[07:47:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that interrogation wasn't really going anywhere</span><br />
[07:47:57] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: like</span><br />
[07:47:58] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: AT ALL</span><br />
[07:48:44] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: If you had more time... you might have been able to redeem him.</span><br />
[07:48:52] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...maybe.</span><br />
[07:49:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i'm not so sure</span><br />
[07:49:11] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I thought I could get somewhere</span><br />
[07:49:17] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and I thought I was getting somewhere</span><br />
[07:49:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but look how that turned out</span><br />
[07:49:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: still gone</span><br />
[07:49:42] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and still leaving those douchy notes</span><br />
[07:50:10] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And still knowing where he actually stands on the alignment scale.</span><br />
[07:50:27] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
[07:51:16] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: He sees himself as evil, and regrets it in a way... but considering he is still doing it, he might feel he has no choise in the matter, or that not doing what he is doing would make things even worse.</span><br />
[07:52:05] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I think the only way to redeem him would be to be a mind player</span><br />
[07:52:40] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: All it takes is a single choise.</span><br />
[07:53:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: HIS choice</span><br />
[07:53:19] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
[07:53:24] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and since he refuses to make the right one</span><br />
[07:53:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we're kind of at a loss</span><br />
[07:53:33] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And we will not be forcing it upon him.</span><br />
[07:53:50] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: He has free will, lets keep it that way.</span><br />
[07:53:59] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: obviously</span><br />
[07:54:12] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: he's blowing off his conscience to kill people</span><br />
[07:54:41] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And that was in the session he was from... and he never targeted anyone but a dreamself.</span><br />
[07:54:58] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: He still hasn't truely killed anyone.</span><br />
[07:55:23] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it's still a death</span><br />
[07:55:27] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if anything</span><br />
[07:55:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: its a worse kind of death</span><br />
[07:56:00] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: because they can no longer come back if their real death happens</span><br />
[07:56:09] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I ended up destroying my post scratch versions quest bed on their land.</span><br />
[07:56:46] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: they still have a crypt, though</span><br />
[07:56:54] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: /exactly/</span><br />
[07:57:11] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I don't follow</span><br />
[07:57:16] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Do you think /any/ of them ever used the standard quest bed?</span><br />
[07:57:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: probably</span><br />
[08:04:38] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: As much as I want to believe that killing him isn't our best option</span><br />
[08:04:42] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it probably is</span><br />
[08:09:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: too much time and efforts been wasted on him</span><br />
[08:11:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so so far</span><br />
[08:11:06] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the messages are</span><br />
[08:11:08] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: numbers</span><br />
[08:11:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span><br />
[08:11:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and read the files  differently?</span><br />
[08:12:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that just seems like instructions</span><br />
[08:12:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: maybe he left an extra note somewhere?</span><br />
[08:15:13] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: We loaded them onto a computer and viewed it in notepad, the first one is 1234567890, the second is "The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog", notably missing the brown part, and the third... "you will find your answers nowhere"</span><br />
[08:15:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: nowhere</span><br />
[08:16:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[08:16:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: maybe we have to look in the furthest ring?</span><br />
[08:16:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i've literally been calling it Nowhere Space</span><br />
[08:16:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or maybe a dream bubble?</span><br />
[08:21:25] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: The key to life and death is everywhere to be found</span><br />
[08:21:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but if you do not find it in your own house</span><br />
[08:21:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: you will find it nowhere</span><br />
[08:21:40] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Yet</span><br />
[08:21:45] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it is before everyone's eyes</span><br />
[08:21:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: no one can live without it</span><br />
[08:21:52] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: everyone has used it</span><br />
[08:22:03] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the poor usually possess more of it than the rich</span><br />
[08:22:13] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: children play with it in the streets</span><br />
[08:22:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the meek and uneducated esteem it highly</span><br />
[08:22:32] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but the privileged and learned often throw it away</span><br />
[08:22:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: when rejected</span><br />
[08:22:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it lies dormant in the bowels of the earth</span><br />
[08:22:50] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: It is the only thing</span><br />
[08:22:51] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: from which </span><br />
[08:23:01] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the Philosopher's Stone can be prepared</span><br />
[08:23:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and without it</span><br />
[08:23:09] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: no noble metal can ever be created</span><br />
[08:23:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  slowly steps the fuck away --</span><br />
[08:23:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that's what comes to mind from that last message</span><br />
[08:24:08] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  runs downstairs and shoves some rubble in the way --</span><br />
[08:24:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: uuh</span><br />
[08:24:37] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the fuck?</span><br />
[08:25:04] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  follows --</span><br />
[08:25:13] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: dude, what the fuck are you even doing</span><br />
[08:25:56] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  // The rubble is in the way. You cannot proceed. --</span><br />

[08:26:15] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  wind blasts the rubble --</span><br />
[08:26:30] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  is nowhere to be found on the floor of the room. --</span><br />
[08:26:39] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: FL!</span><br />
[08:26:43] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Get out here!</span><br />
[08:26:47] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what the fuck is wrong?</span><br />
[08:28:20] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  uncaptchalogues a jar of sand --</span><br />
[08:28:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I will sand storm this entire room if you don't come out</span><br />
[08:28:50] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: ...</span><br />
[08:28:54] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: hello?</span><br />

[08:30:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: fuck it</span><br />
[08:30:52] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  smashes the jar of sand on the ground --</span><br />
[08:31:10] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  // You feel a small pebble drop on you. --</span><br />

[08:34:13] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: what the fuck are you even doing?</span><br />
[08:34:27] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I think I remember what I remember that from</span><br />
[08:34:31] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it was some online thing</span><br />
[08:34:40] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the title of the page was something like</span><br />
[08:34:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: "do you know the answer to the Ultimate Riddle"</span><br />
[08:35:11] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: 42</span><br />
[08:35:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i'm sorry...</span><br />
[08:35:35] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: 42?</span><br />
[08:35:53] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Yes, its the answer.</span><br />
[08:37:20] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: to the ultimate riddle?</span><br />
[08:37:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I don't think so.</span><br />
[08:37:57] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Then what is the question?</span><br />
[08:38:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: do I have to recite it again?</span><br />
[08:38:27] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I mean, what is the riddle itself?</span><br />
[08:38:41] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I'm afraid I don't understand</span><br />
[08:38:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: didn't I just tell you what it was?</span><br />
[08:39:53] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Hey, whats that behind you?</span><br />
[08:39:59] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT forgottenLord <span style="color:#802020">[CFL]</span>  points --</span><br />
