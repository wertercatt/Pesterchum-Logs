<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  takes a look around as he steps through --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there should be a few guest rooms down the hall on this floor, I'll write a note for Ash...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: she might be u<span style="color:#730e8f">p in the frog lab</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: if not... she'll definitely s<span style="color:#730e8f">ee a note on that door</span></span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: she might even be asleep right now actually, she's not logged into pesterchum...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  points FS down a hall, there are three guest rooms on each side, presumably all empty at the moment --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: if I recall correctly, the<span style="color:#730e8f">y were good friends</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks around for a blank piece of paper... only to remember SJ offloaded some of her Random Blank Pages onto him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  sets DS down on a bed in one of the guest rooms --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  pulls one out, and starts writing a note with his tail. why can't he just use a pen like a normal person? :P --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fortuitousSleuth <span style="color:#ceca54">[CFS]</span>  walks back into the livingroom --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  takes the note and puts it on the door to DS' room. the note reads, "DS got Heartsucked in a dungeon. keep an eye on him just in case, he's basically in a coma until we can get it back from his denizen or something. -CP" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess that'll have to do for now...</span><br />
