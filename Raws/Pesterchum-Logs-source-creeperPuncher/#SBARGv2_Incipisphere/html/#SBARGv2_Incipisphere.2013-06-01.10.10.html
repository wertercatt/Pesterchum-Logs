<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The HH Arkaiser.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: What is that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Like a carapacian ship?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's cute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not just /a/ ship, but /the/ ship. This baby's of my own creation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: that kind of ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Created a barebones ship with alchemy, tore it down to the chassis, and built it up from scratch. Some of... Ha, who am I kidding, most of the systems in this thing might put a carapacian ship to shame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So it was the kind of ship I originally thought you meant by 'ship'</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Is what bigger on the inside?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ih</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It doesn't need to be, its plenty big as is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could we repurpose it as a back up base incase the lands explode?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Took a cue from the Super Galatic Dai-Gurren, or Cathedral Terra  if you prefer, and rigged it with an intricate web of transportilizers to facilitate movement</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: FL, I think there is probabely an artifact pertaining to LoLaB on your planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can it turn into a giant mecha?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: That thing with the satalites, those satalits were just abstractions</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you charted the path the satalite is taking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So I think that an artifact for another planet has been created on every planet in our chain</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Probably not. But I mean, the weapons and defense systems are more then good enough to tear stuff to pieces</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is it watching a fixed location?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: its not an actual satalite</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It just symbolizes the placing of the artifact</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And besides I've got a couple other mechs. Chances are we're not gonna run into anything bigger'n em</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: So you have my artifact</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, I'm gonna check out this abstraction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe it might have a hint or something on it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: si what is the point of this ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: to look barking awesome obviously. but I think also as a secondary base when the Bacafe inevitably falls?</span><br />
