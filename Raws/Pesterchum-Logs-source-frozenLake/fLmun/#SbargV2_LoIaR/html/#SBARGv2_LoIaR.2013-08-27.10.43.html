[10:55:01] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You got me here, after all. I was /perfectly/ content to be where I was, but nooo.</span><br />
[11:02:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...You question if I am suicidal, yet I'm one of the /few/ people who hasn't run off to kill themselves on a quest bed.</span><br />
