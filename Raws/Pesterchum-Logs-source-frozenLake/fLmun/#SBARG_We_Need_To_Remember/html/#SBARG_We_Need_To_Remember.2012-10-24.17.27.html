<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I think it's mostly about my mental state.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: And the last part...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I hope it just doesn't happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I actually can't technically argue that, OR, but it's not an effective way to earn trust</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: did you write it before, in the last session, or since then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Just now actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I don't need his trust. Only his compliance. He needs to remember. Before the Scratch, he would have understood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: well, if the rumors that we need to re enter the Medium are true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: but not trusting you is going to make him resistant to the memories</span><br />

<span style="color:#1c488d">CAS: Might I intervine to ask what exactly we are doing here? A simple question but neve rhurts to be sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1 = 3 always...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: He already doesn't trust me, because I will not share the memories with him. He wants to remember, that much is certain; I simply want him to do it without me giving him a memory directly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or is it the other way around?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">PCA: 「I have returned. Pardon my sudden absence but the matter that caused it has been...taken care of.」</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: Simply pushing him in the right direction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: god, I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: He will not answer unless directly spoken to. The rest of this chat is being obscured from him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: what we're doing, AS is trying to help each other remember</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: for the most part</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: some are here for other reasons</span><br />
<span style="color:#1c488d">CAS: I see. What other reasons?</span><br />

<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: of course, AS, I made this memo to help people</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">PCA: 「Thank you DC. I am here for similar reasons as the majority.」</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I do not wish for him to be triggered by anything that is said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: He is currently in a state between dreaming, and remembering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: You're very welcome ouo</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: The very state that helped bring about my existence.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I am protecting him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: DH, how much have you managed to remember, and are you okay?</span><br />
