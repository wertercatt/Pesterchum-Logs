[03:51:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh...?</span><br />
[03:52:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, catch this with a spherical shield when I toss it in the air.</span><br />
[03:52:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  tosses the cube in the air. --</span><br />

[03:52:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright... now, can you /shrink/ the shield down?</span><br />
[03:53:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like those shield traps in Bob and George?</span><br />
[03:53:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, to "shrink-wrap" the object, or actually shrink the contents?</span><br />
[03:53:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Shrink Wrap, sorta.</span><br />
[03:54:06] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  taps a couple buttons and the shield does so, assuming a cube-with-rounded-edges shape --</span><br />
[03:54:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[03:54:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, can you crush the cube with the shield?</span><br />
[03:54:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh... I see what you're thinking. --or not.</span><br />
[03:55:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also probably not.</span><br />
[03:55:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Alright, fair enough.</span><br />
[03:55:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least you being able to create a full body bind helps matters.</span><br />
[03:56:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: expecially since it works on voiders, as seen with Billards.</span><br />
[03:57:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You can drop the cube now.</span><br />
[03:57:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  holds out his hand to catch it. --</span><br />
[03:57:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, Containment Field's /default/ is actually form-fitting for living subjects.</span><br />

[04:00:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heh, I sort of wonder if it could have contained 682 if you had it back at that dungeon.</span><br />
[04:02:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure. like you said, all forcefields work by pushing back with equal force, and I dunno what kind of force 682 would've had... or worse, absorbing it.</span><br />
[04:02:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[04:03:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: holy fuck how much energy do you have going to it.</span><br />
[04:04:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, Copland has an infinite battery since I integrated a Golden Power Hub into it shortly before we left the session... but the power output rate isn't infinite.</span><br />
[04:05:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And eventually, my spin would start releasing more visible light radiation than I could build up...</span><br />
[04:05:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thus giving /me/ a limit too...</span><br />
[04:05:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, the shield can contain most kinds of conventional explosions and radiation to a point, but a nuke would probably overwhelm it.</span><br />
[04:06:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets hope we never have to find out that limit.</span><br />
[04:06:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[04:06:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at least we know the limit is /higher/ than a Chaos Dunk.</span><br />
[04:06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, my chaos dunk was not nearly as powerful as a true one.</span><br />
[04:07:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, all I had going for it was the kinetic energy of the meteor.</span><br />
[04:07:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: none of those anti b-ball protons.</span><br />
[04:09:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, what DT did was closer to a Chaos Dunk.</span><br />
[04:09:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...stronger than a ballistic meteor impact, then.</span><br />
[04:09:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[04:11:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a release of temperatures nearly reaching 15 Thousand Kelvin.</span><br />
[04:11:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the surface area of the shield is also a factor... but enough talk about that for now.</span><br />
