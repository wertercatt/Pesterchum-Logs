<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> I guesss that could count, as long as you still count the revenge thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also, im gonna say "things that happen to rose that upset kanaya" are fairly minor compared to whats happened to everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so that leaves</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: getting over vriska, and being injured and then healed almost immediately</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span>'d still count those</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so still not much compared to everyone else</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> the point is that really being a mary sue isn't about being too good</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">it</span>'s about taking up the focus</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">because</span> you're so overly good</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">kanaya</span> is still pretty background of a char even though she's more prominent</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">nowadays</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: also tbh "i care too much about my friends weh weh" is a very sue-ish problem to have</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">while</span> she still is a bit overly good it's not in your face</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> sues tend to use because they don't want to be sues</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah but when thats basically the only problem you have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not sure wether the stuff about having the resoponsability of trying to continue the troll race is a sue-ish thing in this context or not. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">I</span> would think</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah having the responsibility to carry the troll race is a bit sue-ish too</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span> that's not too sue-ish given that it realistically shows "oh crap this is stressful what if everything goes wrong"</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">a</span> bit sue-ish</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">but</span> not too much</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (though it does kind of throw it in the background)</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (the stress)</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: comes a bit too close to "i just want to be normal"</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: which is so sueish jesus</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">that</span>'s</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">also</span> sueish just from sue-abuse of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">sues</span> often just use it as "I just want to be normal" for no good reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">if</span> it actually has a good reason (like showing the stress) it still leaves a bad taste from the suebuse but not as bad</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">But</span> yeah I think that it doesn't particularly matter if she's a sue</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and again, tbh all of this also needs to be put into the perspective of</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: <span style="color:#4d3c37">because</span> she's in the background compared to everyone</span><br />
