[08:11:14] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi CS ➜</span><br />
[08:11:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I prototyped... cruxite.</span><br />
[08:11:34] <span style="color:#ffaa00">?AE: I still don't know what to prototype next</span><br />
[08:11:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, I didn't have much time.</span><br />
[08:11:49] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: usually best thing to do is save it ➜</span><br />
[08:11:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I wonder what would happen if you prototyped a sprite</span><br />
[08:11:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold the prototype</span><br />
[08:11:59] <span style="color:#ffaa00">?AE: kk</span><br />
[08:12:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: RS, no.</span><br />
[08:12:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A prototyped sprite that is.</span><br />
[08:12:11] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#c1bb10">CURRENT courageousScribe [CCS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />

[08:12:14] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey CS.</span><br />
[08:12:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That leads to black holes.</span><br />
[08:12:20] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nooooo.</span><br />
[08:12:34] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Only when they're both unprototyped sprites, probably.</span><br />
[08:12:57] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm thinking if the other one was already used up, it would probably just allow for more prototype stacking ➜</span><br />
[08:13:05] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's /exactly/ what I'm thinking</span><br />
[08:13:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[08:13:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Else you prototype the ability to prototype...</span><br />
[08:13:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and that doesn't end well.</span><br />
[08:13:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might get a little unstable though, depending on the contents ➜</span><br />
[08:13:31] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Prototyping gives the sprite the attributes of whatever its PTed with, and the only attribute of an empty kernal is sucking things in</span><br />
[08:13:54] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But through that hack I wonder if you might be able to prototype something four times...</span><br />
[08:13:56] <span style="color:#ffaa00">?AE: so I also got this code in the manual of my copy SBURB but I don't know what it's for</span><br />
[08:14:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ah yes, the txt file</span><br />
[08:14:25] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((...AE do you know the general story behind v2, have you seen the tumblr or any of the help docs?))</span><br />
[08:14:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Keep it.</span><br />
[08:15:25] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: if it's a short scrambled nonsense code, that's to figure out your aspect. ➜</span><br />
[08:15:40] <span style="color:#ffaa00">?AE: oh ok</span><br />
[08:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It also makes something in the alchemiter that I STILL DON'T HAVE THE FRACKING GRIST FOR.</span><br />
[08:17:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I bet its gonna be awesome.</span><br />
[08:17:39] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even after all that gristtorrenting off of FI? ➜</span><br />

[08:19:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, it kinda plopped you into ours.</span><br />
[08:19:22] <span style="color:#6fbaa1">CAG: … this /is/ the Session.</span><br />
[08:19:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its weird.</span><br />

[08:19:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But you have no gates...</span><br />

[08:21:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AG, structual support is still a thing.</span><br />
[08:22:00] <span style="color:#6fbaa1">CAG: No, I meant how do you drop stuff into the void.</span><br />
[08:22:06] <span style="color:#6fbaa1">CAG: Like. It's still /right there/.</span><br />
[08:22:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if stairs weigh a ton... wall comes loose.</span><br />
[08:22:11] <span style="color:#6fbaa1">CAG: You just /pick it up again/.</span><br />
[08:22:27] <span style="color:#6fbaa1">CAG: Or better yet how do you drop grist in the first place.</span><br />
[08:22:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not all of us have houses planted firmly on the ground.</span><br />
[08:22:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He dropped the stairs.</span><br />
[08:22:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: duh</span><br />

[08:23:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, just wondering.</span><br />
[08:23:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This game has something against plumming.</span><br />
