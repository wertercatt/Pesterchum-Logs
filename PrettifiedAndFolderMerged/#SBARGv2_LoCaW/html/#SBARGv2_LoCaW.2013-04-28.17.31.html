<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *The arrow, upon hitting the mountain, creates a white sphere which expands to a 10ft radius, then within six seconds, dissapates.*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT midnightOger <span style="color:#9c2bff">[CMO]</span>  aims a "small" explotion arrow at an other mountain, and fires the bright white arrow --</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So its about... *does the math* 8 times better than mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: for some reason the game calls that small to be sarcastic</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, but it IS small.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Compared to other stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: ya but it seer force makes it useless</span><br />
<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: fire that at an imp and you nuke everything in including your self and your team</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But what about firing it at the black king?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9c2bff">CMO: to bow is magical after all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well, there goes one polymorph bomb.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think you could manage to like cast a hand coming out of the arrow to set it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT midnightOger <span style="color:#9c2bff">[CMO]</span>  holds up his glove, the glove starts to glow --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Set it to... 20 seconds.</span><br />
