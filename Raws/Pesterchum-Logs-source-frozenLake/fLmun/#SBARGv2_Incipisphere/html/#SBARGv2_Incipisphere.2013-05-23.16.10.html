<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: let's see if I got this right</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: if we're traveling through paradox space</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: we'll not just have to deal with meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: but the space ogres</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the glitch clouds.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: AND these wierd glitch cloud things?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *the medium, paradox space refers more to the timespac continuum</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: and The Corrupted... wherever it ended up</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: They seem to pull themselves together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: even still, allow me to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: MOTHERFUCK</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: "Furthest Ring", FS</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  is already inserting the "Lyoko Tower" card into the totem lathe --</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Okay, I just missed with the rocket punch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Guess it's a good thing I finished Unit-0, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: actually isn't furthest ring more the outer rim/the void?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  don't return to the past! --</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oi oi, don't get yourself killed now... I"m on my way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...unless it was in the tower.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  with all these glitches i beg to differ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  better yet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we have the glitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  glitches? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#39b873">[CCP]</span>  figures it'll be more of a Doomed Timeline Rewinder without having a specific Time player doing it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  or polymorphic clones? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: which mighτ as well BE τhe danger.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You don't know what all the weapons in the mech /you/ made do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: On the plus side, one space orge is dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Seriously dude?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See if there is a button to kill spy imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Well... kind of. I know what they SHOULD do but... well, this one was made with Mega XLR.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: be careful what you P.O.K.E. out of the session... we still don't know if ectobiolobabbies are going to be a thing, and you might end up Furthest Ringing the meteor they're supposed to appear on</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: first... the medium... then... HE WORLD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So you made it with alchemy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ah man...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Sadly, 'save the world' seems to be broken</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I combined it with Big O for maxium punhyness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Put some tape over "the world" and replace it with "Skaia".</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ((RS: I actually didn't plan to Return to the Past. it's kinda godmoddingy. but IC I was preparing to, to be safe.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it works, sburb is stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (i was actually just being silly in semi-ooc don't mind it)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If not, at least reality still makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...lets try it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: *BITZT* ajasgfuglaivgfia;sifugyifgae.l;oijgophouabhsufi;gluvqwnfqpoje.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FF?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: FL, you'd make a good Foundation researcher. your "who gives a fuck" attitude about potential catastrophies is awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What the hell happened to ya FF?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: oh gog</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: (its cool)</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: the timeball is self-aware, because if it says "ok" and we ignore FF, he'll stop being ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: so a vague answer is the most temporally safe, I think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Not gonna lie gonna be a little miffed if I can't even do anything with the Alt after all that work on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#39b873">CCP: actually, I've tasted blue before. there's a certain flavor of mountain dew that actually tastes like the color blue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've managed to taste lightning before.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...It tastes like batterys.</span><br />
