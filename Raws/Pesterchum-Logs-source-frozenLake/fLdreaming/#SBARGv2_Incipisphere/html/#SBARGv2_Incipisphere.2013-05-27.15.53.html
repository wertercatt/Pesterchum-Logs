<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Always.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: jokerKind, from one interpretation i saw, is anything with comidic value can be used with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: ...Like bows?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Guess that could work too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think its fair to remember you don't need a specibus card to use that kind of weapon it just makes really good storage for them</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I find it similar to that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: actually, between HS and Replay Value, I was under the assumption that Sburb Logic actually prevents you from strifing with something you don't have an abstractus for, with the exception of Sylladex Weaponization</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Shaving cream.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: That is all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: but since we're more self-aware than normal players because of all the broken code, Sburb Logic doesn't nerf our ability to just beat imps over the head with things</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Nor does it stop john from spraying imps with shaving cream... he just isn't GOOD at it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did any of you guys ever read Be the Sedwelling Lowblood while it was still going on?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: because he was the only one who ever realized it was flamiable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the way I see it, no particular kind is really "the best", you just need to be creative and have fun with it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Do you think, for example, that I know how to use a shotgun? Well, other than point and shoot...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Okay bad example.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Excuse me, drillKind can pierce the heavens</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Do you think I know how to use a scalpel?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's basically the best kind</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I do</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I don't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: As it is not a sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If you're not using it as a weapon</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I might know that it is sharp and you cut things with it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: scalpelKind wouldn't suddenly turn you into Derek Stiles</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You could probably still use it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: but In no means am I proficient with a scalpel.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: By that logic you literally couldn't use anything if it wasn't a weapon</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: keytoolKind is basically just shouting "Copland: [Random Thing]!", but I doubt I'd be able to use the Celestial Brush as well as I do without the brushKind specibus. more of just flailing it around</span><br />

<span style="color:#c31212">CND: They have a bunch of modded ones</span><br />
