[17:56:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, same-old-same-old.</span><br />
[17:57:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: lately I've been hopping back and forth between Starter and Augataur...</span><br />
[17:58:00] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Kimura, do you /know/ how much power it takes to keep that door powered?</span><br />
[17:58:41] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Augatuar?</span><br />
[17:58:42] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I might have to figure out how to power machines using laughter!</span><br />
[17:59:23] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And I just /know/ that would violate thermodynamics!</span><br />
[18:03:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL: it's only powered when it's in use, and I have a remote terminal on the other side so it can be turned on from either.</span><br />
[18:03:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF: Augataur is IB's planet that he made.</span><br />
[18:04:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's kind of early-Earth-ish.</span><br />
[18:04:04] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...how the fuck did he make a planet.</span><br />
[18:04:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Weird Time Shit. basically, guiding the formation of a galaxy to make it happen in a way similar to the original Milky Way.</span><br />
[18:04:56] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Huh.</span><br />
[18:05:28] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: You think that would be more spacey.</span><br />
[18:06:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... but apparently he found a way to do it Timeways.</span><br />
[18:07:16] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...that makes no sense.</span><br />

[18:14:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the way I understand it, is that he used Time Shenans to basically make it so of all the possible ways the galaxy could have formed, the "chosen" timeline would be the one where it formed into a near-copy of the Milky Way.</span><br />
[18:14:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: --welp</span><br />
