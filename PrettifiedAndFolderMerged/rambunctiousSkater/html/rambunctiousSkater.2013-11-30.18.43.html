[06:46:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Please don't tell the memo.</span><br />

[07:07:19] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Alright Pokémon mechanics...</span><br />
[07:07:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: The battle's over and you could say you "switched out" so chances are you're fine.</span><br />
[07:08:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah, except for the visible cracks.</span><br />
[07:09:35] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: You have cracks.</span><br />
[07:10:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, remember when I made a sword using my own code as a component, causing the sword to be a manifestation of my own soul?</span><br />
[07:12:33] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: And there are cracks in this sword</span><br />

[07:13:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Well, lets give it a shot.</span><br />
[07:14:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Got a place in mind?</span><br />

[07:18:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Memo? ))</span><br />
[07:18:45] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: ((didn't really think we needed one for it since it's just the two of us, PMs work))</span><br />
[07:18:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  finally lands on the land. --</span><br />
[07:19:56] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  lounges on the roof of a consort hut, one of many in the small village. --</span><br />

[07:21:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  raises an eyebrow as he looks FL up and down, something off about his looks? --</span><br />
[07:22:30] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  // It doesn't seem to be a thing with his looks... other than the pale skin. --</span><br />
[07:25:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Huh.</span><br />
[07:25:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Have you always been that pasty?</span><br />
[07:26:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[07:26:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: one moment.</span><br />
[07:26:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  pulls out a mirror. --</span><br />
[07:26:08] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  smirks. --</span><br />
[07:26:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...yeah, thats... a bit more than usual.</span><br />
[07:27:09] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Alright well you're not dead yet so, I guess you've either got a bit more than three turns or turns are long as fuck.</span><br />
[07:28:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Hold on, one uses an attack or item every turn in pokemon, right?</span><br />
[07:28:48] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Yeah</span><br />
[07:29:17] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: ...So what's that mean, you haven't gotten in a fight since then?</span><br />
[07:29:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...No. No I havent.</span><br />
[07:29:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Well that's good if nothing else.</span><br />
[07:30:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Or maybe I haven't used anything from my selection of "moves"</span><br />
[07:30:32] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  sighs. --</span><br />
[07:30:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Cause maybe a drinking contest /may/ count as a fight?</span><br />
[07:31:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: No idea.</span><br />
[07:31:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[07:31:48] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  uncaptchas his sword, showing it. There are pink glowing cracks along the length of the blade. --</span><br />
[07:31:49] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Annnnd this is why you don't fuck with Pokémon and other goddamn games.</span><br />

[07:32:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What, Doctor Bright?</span><br />
[07:32:40] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Nah not that.</span><br />

[07:33:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  lifts his left arm, green flames engulfing it. --</span><br />
[07:33:42] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  steps forward, slowly. --</span><br />
[07:34:26] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  shortly after he waves it toward FL, the flames washing over him and burning away any impurities to his soul, a category that hopefully includes Perish Song. --</span><br />
[07:34:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  falls over, covered by the flames, the pink around the cracks on his sword vanishing. --</span><br />
[07:36:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  for the record they don't burn as normal flames would, merely warm to the touch and soothingly so. --</span><br />
[07:36:10] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  didn't set you on actual fire that'd be fucked up --</span><br />
[07:36:27] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  still falls over, after all, its touching his soul. --</span><br />
[07:36:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  fair enough --</span><br />
[07:37:05] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: ...You okay over there?</span><br />
[07:37:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: y-yeah.</span><br />
[07:37:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: The pink is gone...</span><br />
[07:37:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[07:37:36] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Hahahaha I guess it is kinda like a washout or a cleanse. 'f you're not used to it...</span><br />
[07:37:39] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  grabs his sword and looks at it more closely. --</span><br />
[07:37:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[RS]</span>  whistles --</span><br />
[07:37:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...ah hell.</span><br />
[07:41:58] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: ...S'matter?</span><br />
[07:42:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...It might have gotten rid of the effect Perish Song was having...</span><br />
[07:42:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: but it... didn't fix the damage.</span><br />
[07:44:46] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Damage from /what/?</span><br />
[07:45:25] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span>  holds up the sword, and while the cracks aren't glowing... they are still there. --</span><br />
[07:48:22] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: So Perish Song damages your soul now?</span><br />
[07:48:26] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: That's a thing</span><br />
[07:48:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Not sure...</span><br />
[07:48:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Maybe my soul is healed, but the sword is the only thing that is damaged?</span><br />
[07:49:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I mean, its not like removing what is causing cracks fixes those cracks.</span><br />
[07:49:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: The would be even more stupid than people thinking Big Rigs is a completed game.</span><br />
[07:51:22] <span style="color:#9d001f">RS: Makes sense.</span><br />
