[07:38:06] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Either we need to find someone named brown, or we are looking for nothing.</span><br />
[07:38:34] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: or perhaps something hidden in nothing</span><br />
[07:38:40] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I'm pretty sure that star has some kind of significance</span><br />

[07:40:53] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it seems odd to me</span><br />

[07:42:32] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: well, except for the breath part, thats just you.</span><br />
[07:42:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Look</span><br />
[07:42:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I lived in a fucking jungle</span><br />
[07:43:25] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: With spotty as the 101 dalmatians cell service</span><br />
[07:43:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and an even worse internet connection</span><br />
[07:43:43] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Why couldn't you have just let her chase me and rage off on the other side of the land when you interogated seth?</span><br />
[07:43:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Its a miracle I could even RUN Sburb</span><br />
[07:44:08] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Because you might have died</span><br />
[07:44:42] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: You ended up damaging me more than she could have.</span><br />
[07:45:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that was mostly after the Seth thing, though</span><br />
[07:45:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: btw, what were you even trying to accomplish with that?</span><br />
[07:46:01] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Get her away from the meteor so you weren't getting distracted.</span><br />
[07:46:26] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Wow, seriously?</span><br />
[07:46:32] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Well then sorry</span><br />
[07:46:41] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I thought you were just being a prick</span><br />
[07:47:13] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: If there is anything I'm really good it, its getting people pissed off at me.</span><br />
[07:47:25] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: (( good at* ))</span><br />
[07:47:47] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: He might as well be gone</span><br />
[07:47:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that interrogation wasn't really going anywhere</span><br />
[07:47:57] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: like</span><br />
[07:47:58] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: AT ALL</span><br />
[07:48:44] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: If you had more time... you might have been able to redeem him.</span><br />
[07:48:52] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...maybe.</span><br />
[07:49:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i'm not so sure</span><br />
[07:49:11] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I thought I could get somewhere</span><br />
[07:49:17] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and I thought I was getting somewhere</span><br />
[07:49:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but look how that turned out</span><br />
[07:49:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: still gone</span><br />
[07:49:42] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and still leaving those douchy notes</span><br />
[07:50:10] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And still knowing where he actually stands on the alignment scale.</span><br />
[07:50:27] <span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT bombasticHydrogen <span style="color:#5baa9d">[CBH]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
[07:51:16] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: He sees himself as evil, and regrets it in a way... but considering he is still doing it, he might feel he has no choise in the matter, or that not doing what he is doing would make things even worse.</span><br />
[07:52:05] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I think the only way to redeem him would be to be a mind player</span><br />
[07:52:40] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: All it takes is a single choise.</span><br />
[07:53:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: HIS choice</span><br />
[07:53:19] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Exactly.</span><br />
[07:53:24] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and since he refuses to make the right one</span><br />
[07:53:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: we're kind of at a loss</span><br />
[07:53:33] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And we will not be forcing it upon him.</span><br />
[07:53:50] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: He has free will, lets keep it that way.</span><br />
[07:53:59] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: obviously</span><br />
[07:54:12] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: he's blowing off his conscience to kill people</span><br />
[07:54:41] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: And that was in the session he was from... and he never targeted anyone but a dreamself.</span><br />
[07:54:58] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: He still hasn't truely killed anyone.</span><br />
[07:55:23] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it's still a death</span><br />
[07:55:27] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: if anything</span><br />
[07:55:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: its a worse kind of death</span><br />
[07:56:00] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: because they can no longer come back if their real death happens</span><br />
[07:56:09] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: I ended up destroying my post scratch versions quest bed on their land.</span><br />
[07:56:46] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: they still have a crypt, though</span><br />
[07:56:54] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: /exactly/</span><br />
[07:57:11] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: I don't follow</span><br />
[07:57:16] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: Do you think /any/ of them ever used the standard quest bed?</span><br />
[07:57:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: probably</span><br />
[08:04:38] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: As much as I want to believe that killing him isn't our best option</span><br />
[08:04:42] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it probably is</span><br />
[08:09:02] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: too much time and efforts been wasted on him</span><br />
[08:11:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: so so far</span><br />
[08:11:06] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the messages are</span><br />
[08:11:08] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: numbers</span><br />
[08:11:22] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span><br />
[08:11:33] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: and read the files  differently?</span><br />
[08:12:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: that just seems like instructions</span><br />
[08:12:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: maybe he left an extra note somewhere?</span><br />
[08:15:13] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: We loaded them onto a computer and viewed it in notepad, the first one is 1234567890, the second is "The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog", notably missing the brown part, and the third... "you will find your answers nowhere"</span><br />
[08:15:56] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: nowhere</span><br />
[08:16:03] <span style="color:#802020">CFL: yeah</span><br />
[08:16:04] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: maybe we have to look in the furthest ring?</span><br />
[08:16:14] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: i've literally been calling it Nowhere Space</span><br />
[08:16:28] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: or maybe a dream bubble?</span><br />
[08:21:25] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: The key to life and death is everywhere to be found</span><br />
[08:21:30] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but if you do not find it in your own house</span><br />
[08:21:34] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: you will find it nowhere</span><br />
[08:21:40] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: Yet</span><br />
[08:21:45] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it is before everyone's eyes</span><br />
[08:21:49] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: no one can live without it</span><br />
[08:21:52] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: everyone has used it</span><br />
[08:22:03] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the poor usually possess more of it than the rich</span><br />
[08:22:13] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: children play with it in the streets</span><br />
[08:22:21] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the meek and uneducated esteem it highly</span><br />
[08:22:32] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: but the privileged and learned often throw it away</span><br />
[08:22:36] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: when rejected</span><br />
[08:22:44] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: it lies dormant in the bowels of the earth</span><br />

[08:22:51] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: from which </span><br />
[08:23:01] <span style="color:#5baa9d">CBH: the Philosopher's Stone can be prepared</span><br />
