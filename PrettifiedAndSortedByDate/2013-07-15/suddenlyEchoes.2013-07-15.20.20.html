[08:20] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[SE]</span> began messaging fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> at 20:20 --</span><br />
[08:20] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: So in the case that someone else here is in the same postion as I am. I am going to have to ask you to clarify a small bit. You have told Ash this under the pretense of keeping the Horrorterrors out. Yes?</span><br />
[08:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Yes, thats what I have stated that the jamming signal does.</span><br />
[08:22] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: Not everyone knew that you had told Ash that. Not everyone can infere such. Now, what exactly is it you seeked to gain by telling us this?</span><br />
[08:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I don't want you guys getting killed by underlings after more dreamselves die.</span><br />
[08:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Because Its very likely that it will happen.</span><br />
[08:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: And how does that all align with Ash and her predicament of her hearing the Horrorterrors?</span><br />
[08:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Either through murder or god tier.</span><br />
[08:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, thing is...</span><br />
[08:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Last time I mentioned the problems with the horror terrors to ash, she made me wear the earmuffs.</span><br />
[08:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And while it did work, I don't think she got sleep that night.</span><br />
[08:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I felt I needed to mention this since AB's dreamself died and she was asking me about the area.</span><br />
[08:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: I understand, though alchemizing a second pair would have sufficed.</span><br />
[08:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And I told her to stay away.</span><br />
[08:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Problem with that is the grist price.</span><br />
[08:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: Still, what does that have to do with us dying at the hands of underlings?</span><br />
[08:25] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: Torrent it. It's how I afforded a space fairing vessel.</span><br />
[08:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Well, assuming that you try to sleep there to avoid horror terrors, the area is still filled with underlings.</span><br />
[08:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Plus if you get hurt you still can't call for help.</span><br />
[08:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And I don't think there is enough grist in the session.</span><br />
[08:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...last night, I had a dream.</span><br />
[08:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I was out on the docks back on earth. A bunch of crows were on the table and I was sitting on the end.</span><br />
[08:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I fell into the water in the dream.</span><br />
[08:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: thats fucked up</span><br />
[08:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: that aside though</span><br />
[08:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I tried to swim back up, but the plants at the bottom of the lake were tangled around my foot.</span><br />
[08:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: onlyu derse dreamers hear the horrorterrors and even then we cant hear them right now</span><br />
[08:29] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: Ash is an acception to the rule for whatever reason</span><br />
[08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: As I was almost out of breath, I suddenly managed to get enough energy to break free.</span><br />
[08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I got back to land... and couldn't move.</span><br />
[08:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And then the crows started pecking.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: At the end of the pecking, I found myself wishing for all the pain to stop.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...And the end came. In the form of a wolf.</span><br />
[08:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...And thats when I woke up.</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: however poetic or ominous or choose your pint of poison that is</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: im not the one to interpret it</span><br />
[08:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I have stated on multiple occasions that I felt like a fish out of water.</span><br />
[08:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...what if it wasn't the water that was making it difficult to breathe?</span><br />
[08:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I'm over thinking this.</span><br />
[08:34] <span style="color:#55aa00">SE: no shit</span><br />
[08:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Feel free to share this log with the other people that were in the memo.</span><br />
[08:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Just don't let ash find out.</span><br />
[08:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[FL]</span> stopped messaging suddenlyEchoes <span style="color:#55aa00">[SE]</span> at 20:35 --</span><br />
