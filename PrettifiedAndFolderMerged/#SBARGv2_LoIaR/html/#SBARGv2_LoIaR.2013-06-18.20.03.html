<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: why hello</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ((...opps. thought this was general))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even if I was a Seer of Mind, I don't think I'd be able to parse just what is going through his thinkpan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why do I feel like I've gone through this kind of frustration before in the memo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does this have to do with that weird post I found on my blog?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: you mean that whole convoluted plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: hrm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: what weird post might you be referring to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it mentioned something about a guy that didn't even exist or something like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: I didn't quite notice any in particular</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: ((was that retconned and I just completely missed that?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah, retconned, but parsed as a doomed timeline))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((TJ was retgoned by group vote, but IC counted as doomed timeline))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((so technically it didn't happen in the alpha))</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: ((gotcha))</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: most perplexing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: perhaps it was the glitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...you think AC's sanity is bugged?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it sounds like it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: I was referring to that post...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: personally I find his exploits to be too utterly convoluted to even follow</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, how are his alternateselves not rebelling or anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: an intersting thought...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: one would think that the alternate timeclones...</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: being from presumably doomed timelines</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: would all want to be the alpha, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, Davesprite was kinda bummed but got over it... but that was only one Doomed Dave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: this shithive-maggots guy made 100.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and aradia, she was already dead so the apethy is sorta almost justifiable... to a degree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wait. oh frogs, I think I've figured out his plan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there was a grand total of 1000 Doomed Aradiabots, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: you've pieced it together, have you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: something like that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he's going to keep artificially dooming perfectly good timelines, then zerg rush the black king</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and then get all 1.0 kiloasses fed to him by Bakagami.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: except even one must remember that the aradiabots couldn't do it all by themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: because there was also Gamzee... and Vriska...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the Aradiabots basically canceled out the Vast Glub, is what they were mainly used for</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok, nobody give him the access code for our session's grist gutter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or at the very least, set your gristtorrent client to "No Seeding" mode for a bit</span><br />
