<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we got contacted by some ugly guy calling himself "the guardian" almost a year ago who needd our help to put together the game. It took him months to slap a broken messy version together. We entered in March and the gates were messed up. had to wait for the guardian dude to fix them, one by one. It took freaking long and we didn't get to meet eachother until the 2nd gate, which was rigged in a way that some</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">would be stuck in seperate chains. One chump tried to beat the system by flying somewhere else with his rocketscythe, but the guardian didn't like it and took it away with code manipulation. We started to sorta mistrust the guardian after he said he would be fixing things but just made them worse. Eventually though, he asked for our sprites to power a battery for his cheat machine. Turns out he was playing us &lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ HIT THE DECK /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">all for fools, blew up the battery and was actually a timespace weirdo guy called Chronos. He trapped the real first guardian in a ball that we had to unlock somehow. Since he's been around, the glitches have been fixed steadily, but he doesn't really do very much in between bugfixes. Eventually though, the rocketscythe chump started killing dreamselves left and right, posting encoded messages on a blog after &lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">almost every hit. Turns out he was in cahoots with chronos or something like that. Eventually though, a sylph of doom known as SV faced off against him, using a fraymotif that worked prety much just like destiny bond to take him down with him. Of course, both of them were taken to thier respective quest beds, but it proved that we could fight back. Apparently though, the chump was tossed into a lotus time </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">capsule which we were told led to some sorta candyland, but now I'm not even sure because the latest thing on Ornis's blog says that the chump was sent back to Earth using that thing. Meanwhile, we're doing dungeon crawls all the time, trying to save up enough for the ultimate alchemy, gathering the frogs before the Reckoning, which might happen in a couple weeks, and try not to get too insane. ➜</span><br />
