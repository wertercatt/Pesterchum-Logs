<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Agreed.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I swear to god if another person makes that Joke I will smash a pumpkin on there head when I can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we could try stealing them from Chronos a couple months ago before they ran out, but then he'd probably pull that "I see you" thing and take us out then and there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would be best to wait about 5 months.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...I was completly serious, FL. what pumpkins.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it*</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: We could do that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Just think about it. we notify our past selves about this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Thats not the only thing we have to be worried about, FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then we fuck over this timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: And slay chronos when he was still weak, or we run the guardian release code earlier.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SV, we are not doing this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would DIE.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I mean, cronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL =/= Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I misspelled. sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The best plan is to tell our past selves to send us the code, saying we need the pumpkin for shinanigans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And tell them NOTHING ELSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Course, this needs to be a forgetful person...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or a person who remembers giving the code.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or we hop about 5 months into the future and grab the code for a pumpkin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Anyways, why did Cronos need the codes relating to aspects?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH GOD.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Indeed.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...am I really the first one ot think of this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, probably the first one to talk about it in the memo</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: How much control over the power, I dunno.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Lets be glad he didn't get the classes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Otherwise we would have a Lord of Omega.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: He's already a lord.... which my be a good thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, is he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We are not sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...Lord of Time, who stole the domain of space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: At least, according to the storybook I have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But if he were to get every classpect... It would be like that one fanfic that the guy turned into lord english... before we knew who he was, of course.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where the guy took every Heir's power?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Over several sessions?</span><br />
