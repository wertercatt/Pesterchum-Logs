<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...CP, what did I ask.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just asking you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. uh... I'm trying to remember too...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I know SJ said it had something to do with that one dream you pastebinned a while ago...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but what did I say?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: something about... "wolf... save me from the raven..." I think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh my god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...did I... really ask that?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I was thinking about the dream at the time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I just kind of broke down when I realized what your mind-controlled self was talking about...</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  ........ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the only thing that makes sense if you compare it to the dream.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... and I think that's why I just froze when you said it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't think we should talk about this anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably a good idea...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Didn't you say you had a Pit of 100 Trials on your land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, but the entrance is event-flagged to only open after facing my denizen the second time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well maybe we should try my pit then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Door is wide open... through there are a huge number of signs warning not to go in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then maybe we should heed them... for now, at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Right.</span><br />
