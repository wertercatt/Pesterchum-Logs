I'll let it and if nothing happens set up a boot disk<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, it is a very Bad Idea to interrupt a system repair so just let it sit and do its thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: hey\l/</span><br />
Is there a reason OSes go down to the smallest resilution while repairing?<br />
Seems silly<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think it's to use as little processing power as possible for the screen so most of it can go to the actual repair...</span><br />
But GPUs?<br />
Are a thing?<br />

I can't smilies because this keyboard has an awkward enter key that messes up my muscle memory<br />

The hardware light on the side is blinking though so something's happening?<br />

Though the hardware light hasn'<br />
Screen went black again<br />
