<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me se if I can recall exactly what went down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *see</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it all started apparently when RS mentioned the true name of "Bakagami", which unfortunately was something that set her off for some reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that led to her running away from home, leaving almost all her stuff behind</span><br />
