<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Man there's a difference between sensitive and dealing with a huge dickhole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that, and she's in no mood to deal with that today. she DID tier a few hours ago, after all...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh shit she did</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: this is gonna be tough</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ughhhhhhh</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Bluh bluh can't be bothered.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hey Rob when's this whole meeting thing tomorrow</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>theres a meeting?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: For what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Afternoon, probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Recaping and deciding on this whole course of action bullshit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: First of what'll hopefully be weekly meetings, too. Just 'cause.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Kay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: And Trying to find good music?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And not recaping the /entire session/ because that's dumb, not getting sidetracked by somebody's desire to go /camping/ or fainting</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well, I hope at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We're supposed to be a team but for the most part we're a bunch of fucks faffing around in our own individual corners not really /doing/ much of anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: With a few notable exceptions but regardless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So, weekly meetings. Some structure might do us good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm probably gonna have to miss it this time, so could someone get me a log or something after it's over?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((got a thing to do w/ grandparents tomorrow))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah if it's in the afternoon I can't be there</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah... and ill feel more confident apologizing to fa in person :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: JA<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>Wait, why ddn't we do this SOONER.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Like when FI was attacking people?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Because the common idea was to sit on our hands</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: but there were meetings</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just not huge ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There was a plan in the works to hunt him down but then Hank did his thing and save us from our own horrid ignorance.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Ah okay<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ignorance he was complacent in but hey details right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What matters is he made a shitty post and some stupid comments acting like there was any chance people would leave him to die and not tier him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i didnt even bother fighting him :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: me either, but mostly because it would've been sudokucidal for me to try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean when he came for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Hank was probably one of the few that COULD fight Seth safely, and he /still/ got taken out in the process.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i knew i wasnt gonna win, so i didnt even bother</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I tried Punching Cronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Did not end well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: that would have been giving him what he wanted</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, you tried punching him? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yes. Yes I did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is such /bullshit/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /fuck/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: After He Killed TT's DreamSelf.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: let me guess, during the tea party that I didn't get to go to due to stupid sidequests and lack of comunication. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /yeah/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ._. man</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: and apparently that was the /cue/ or whatever for Hank to hop in and martyr himself</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Yeah. TT's death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Last on the list.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hes the only motherfucker here i like so</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe you should try not like, constantly insulting people. Might work out better. I mean hell even today FA didn't deserve ALL that bullshit she was getting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah i know</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i try to keep right at the edge of actually deeply hurting people but</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: sometimes i go over</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and im sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She'll get over it, people'd have to be insane to hold it against you for/ever/ but</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Not doing that is a good plan for the future</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and i also didnt realize she had just tiered so</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Kind of hard to hold ignorance against somebody, again, she'll get over it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm sure she didn't get eaten by wolves but it probably sucked, so give people who just died some space</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually, it seems like the main thing about it is not that her denizen killed her, but that in the process of ascending, she became part raven.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I don't really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and she's trying to adjust to that, like I had to adjust when I self-prototyped</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: See what that has to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh, like, emotions or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk, just a theory</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Birds have fragile emotions Rob</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Check your human priviledge</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well i adjusted to tiering pretty easily but i didnt get crazy combined with anything so</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...It did strike me as odd, her reaction. She seems a lot more emotionally crumbly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably being tiered with Ashsprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The whole "past her" thing I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ashsprite was pretty emotionally crumbly</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the fact that shes well... a sensitive person in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So you've probably got a lot of backlash all pent up</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i deserve it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah probably. But really, she'll be fine given some hours or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or not, I'm not a psychic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: understand that i never mean to hurt people</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i like pointing out peoples flaws and kinda teasing them about it, but i do it to help them improve</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: like even if my calling her a tightass is a bit over the line, ash really does need to lighten the fuck up</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're like a less vindictive me and I find that revelation horrifying ._.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i am all of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: my spirit is within the universe</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: everybody here is a flawed motherfucker, myself included</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and ive found mocking people for their flaws makes them want to prove me wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: youre welcome you ungrateful pieces of shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so you think you're doing them a favor by insulting them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, thank you? &gt;_&gt; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: See, I used to think that. Then I realized that people, when their flaws are brought up, are far more likely to either do one of two things</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 1. Curl up into a pile of sad and say "No he's wrong" until they become a shallow husk of that one flaw you pointed out</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP:  <span style="color:#008141">There Are Not Enough Finish Crumbs In Paradox Space To Describe My Opinion About That</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or 2. Actively try to improve themselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but if the first is their reaction, then can anything get them to change?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No</span><br />
