<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, well, we have to fine everything we can find.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And since we have an unlimited amount of cruxite, it doesn't drain resources.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Other than space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ True... ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like having a cobblestone generator in minecraft.</span><br />

<span style="color:#000050">CAM: [ A slight change in the other presence ]</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, something as simple as eye color.</span><br />
