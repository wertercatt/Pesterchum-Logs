<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  a frigid landscape fades into view outside of the number sphere. the sky is clear and the stars are dazzling. the ground is flat and covered in an iced over layer of snow. the wind is blowing. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaand, we're here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2d8a18">CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat [CSL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  looking around in awe --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... I used to go to this spot quite a bit while I was gone away from the group... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: one of those rare pockets without pollution... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...pollution?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... There's quite a bit of industrial development on this planet... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: wait, were on another planet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well duh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we're obviously not at the spaceport anymore. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...good point</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  scratches back of head --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so yeah. Welcome to Jingloria. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: circa quite a long time ago. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats where those elves came from, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: nice place</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... kinda sucks they got rained on by the game-day parade... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: shit happens, i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  smiles and squeezes her hand --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks over at SL and smiles --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so how much is there in this area, anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it goes on for quite a few miles, though it gets to a point where the cold is almost unbearable. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: maybe without any body heat</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, I think I took a thermometer out there once and it said like... -100 degrees or something? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((brb, something came up irl))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((shouldnt take too long sorry))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((got it))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((ok back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((welcome back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ah well, got the cheesy line out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hehe... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...so how come this place isn't polluted like everywhere else here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's too cold for trains and stuff to make it out here, so without reliable transportation, there really isn't enough infastructure to build here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: so coldest place on the ice planet, huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've seen some companies try to develop out here, and they all failed. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...whats it like, being able to see so much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like, with time powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's... kinda cool, but sorta bittersweet I guess. Like, I've seen these guys build up their society quite a bit from the quick peeks here and there... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: sometimes i wish my powers came with cool stuff like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: your powers seem to have some cool perks to it too. didn't you like, get to design a good chunk of the flora and fauna on starter planet? I vaguely remember when you decided the grass would be hot pink. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: heh, yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh yeah, that reminds me, ive got a present for you when we get back</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i meant to give it to you on our first date, but the moment never really came up</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, okay then... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: gotta say too, life powers dont really seem to come with as many... rules as time powers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: like they have limits and things they can and cant do, but i dont have to worry about timelines and whatever else you have to deal with</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that sounds about right. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i feel like it has to be a little stressful</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stressful is an understatement. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: knowing that if you arent careful you might break something in the fabric of time...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... one wrong step and everything goes crashing down. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i know i couldnt handle that sort of responsibility</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I never told anyone this but...  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: apparently the first time I ever used time travel... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, it wasn't the first time... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was the first time I saw myself use time travel... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways... that first time, apparently I didn't jump correctly or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I found her in the bushes outside of the HQ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I never told anyone because well... I didn't want anyone to freak out... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  pulls Niki into a hug --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  hugs back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...thanks. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: youre so brave, being able to keep going after something like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it's not like I have a choice in the matter... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have to keep going for you guys... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: it had to have taken a hell of a lot of willpower, though</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: you didnt have to keep it to yourself for so long, you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sometimes I wish I didn't have to deal with my responsabilities... but at the same time, who would be able to take my place? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why did you keep doing it after the game ended, though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: wouldnt all of your timeloops have ended by then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you'd think so... but with such a lack of productive things to do, I kinda fell into the habit again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...will it ever end, do you think?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: who knows... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: will you ever be able to close all the timeloops youve made?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can only try... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i wish i could help</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just being there helps out a lot, you know. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...thanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...sorry for being such a depressing blob tonight. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: dont worry about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda got reminded of some stuff from that recording... and being here just sorta opened up the floodgate again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: its good you got it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I used to vent quite a bit on my blog a while back... I guess I slipped out of the habit though. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im always here for you to vent at if you need to</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thanks... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...so any landmarks or anything around here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, in this particular area... not that much. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: wanna just take a walk, maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sure. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  breaks off the hug and holds out his hand, smiling --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  accepts his hand and smiles back --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  heads off in an essentially random direction --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  follows alongside --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...so i gotta ask, had you ever taken anybody with you into the past before?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, a couple times here and there to help out with some stuff. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: did you have any idea if it was going to work the first time you did it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I didn't stop to think that it wouldn't work. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I just, sorta went with my gut feeling and brought the crew along for the ride. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: seems uncharacteristically spontaneous for you</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, we were on a trip to find my brother, and there was no way I was leaving everyone behind when I found out we'd have to hop back a couple months to rescue him. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: still, id think youd be too worried about it going wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I always doublecheck stuff, and before I started even dabbling in time travel while in the session I did a ton of research. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  smiles and nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: thats what i figured</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I still wonder what happened to my brother... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...did you not find him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no.... still haven't found him. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...once we get back ill help you work on that</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright then. Thanks. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we should probably get somewhere warm soon. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah... i assume you know a way back</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, I have an anchor artifact that leads back to the spacepaort. ➜</span><br />
