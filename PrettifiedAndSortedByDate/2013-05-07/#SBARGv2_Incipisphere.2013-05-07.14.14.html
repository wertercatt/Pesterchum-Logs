<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I must have eaten something bad...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The consorts invited me to a party... I couldn't say no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nor could I say no to the food and drinks they kept bringing me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: :C</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I didn't see any mold on the bread...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who knew they could grow wheat?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I don't even remember how I got home.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Did one of you guys... wait, there isn't a gate leading to my land... At least, I don't think so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did one of you guys pick me up in a space van or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, I'll askh again later when more people are on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: maybe you ate a weird bug without realizing it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But all I had were mushroom sandwiches and those awesome drinks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess I bug could have burrowed into the mushrooms...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But the consorts had a bunch too!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, they were coming and going, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I was at the table the longest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: well, it could also be overeating I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, maybe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so, which one of you picked me up again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I'll go ask my sprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He says that I came in by myslef...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I'm just glad mushrooms aren't part of my consorts' food... otherwise I'd have to get more food from Ammysprite and the alchemiter than I already do</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Is that the Ammy from the Okami games?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess maybe our sprites might get along?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its my dog + cruxite...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...you post-entry prototyped a cruxite dowel?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, pre.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: that's kind of a weird thing to use</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The cruxite was the only thing I had time to throw in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Carved too.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I'm heading back to the HQ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, when you start SBURB when you can see the meteor in the distance, you barely have enough time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I still needed to run around the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV:  <a href='#SBARGv2LoHaN'>#SBARGv2LoHaN</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Hm.. I was relatively prepared.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Uh, thats not where the HQ is. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: (( That's where SV is. Aswell as SJ and TT. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( The hq is on TT's land... ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Okay. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I am a derp. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: but yeah, most of my consorts' food is either vodka or some weird cubic stuff that is labeled as "Space Food" when captcha'd... like this <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/mspa/captcha_spacefood.png'>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52541782/mspa/captcha_spacefood.png</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Well, when you say your going to the HQ... ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: it's an acquired taste, but better than risking eating mushrooms</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Thats sounds like its from super paper mario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((thousand-year door actually))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((my consorts are basically Fahr Outpost Bob-Ombs))</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Ah. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So- wait, did you say vodka?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SO THAT EXPAINS IT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wheat is also used to make booze... so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess it makes sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...that also expains why I feel sick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fLmun <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  throws up. again. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: oh, word of advice: NEVER DO VODKA &amp;&amp; SAKE. the resulting explosion gives basically roxy-tier drunkenness to everyone within a ten-foot radius</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Your kidding, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMO</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...well, I think its over...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Okay, thats cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I checked my modus... apparenly, I bought a large amount of crap when I was heading back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Green Mushroom Shake... Steak... Hamburger... Pink Mushroom... Mango... A large ammount of apples... Wow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, the shake has chunks of uncooked mushroom in it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ▲aaah, I kind of lefτ wiτhouτ noτice, I'm sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Turns out the consorts got me drunk.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, this is directed to myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: F_L</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm... according to the ingredient modus, I can make quite a few things with these apples.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: hmm. apparently, eating a weird bug is the incipisphere's cure for any status effect, from mushroom allergic reaction to the octoroon rangoon</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: just a Weird Bug. it's weird, and it's a bug. that's about all there is to say on the matter. also it tastes the same as the smell of wet dog. bluh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's...interesting if not slightly gross</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And you ate it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: does iτ τalk</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: no, it's just a food item. think the Jar of Bugs from [S] John: Enter Village</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So...you DIDN'T eat it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: no, but it's good to know that's what I have to do if I go onto another player's land and a consort accidentally gives me food with mushrooms in it</span><br />
