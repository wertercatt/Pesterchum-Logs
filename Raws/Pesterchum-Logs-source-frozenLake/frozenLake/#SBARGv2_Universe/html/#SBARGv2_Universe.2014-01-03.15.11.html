If we can't go back, and we just lost use of alchemy, the next step for paradox space to try to kill us off would be to delete objects created by alchemy, and if it decided to /really/ decide to be a dick... remove aspect powers.</span><br />

[03:15:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Without alchemy, we will be unable to power DS's ship.</span><br />

[03:15:26] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -well, no.</span><br />
[03:15:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And a large amount of other methods of travel.</span><br />
[03:15:47] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Replicators still work, right? The hard-coded stuff?</span><br />
[03:16:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Replicators do work, but you need original materal and they require a power source.</span><br />
[03:16:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: replicators were alchemized, but are not Sburb Tech themselves.</span><br />
[03:16:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and yeah, the raw-material thing</span><br />
[03:16:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What about the Golden Node?</span><br />
[03:16:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does that still work?</span><br />
[03:16:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, I... think so? I don't have anything to test it with right now though...</span><br />
[03:17:05] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: golden what? ➜</span><br />
[03:17:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if it stops working, we should find out as soon as the internet drops out.</span><br />
[03:17:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Golden SkaiaNet Hub</span><br />
[03:17:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically a battery that never runs out.</span><br />
[03:17:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: something that Crux and I alchemized during an alchemy mini-binge on Prospit</span><br />
[03:17:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, that thing. ➜</span><br />
[03:18:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, I need you to promise me this.</span><br />
[03:18:13] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
[03:18:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If the powernodes cut out, I need you to go back and stop us from entering the new universe, through any means necessary.</span><br />
[03:18:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Such as pestering yourself.</span><br />
[03:19:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, I don't think that's a very good solution., ➜</span><br />
[03:19:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL, that is a stupid idea.</span><br />
[03:19:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SJ, its better than me ripping off your leg.</span><br />

[03:20:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We can deal with no alchemy, but if we lose power, we are boned.</span><br />
[03:20:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's ways to generate power legit, have you forgotten 6th grade science class? ➜</span><br />
[03:21:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...might be a tad bit over reacting.</span><br />
[03:21:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: "might"</span><br />
[03:21:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well yeah, we could rebuild the infirstructure back on earth, but without the golden power node, we won't have access to Beta Earth internet for assistance.</span><br />
[03:22:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, a secondary option would be to use my godtier revivals as a battery...</span><br />
[03:22:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but that could cut out as well.</span><br />
[03:22:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O ➜</span><br />

[03:22:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh</span><br />
[03:23:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A large amount of energy is released as heat and light when a god tier revives.</span><br />
[03:23:37] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL. As stated before, there are easy ways to generate power. Just calm down, and stop going over-the-top with paranoia.</span><br />
[03:23:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...wait shit that could be considered heroic</span><br />
[03:24:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EQ, there are easy ways to get power, but none on the level for space travel.</span><br />
[03:24:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you plan on building a space ship that uses coal to travel faster than light.</span><br />
[03:24:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (starbound is /stupid/)</span><br />
[03:25:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you just FA wing there? ➜</span><br />
[03:25:39] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah, but its not like any of us are on a strict schedule. We have a ton of time. Besides, we would only really need enough power to send people safely through the transportalizers.</span><br />
[03:25:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Did I?</span><br />
[03:25:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, I think that was unintentional, like :O in parens with no space becomes <span style="color:#2b0057">:O)</span></span><br />
[03:26:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hannah, /we/ might not have a time limit, but the consorts and Rob have limited life spans.</span><br />
[03:26:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you want to freeze them solid or upload them to computers.</span><br />
[03:26:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: EQ, I thought transportalizers were self-powered through shenanigans or something?</span><br />
[03:27:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: CP, i dont know. Maybe? If thats the case, then my point still stands.</span><br />
[03:27:11] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You do not need to be so paranoid FL.</span><br />
[03:27:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...how was that last bit paranoid.</span><br />
[03:27:26] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You can just send people through those to safety.</span><br />
[03:27:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Without FTL, it would take... what is the fastest Project Orion could launch spaceships at?</span><br />
[03:27:54] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -I'm saying as a general, you are acting kinda paranoid. :/</span><br />
[03:28:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Note that Project Orion was basically propelling spaceships with nukes.</span><br />
[03:28:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And is the fastest method other than warp drive.</span><br />
[03:31:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean we could obviously use space and time players to combine time dialation (at incredibly high speeds) with time travel to get places before we even left, sooo</span><br />
[03:32:42] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, that sounds like a cool idea ➜</span><br />
[03:33:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But with the slim case that aspect powers might fade as well makes that... terrifying.</span><br />
[03:33:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't wanna be stuck 50 million lightyears away from home with /sublight/ engines, thank you very much.</span><br />
[03:33:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like Condy after the Vast Glub?</span><br />
[03:33:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[03:34:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm pretty sure that aspect powers just nee a recharge after extended use. ➜</span><br />
[03:34:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *need ➜</span><br />
[03:34:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...also shit, what happens if the game makes not only aspect powers fade, but /prototyping/ powers as well?</span><br />
[03:35:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (dammit FL now you got ME being paranoid too!)</span><br />
[03:35:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right, but I'm saying on the slight chance we lose our aspect powers like what Chronos was worried about so much which caused the issue in /his/ session.</span><br />
[03:35:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh my god I'm chronostier paranoid.</span><br />
[03:35:38] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah uh</span><br />
[03:35:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...either that or he was right, but that makes me sound even more paranoid.</span><br />
[03:36:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: brb, facepalming ➜</span><br />
[03:36:13] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: sigh</span><br />
[03:37:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, if this all comes to pass and I lose /both/ my power sets, I'm blaming you... assuming I can even still speak then, if it happened while I was in wolf form.</span><br />
[03:38:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If that comes to pass I want you to kill me since there is no possible way I'm going to stand being on this planet with the reward stripped.</span><br />
[03:40:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless it forces us to keep immortality after we lose our powers in that case I'm likely going to snap and start stabbing.</span><br />
[03:40:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, Gambit Tier with the stabbing.</span><br />
[03:43:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...actually, DS' consorts would have to translate for me if that happened...</span><br />
[03:43:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I don't think Paradox Space would go /that/ far to punish us, FL.</span><br />
[03:44:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it may be a dick sometimes, but it's not flat-out malevolent. if it was, it would've sent LE into our session before Chronos had even shown up.</span><br />
[03:45:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think it tried but LE killed Chronos's frog. At least thats what Brown had said in his.</span><br />
[03:47:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He could have been lying though.</span><br />
[03:51:59] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I heard it was a dude dressed up as lord english, but that's probably just me. ➜</span><br />
[03:52:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So a Cosplayer?</span><br />
[03:53:02] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I dunno, maybe? ➜</span><br />
[03:53:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably</span><br />
[03:55:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suppose its the most simple explanation</span><br />
[03:55:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, I'd like to see /you/ power a spaceship with coal.</span><br />
[03:57:29] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  takes one lump of coal, obtains a lump of anti-coal through shenanigans, then flings them at each other --</span><br />
