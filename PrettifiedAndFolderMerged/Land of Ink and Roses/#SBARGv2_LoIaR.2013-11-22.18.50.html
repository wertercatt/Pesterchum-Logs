DS: the people who didn't get a copy<br />
DS: why are we alive and they aren't?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because chronos played a sick joke on the few who were stupid enough to follow it. ➜</span><br />
DS: it was a video game, they didn't know they were going to die<br />
DS: they got killed by meteors<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: most of them didn't even know the game was even a thing. ➜</span><br />

DS: like punching bags<br />
DS: but they give you money<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but there's not really a reason to fight them anymore. We're not training for anything in particular. ➜</span><br />
DS: I understand what you're saying<br />
DS: so what do you think our universe is going to be?<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think it's going to be a zillion miles of space, gajillions of planets and stars too far apart from eachother to acknowledge eachother's existance, and then even more space after that. ➜</span><br />
DS: touché<br />
DS: will it have aliens in it?<br />
