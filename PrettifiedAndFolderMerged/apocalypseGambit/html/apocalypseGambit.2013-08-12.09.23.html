[09:23:31] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: Hey. What's going on, dude?</span><br />
[09:23:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...What do the aliens sound like?</span><br />
[09:24:11] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: ...</span><br />
[09:24:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Are they like when we discuss hotel stuff that isn't said by our characters??</span><br />
[09:24:58] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: On the memo, it looks like there's something there. Something I can't quite /see/, marked by the mysterious parentheses. I can get the general gist of it, though.</span><br />
[09:25:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...ah...</span><br />
[09:25:34] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: In person, sometimes I can /hear/ them whispering. Like someone's talking in the background, but there's a lot of radio static. You can't quite hear it properly, just know it's /there/, make out a few words here and there.</span><br />
[09:25:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: but... is it like out of character discussion on the hotel memo?</span><br />
[09:25:48] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: But… the parentheses look the same as that.</span><br />
[09:25:50] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: Yeah.</span><br />
[09:25:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...</span><br />
[09:25:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Thank you.</span><br />
[09:26:07] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: Why?</span><br />
[09:26:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...If our hotel characters could see our discussion, how do you think they would react?</span><br />
[09:27:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: To being inside of a fantasy world?</span><br />
[09:27:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: To cease to exist when we are done?</span><br />
[09:28:14] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: … 'Lana probably wouldn't care. I've played a rendition of her before in a tabletop where a god spoke of character sheets and them defining the chars' existences. Her goal in life became to find hers and sneak a peek.</span><br />
[09:28:22] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: And it's not like they cease to exist.</span><br />
[09:28:30] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: They're still there, in that universe we've written for them.</span><br />
[09:28:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Maybe your right...</span><br />
[09:28:37] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: We just don't play with them anymore.</span><br />
[09:28:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...What if we are the same way?</span><br />
[09:29:02] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: That doesn't mean they go away… and what if we are?</span><br />
[09:29:14] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: I'm the daughter of a philosophy professor.</span><br />
[09:29:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...If we are, then what happens when the aliens go away?</span><br />
[09:29:42] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: I've been hearing "what ifs" like this since I could understand. I don't /care/ anymore.</span><br />
[09:30:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: What happens to a videogame character when he is no longer played with?</span><br />
[09:30:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: what happens after he finishes his story?</span><br />
[09:30:44] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: There's sequels and shit. Stuff happens in the years between those. I always assumed that hey, they just moved on with their lives.</span><br />
[09:30:55] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: We may not be able to /see/ them...</span><br />
[09:31:02] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: But there's an entire universe. Stories. Plots.</span><br />
[09:31:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: fan fiction.</span><br />
[09:31:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: /shitty/ fan fiction.</span><br />
[09:31:19] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: You don't just finish a story-- the viewers just stop being able to see what you do.</span><br />
[09:31:55] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: Once you're put into a universe, with the characters I write anyway, you're there forever, doing your own thing, even if I don't play you anymore.</span><br />
[09:32:19] <span style="color:#538d79">AG: Also shitty fanfics, yeah.</span><br />
[09:32:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...thank you.</span><br />
