[04:58:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or Blood and Breath</span><br />
[04:58:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or Doom and Life</span><br />

[05:00:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we ever get the chance, we are making Chronos the Seer of Piss and Blood</span><br />
[05:01:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or would he be a waste?</span><br />
[05:01:22] <span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: that is the grossest title ever. ew. ➜</span><br />
[05:01:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /exactly/</span><br />

[05:02:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he's the Douche class. the skaianet devs coded it specifically for him, just like only FedoraFreak can be Gent.</span><br />
[05:02:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Huss of Lips, the Gent of Piss and the Waste of Space.</span><br />
[05:02:37] <span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞ Or Waste of Breath? :V Σ</span><br />
[05:02:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No</span><br />

[05:03:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except Wastes strip their aspect from enemies.</span><br />
[05:04:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like How Hussie was stripping the possibility of a new beginning from the kids, and how he stripped the powers from a first guardian.</span><br />

[05:05:46] <span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: huss of lips ➜</span><br />
[05:05:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hussie is both the Huss of Lips and the Waste of Space.</span><br />
[05:08:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If a Space player normally creates a new beginning, gives birth to a new universe... "I gave you life, now I'm ripping it away because I can't control my power."</span><br />
[05:08:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />

[05:36:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, that homestuck potato</span><br />
[05:36:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
[05:36:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that basically is what emergency plan theta is.</span><br />
[05:36:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[05:37:00] <span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: NOPE ➜</span><br />
[05:38:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except Id be going back and branching the alpha... but then I would be stopped by doomed chronos...</span><br />
[05:38:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that is why Emergency Plan Theta /sucks/</span><br />
[05:39:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because as soon as I would arrive I would die before I could change anything.</span><br />
[05:39:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[05:39:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless the entire change happened in a single moment</span><br />

[05:39:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: before it could be changed.</span><br />
[05:39:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: two frames of existance.</span><br />
[05:40:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps only a single trollian message.</span><br />
[05:40:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...but plan sucks anyway</span><br />
[05:45:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, even if we told them over the memo about Chronos and to be nice to seth... would we really do it?</span><br />
[05:45:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or would be be more suspicious about Seth?</span><br />
[05:45:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we be*</span><br />
[05:47:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Why would my heart keep going back to this plan?</span><br />
[05:47:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I /know/ its stupid...</span><br />

[06:00:15] <span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: the heart wants what the heart wants and the heart is prone to wanting the happy ending...the version where everyone is okay</span><br />

[06:00:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: so when he comes back can we kill him</span><br />
[06:01:10] <span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: and if a thief of heart does what it sounds like...it'd be hard for you to accept that your heart can't always have what it wants...........</span><br />
