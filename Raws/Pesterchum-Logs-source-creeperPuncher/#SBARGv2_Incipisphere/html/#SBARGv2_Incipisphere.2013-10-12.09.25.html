<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also btw, I thought Virtual Porkhollow couldn't wire to your own past self, you had to use someone outside the session as a middleman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hence the hesitaiton ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And no one's answered my question of /would a dead Player's Denizen's hoard make up for it/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I wouldn't know, Gambit...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ash assumes that we need all the hoards in the entire session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Gambit, I was assuming so... but Ash said EVERY LAND'S HOARD is required</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We either need to get all the dead Players' Denizens' hoards /anyway/, or they're-- oh jeez.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That a session with more players needs more to make a universe of the same size.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which /doesn't make a lick of sense/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So we've got to go around and kill/bargain with… every Denizen? Well, this Session has fewer Players now. So a smaller universe might work.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Going to the code room and cheating in grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually FL, if we do need all the land-hoards... what'd make slightly more sense is if every universe-frog needed a specific amount of grist, which is then divided evenly among all the denizens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I doubt that would work. Checksums and all that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so in a large session like ours, each individual hoard is significantly smaller than a single hoard in, say, the Hivebent session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Athena was able to hack the session apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe we should ask her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: to a limited degree ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I sent in a question to Ornis in case he knows.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Changing the value of grist count in someone's possession should be a simple matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think I have an idea though. If we can get everyone, including the more soitary folks who don't even frequent the memo to kick into high-ger regarding grist accumulation, we'll be able to make this go by faster. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, the active list says about 41 last time I checked? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My three year estimate involved 24 players.</span><br />
<span style="color:#78120b">CDS: ((ah))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because there are so many Denizens out there. So many Players who've stopped by /once/ or twice then died or disappeared.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Having to kill their Denizens or bargain with them for grist sounds… nonsensical.</span><br />
