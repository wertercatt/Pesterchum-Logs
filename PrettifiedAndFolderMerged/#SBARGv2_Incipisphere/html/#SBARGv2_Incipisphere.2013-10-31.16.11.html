<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i used to work on cars and play baseball</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Studying, Computers generally and Law insofar as careers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I played videogames all day and partook in a Homestuck RP on Formspring, before it crumbled and we jumped ship to ask.fm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: video game dev at a startup company. we did a minecraft mod initially, then we decided to make our own game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Well... I was JUST about to finish High School. Was in the photography club, along witht he computer club and a few others. Didn't know what I was gonna do in life. Also played video game and read books.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: this one time i went to a star wars convention</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: btw, I've been wondering for a while now... the fuck IS formspring anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#300661">CTT: I was jusτ a jobless person who can draw mediocre anime doodles</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Formspring is a website... thats kinda like tumblr.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except there was no way to reblog.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i used to be a camp counselor too because my dad was like ex-military</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I used to roleplay a lot too. Generally tried to go for the villain.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...I can totally see that, Gambit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: and then i was in school doing chemistry for virology </span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Raz, my life was computers, playing viola, writing, school, and also computers. I didn't get out much. That /was/ actual stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah I meant the others</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But I did RPing too if that stuff counts. Relatively obscure fora, Gamefaqs funnily enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, other than game dev stuff, I just hung out at the college, going to club meetings even though I wasn't taking classes anymore...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh yeah, thats kinda where I got my start, Rob.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Gamefaqs RP/FF?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I started making decent characters when I got into Homestuck Roleplay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Mine was Kingdom hearts. God, My Oc was... bleh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We all gotta start somewhere… I was on a forum for the Maximum Ride books. Couple of 'em. Got into doing OC stuff with interesting plots and… definitely got a lot better over the few years I was there, haha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i've never roleplayed but maybe i should sometime</span><br />
<span style="color:#300661">CTT: I RP'd horrible ΘCs, τhen moved τo..uhh...a Touhou characτer in a crossover RP group</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i only knew that was a fetish </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think everyone sucked when they started roleplay- what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Don't even get me started on meh KH OCs my guy dual-wielded fire and ice keyblades and had shadow and light powers</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: just about the perfect little snowflake</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: MV, what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think Hotel has been my first real RP, actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: hahahaha his dad disappeared too, just to complete the obligatory convinently tragic backstory</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Heh. Mine was a Heartless/Nobody Duo, who used to be the same person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: yeah roleplay fetishes and shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: My first char was a twelve-year-old girl who accidentally stumbled into a… bank robbery, I think it was, cor that was long ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: There was like nothing special about her and she got taken hostage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Holy shit Alex</span><br />
