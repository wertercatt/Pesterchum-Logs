<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Yes, wut is it, FS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: listening</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  do you have any notes on consort language that I can borrow?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ... I managed to grab some tablets from the wreckage of yesterday</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...wreckage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and have quite honestly been trying to drown out all my problems in trying to decipher them and figure out what the script on them means</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#730e8f">CURRENT fierySwallow [CFS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: is this ringing any bells for you, FF?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: uh... why do ya ask?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: I can ask my consorts to help ya.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Why don't ya ask ya own consorts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: they're sorta still don't like him I think </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: at least that's my guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I've exhausted all my leads in finding them at the moment actually</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  that was the only village I happened upon in my travels before I decided to leave the planet alltogether</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  with any luck there are probably more villages down there though</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...why did ya do that, FS?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  consult SJ's hypothesis</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Make them like you!</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  at least I unwittingly gave them good reason not to like me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and googness I am not going to explain it again</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Another dude accidently killed on his consorts. could be worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think that was the guy, FF</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ,,,</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: haven't heard of anyone else having that issue.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#d9dc15">CURRENT glyphicTranslator [CGT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: What issue?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I like your chumhandle</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  can you help me translate consortscript?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...whose?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GT's?</span><br />

<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: It was a referance to my destiny on earth...but- Yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  wunderbar!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  now I've had nothing to really go by for reference save for the other tablets I collected</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Haahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Ok, Is there a way to get them to me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's been real frustrating trying to figure it all out, but I'm gonna try to send them now to see if other lands have a similar written language</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  a fair warning though</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  these were made by moles</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Braile?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Thoes are blind...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Exactly...Mole Briale perhaps?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  don't quite know about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#005500">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: something weird happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: It's the dots and dashes written language for the blind back on Earth</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Mole braile made with claws.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably a shape based language then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Like a touch one, I mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Alot of things here reselmble things found on earth</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: I was suprised my Cathedrals actually looked like Cathedrals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Universal language!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: anyways, sorry about being a little late on this, but thank youfor taking me back home yesterday, FF.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: How?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well my plants don't look earthly, but my structures do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: No problem, Niki.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it's because our architecture uses you know, math and sciences, things that SBURB uses too</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So we get the same kind of architecture because it's programmed with math and shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: All architecture does</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or maybe I've been watching Contact too much</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: If anything it's possibly because we are human.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Or to be put better; from Earth</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Let me ask a better question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ,.. great I forgot it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Architecture doesn't nessicarily need math to be possible</span><br />

<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ badoop</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: But it has those basic principles</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That and physics</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi DP</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966">CDP: ≈&gt;■■▶ what miss</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  well, codes for these were bizarre to read but I think I got it</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: even then, they're not exactly rules, they're more of just guidelines. "Non-Euclidean" is a thing, after all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  H0lkA_4S</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: Hmm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  gAp_4D_0</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: an underscore in a code?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I was surprised too</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, are those even legal in punchcard alchemy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#d9dc15">CGT: They may be glitched.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I don't think so... unless it's an Intellibeam-only code or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: non-IL codes can only use the chars A-Z,a-z,0-9,?,!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  _mLH04E4</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  that was the last one : /</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: alternately, the underscore is a missing character or wildcard, and you have to experiment to figure out what's supposed to be in the blanks</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  makes sense for a void player to figure it out I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  bluuuuuuuurgh back to studying</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, It kinda... adjusts the layout of the holes/</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: i keep spacing ouτ aaaaa</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: that's true. any player can process-of-elimination it, but a Void player might have an intuitive guess for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's okay TT, take it easy for a little while.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: (or alternately, a lucky guess by a Light player like myself :P)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  actually, there's something I've been wondering</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I'ma gonna try some mix 'n match here</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: what ya trying to make?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  these tablets? or some other thing that can help?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  honestly I don't quite know yet</span><br />
