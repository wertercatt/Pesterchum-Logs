<span style="color:#970025">CRS: oh my god</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No we are not doing this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: the guardian is liam neelson</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: waτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: PFFFT</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: too late oh shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: WE ARE NOT LETTING THE TERRORISTS WIN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: LOOK AT THAT HAIR ITS EXACTLY GLORIOUS ENOUGH TO FIT TOO</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: You've all gone mad with Guardian and glitch paranoia</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The terrorists have won</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: .▲.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: plot twist</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: the terrorists were robots</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Programmed BY BIGGER TERRORISTS</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: IRON MAN ANYBODY</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so we are doing this? we are making this happen?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok I'm going to do it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I honestly think that you'll be more likely to injur</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  yup totally called it</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: shit son</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: please be careful</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: DO IT FOR AMERICA.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what america?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ▲merica is noτ here now</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's gone with the pumpkns</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: you might want the code for Science Juice then... IDS Glove Mk 2 [XOR] Engineer's Glove</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am America</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Hold on I have the perfect idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: NV is τhe ▲merica, iτ is him</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Gimme 5 minutes </span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: before I start on the chamber?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This is about to get incredibly patriotic</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: No begin work on the chamber whenever</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok I'll start working on it then.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok to make things lighter i should try to make another ring only combine it with something light to, something that would make it's struchter less dense\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: &amp;&amp;-combine it with a pillow?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wonderful. I have the greatest outfit ever now</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have some seriously patriotic paraphernalia</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: I'll just stick to my basics, suspenders and black tee.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Don't need nothin' else...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Or maybe I'll swap to the kickass red jacket, i dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I have only two outfits (so far): the kabuki costume I entered with, and the snowsuit I alchemized as soon as I saw my land was Frozen Fucking Tundra.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: might come up with something else later, but no ideas so far...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: no I was think lighter than that something like a helium balloon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: or just helium\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: make the ring make thing lighter then air\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: getting codes for bare elements is kinda tricky if they're a non-solid...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so helium balloon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: = so I don't get hyper gravity ring attached to a helium balloon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok I think I have the lighten ring\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: now just to test it to make sure it works\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I'm a little hestent about testing this ring but if i messed up\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm watching with a telescope and some popcorn</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: tht makes me feel some much better about this test Nv\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What? Every true scientist enjoys watching experiments that could blow the universe up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: And I need some popcorn to get some sodium back in my body gosh</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok putting on the ring now\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and I don't feel heavier so it at least has normal wieght\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: now to see it if it make a local lighter gravity\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok one two three\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok wow yes this works\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: now to wait till I stop my upwards movement and can land\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: new plan I'm going to grab my roof because i'm not stopping\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Ok test successful\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I think\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok now to make a device that can channel the affects of both rings and if done correctly can make one able to set the gravity in the room\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok a spell ampifier and area affect creator\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: make the spell affects only in a certain room\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i think I can come up with something\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok TT can i have the code for some wands?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ kind</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: just a wand i can put into this device to cannel the rings energy to use for a hyper gravity chamber room\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, I'm going to take a long nap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Ciao, mates.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: later\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: bye..</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNV</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I don'τ know if any of τhe needles I alchemized would be safe τo use...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: why not?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: a)one of τhem is powered by curses and negaτive energy</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: b)τhe oτher one is basically filled wiτh powerful hope energy</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhaτ mighτ overload τhe τhing</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so you don't that any plain wands?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: if you only need any needle-type thing and not a specific one... I found out a while ago that chopsticks count as a tier-zero needleKind weapon. code "hjsy67f?", just two build grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I only have plain, non magical needles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: wait the hope wands might make it work better since I'm really hoping this works and doesn't explode\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: oh, it has to actually be wand-level? can't help you there then</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhaτ's τhe problem...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhese are mid-game/near end-game needles</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I have a time sword called the Dimension Slayer I'll take a risk\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'll give τhem τo you if you're so inτenτ on using τhem. Madokami help you if someτhing goes wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well I need some kind of wand or wand like thing to channel the rings energy\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: wait i have another idea\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I can make a magic gantlet to channel the energy\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok i have the gantlet made putting the rings on. first the lightening ring.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok that worked and not the hyper gravity ring.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS:  ok it balances out to about the same. now to set the gravity to 2 times what earth was.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and it works! hooray I am a genuis!\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: now for weapons trainning in heavier gravity\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I'll let you know how it goes later\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok the graity gantlet works\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *gravity\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: sorry I just woke up I trainned a little and then went to sleep. also tell past me not to take the rings off the gantlet\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it was a bad idea\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: wait what?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well later\l/</span><br />
