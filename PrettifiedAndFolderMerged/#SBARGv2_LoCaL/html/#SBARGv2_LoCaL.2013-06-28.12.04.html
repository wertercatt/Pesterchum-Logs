<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  everything goes sepia for a moment as he activates the Celestial Canvas and tries to fill in the cracks on one of the other cycles --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ((Rez, recoder is the nickname for the unnamed tool used by Beck and the other Mechanics in Uprising))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  looks at what hes doing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((thanks for the heads up))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Wait no fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...nothing happened. I guess Rejuvenation is an incompatible repair format or something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  the light cycle Kimura tried to fix derezes --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Now we only have 2</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( btw: <a href='http://okami.neoseeker.com/wiki/Category:Brush_Techniques'>http://okami.neoseeker.com/wiki/Category:Brush_Techniques</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's odd. normally when a brush technique fizzles, the thing just stays as-is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Normally your not trying to fix complex digital items</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Probly</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. bluh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You guys take 'em, I think I can manage with this thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you sure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  unplugs the recoder from the one he was working on --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: here Kimura</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: i fixed this one</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  fixes the other one now that he knows what he's doing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That thing... It's actually pretty handy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Recoders are really usefull</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Now I've got an idea just crazy enough to work...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I wonder if Ornis needs one of those... what with how much Sburb code is still broken...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ((I bookmarked that so that when Kimura tries things I know whats going on))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Kimura rember the game is called Sbarg</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: at least our version</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: right, like the troll version is Sgrub. sorry, just a habit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Is fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  mounts the light cycle --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  shrugs. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Semantics. Who needs 'em</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: What is a Semantic?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  hops on the other cycle --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like, details y'know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: And I dont think the recoder would work on the sorce code, unless he digitlized into the Session's grid</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hey, PK could you let me know the code for that thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ok... time to see if all that practice playing Tron 2.0's lightcycle mode pays off... wait, fuck, Legacy-class cycles are omnidirectional. oh well, should still be able to do it</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  scans it with his Watchtop --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  emails the code to Rez and Kimura, CodeFixr --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  :D --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  grins widely. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ((Because making funny refrences is what making your own Capca codes is for))</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  rides though the door --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  follows on his rollerblades --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  its just a long passage way with a gate way at the end --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: It would suck to have to walk down this</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  emerges out of the passage, and skids to a stop in a room --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  turns it back into a baton capchaloging it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  does the same --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  in the room is nothing but two large clear canister like things, containing Program armour and a big purpleish portal --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((fuck I'm lagging))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  one of them seems desigined for Kimura's sprite bodytype --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  knows what's going on and walks over to equip the armor --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  waits for Raz to arrive --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: So why did you selfprototype anyway Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it happened over a month ago, when Chronos revealed himself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: posing as the fake guardian, he had use send our sprites to power a battery thing so he could continue fixing the game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  arrives, running a hand through his hair. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but then it was a trap, things exploded, he was restored to full power and absconded</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Raz, go put on that armour</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Ammysprite was one of the sprites caught in the explosion, and made it back to my land with only 1 HP left...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  :\ --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I think shit is about to get real</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I think mine is dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  heads over and tests the armor for weight --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and then a sudden Exile Command told me that the only way to save her was to self-prototype, so that's what I did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  as expected its lightweight to him --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  shrugs and puts it on, satisfied. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I was goign to send Dinahsprite as soon as she finished up the Arkaiser with me but it took so long by the time we finished, shit had already gone down...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  the armor's Identity discs automaticly set to Raz and Kimura --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Mine went and i think died</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: since his hp appears to be at Negitave 58 accoriding to my Watchtop</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: negative HP is kind of a weird thing in this game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  the three walk into portal --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Well since all his other vitals are flatlined, im 99.9 percent sure he's dead</span><br />
