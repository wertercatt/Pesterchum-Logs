<span style="color:#484848">CAC: to my knowledge, the satalites aren't actually real</span><br />

<span style="color:#484848">CAC: It would seem that the puzzle started in my land</span><br />

<span style="color:#484848">CAC: we don't need them</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: we just need them to be linked</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Okay, the point of the puzzle is likely to cooperate</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if I could stop accidentally power-slashing things, I might be able to redraw some gates...</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hopefully I have enough Ink Grist left for them to be longer than just single-use</span><br />

<span style="color:#484848">CAC: and the person at the farthest edge would have mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: We need to alchemize each of these artifacts back to their owner's planets.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: after alchemization, I assume the first artifact will explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: Or disappear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: But the explosions are crucial</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: There is a caved in area on my planet, I assume that there will be a similar one on all involved's as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#484848">CAC: we have to blow up the thing impeding us from entry.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the what</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Yep!</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's a Type-Moon thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What the worse that can happen?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">CAV: Icarus flew high on his paper wings, he flew too high to the sun. Only to let them burn up in the atmosphere and to be sent spiraling down into the raging torrent below.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...other then being forced to crossdress.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Type-Moon works have a really interesting system of magic and magecraft. Technically what most people do falls into the later category, True Magic is a completely different class that few to none can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1: Said wings are metal, not paper or wax.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but that was because the chump was rubbing it in, and Chronos was still at the wheel.</span><br />

<span style="color:#39b873">CIJ: He says that the place is still intact, but a fair amount of carapaces are basically flipping the fuck out over Chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Technocraft you could call it, to mirror Magecraft.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: No, in the type moon universe, true magic is stuff that even MAGIC can't do. Like ressurecting the dead.</span><br />
