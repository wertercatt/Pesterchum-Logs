<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Well in other news I found some of my cosplay props! Sadly it looks like imps made off with the rest of itΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: bluh. finally back from that miniquest thingy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞welcome back?Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I wish future me had warned me about the stairs...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞The stairs are always out to get you man V:Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or more specifically, that despite being four-legged giving +12 against Stairs, it's still possible to roll a nat 1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞it at least means you'll get a 20 later down the lineΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, you subscribe to Darths &amp; Droids dice theory huh? :P</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey, last week the stairs got me a good one. then again, prostheticlegkind isn't exactly the best thing for balance.</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: What dice theory?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It is perfectly reasonable to assume that</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: in time, should you roll enough dies</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Nah, I just used to play DnDΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: at least one of those results will come up</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Its just part of dice karmaΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And though I do not pay full supplication to the Random Dice Gods</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞It really applies to all things. Once you suffer a loss you will suffer a win.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Superstition and luck seem to be actual, quantifiable measures in this metareality game</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: There is benefit towards supplicating them on occasion</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmm, that is true. as a Light Player, I actually *should* be putting more faith in the Heart of the Cards... or dice, as it were.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞I wonder if Karma applies here as well.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Perhaps</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Though I like to think of it better as...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Justice</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Have you found evidence, CP, for your Class as of yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Interesting that I'm a Mind player then :VΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not yet. Issun's taken to calling me the Wolf of Light, but as far as my ACTUAL class... idk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: probably not Bard or Prince, I don't destroy things through luck. also doubtful about Thief/Rogue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Hehe. Karma is a powerful force in paradox space. Great sacrifices shackle less than power.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I find as a Heart player, I am uniquely qualified to know exactly where I stand in the grand scheme of things</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞at least you aren't destroying yourself.Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞so good job!Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, while I was recovering from a stair-boggled thinkpan, anything interesting happen? I saw SV posted some land scans on Bubblr...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞TT's quirk was being wierd as usual V:Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, mostly her connection</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Some more people have posted error logs, it appears</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Nothing new of note through the Chumosphere, aside from the usual drivel</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Her connection ascended to the level of Eldritch Horror and played dark games with our souls :VΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: . . .</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞Such a harsh crowdΣ</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yikes. kinda glad I missed that, I don't want to go grimbark. especially now that the term is canon!</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Unless Hussie is alive and well and posting updates that none of us can access, I say that an alternative universe's rendition of Homestuck does not count as canon</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: one thing I should try next time: as soon as I trip, I should flip onto my back and ride the reflector like a makeshift sled, like that one episode of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</span><br />
