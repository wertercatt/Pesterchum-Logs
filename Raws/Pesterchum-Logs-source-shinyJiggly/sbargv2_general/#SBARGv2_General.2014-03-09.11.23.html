Alright then KitKat<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so on another note</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: overseer updated so the admin of a session can build the chain.</span><br />
FL the fuck is going on in v2<br />
Since you're a central player this time<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: FL burnt down a forest that was draining the life of people and the planet itself.</span><br />
I meant coming back ALIVE<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And managed to hit a glitch in the clock revival sequence, causing it to be unable to stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So if someone were to do the lucky thing on it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, one of three options could be pulled off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which there was a vote for yesterday.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: an IC vote, might I add ➜</span><br />
so what was rover talking about 2002 on the train<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would say the selections that were chosen in an IC vote mirror the choices that would be in an OOC vote almost exactly.</span><br />
was that a reference to another AC game<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, the first one DS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For the gamecube.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how do you know that for certain, FL? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which thing, the vote thing or the animal crossing thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the vote thing ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if one really thinks about it, the choices that would happen in an IC vote and an OOC vote both regard character death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would suppose another vote would be possible, but it would likely place blame on Kimura IC if things were to go wrong. And since FL is my character, I'm going to say that one vote was likely enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless you wanna argue with me about that.</span><br />
how does i earn bells<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sell fruit</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sell things to re-tail ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shake trees with fruit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and shake trees without fruit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: sometimes items and bells fall out.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I promise you won't die.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, there's shells on the beach ➜</span><br />
k<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well unless you step on a scorpion or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but that causes a respawn at the house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: scorpions only show up in the summer, right? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats the closest thing to death in this game</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (don't worry it will wear off after you go to sleep.)</span><br />
whats the difference between coins and bells<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: coins are bells</span><br />
ok<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: just smaller amounts of the currency</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is roughly equal to the japanese yen</span><br />
my pokets are full already....<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like we know 1 mercury grist is equal to a single dollar in homestuck due to the value of a painting</span><br />
so how many coins= 1 bell<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay, drag the coins into that area with the 5 digit number</span><br />
thank<br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and drag fruit on eachother</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if they are the same fruit</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also you don't need to fuck with the able sisters when it comes to basic tile designs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so if you wanna texture your town, you can do it for free.</span><br />
cool<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though they've really upgraded what can be done with pro design. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you want clothes that have different designs for the front, back, and shoulders, that costs bells</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I get that god tiers are kind of OP too, but the barriers that can be summoned immediately, and mute people at will just because of their opinions on things</span><br />
