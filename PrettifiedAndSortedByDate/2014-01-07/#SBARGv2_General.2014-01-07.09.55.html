<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And there we go.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wouldn't have found that if I never spelled bums backwards</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so thank AC for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: spell icup</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, that is one of the oldest jokes I ever heard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: thats why I made it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: also, fuck stereotypes</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and fuck people who think i'm gangsta and like rap and pumping pussy</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ??? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so AC is not!Meenah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: good to know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: some guy came up to me today</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and decided that all black people are gangsta</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and so he's like, "honey, lets move away"</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: as if i'm going to like... drive by shoot their asses</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: so seriously, fuck em'</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#cc0000">[CAC]</span>  is tempted to do crashman.exe --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I hope none of you would immediately assume that some black kid was ghetto just because why the fuck wouldn't he be</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, what is the status of Navi Chips?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I think they'll probably be a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, how would they function?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: as long as the navi in question is okay with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its a summoning chip.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I assume they'd create some kind of fake version of the character tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...That kinda mak- That makes even more sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: still though, you wouldn't want people using your character like that even if it weren't the actual one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: especially since the navi that the chip belongs to can create a second copy of themselves in the games</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: *that the chip is</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: probably what'll happen is that they'll leave the chip after a fight if the OOC wants to</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Style Change would obviously be limited to Navi's with Chng,BAT installed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I was thinking we might invent some new features, tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: something like style change and soul cross definitly</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Style Change would be avaliable to everyone, but other than Cross Fusion, soul cross wouldn't really... work, for anyone other than megaman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we're going to make up something like it probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and then make it a downloadable program or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: might even have some plot potential if we do it right</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, expanding Style Change with Navi Styles would work out, but it would require a navi chip to activate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: that might be cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For Balance reasons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, when is this taking place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT avidCurator <span style="color:#cc0000">[CAC]</span>  wants something reminescent of beast out because beast out was fucking amazing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: not sure yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: probably after we get enough people in on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I also have an interesting concept to help things out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: wait the rest of these people probably don't give a shit about our conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And will basically make it reasonable that multiple people would do this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: lemme open dis ting</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC:  <a href='#megaman_bn_RP'>#megaman_bn_RP</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: anyone else interested in this can come along as well, btw</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: bluh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I kinda lost interest after you said no plot elements would be included.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sorry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: well I mean, obviously some of the stuff would</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I just mean the organizations, tbh'</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which play a massive role in the battle network series.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: maybe sometime after megaman bn6 but before star force, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (well except for gospel)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I dunno, I just don't want them to have an extreme influence is all</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If it took place after BN6, we would have too many copy bots running around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: so we can do some more original stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not make an OOC rule about not having copy bots?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, obviously the main goals could be similar... but the way all of them go about doing it could be /massively different/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Its a matter of not wanting it to be at the beggining of the series or before it </span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: because the technology is kind of more fun in the later games</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, most of the tech exists before hand.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, what Tech are you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but it gets more advanced over the course of the games</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: doesn't the PET go through a shit ton of upgrades from the first game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We could start out with the more advanced PETs... and upgrade it further.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wifi PETs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, it does.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, those can be done earlier in this branched timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and then also, I feel like maybe having some more original antagonist organizations might be a bit more fun</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The problem with basing it after EXE6 is Wily reforming.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Why is that a problem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Wily was behind of /all/ of the organizations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not have organizations that aren't based around him</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because well... big bads, man. You can't live without them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: then why not have a different big bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: we could probably do it after the main cast is dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: i'm not totally familiar with the timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except Wily is basically Immoratl.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Immortal*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but I think its a few hundred years before starfor-</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: wait what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0000aa">CURRENT Noodles [CNN]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: Leaf, Link or Legal System?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Survived islands sinking, massive pointblank explosions, being absorbed into alpha...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: isn't it explained how he survived those</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: and also, didn</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: didn't Wily reform in the first megamans then turn out to be fucking with everyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I mean, i'm not sure we want to use him</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but I think that if the original game's Wily would do that</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: the BN games' wily might do that too</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, thats an irk that I have with the original megaman games that isn't realistic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /they fucking believed him/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like how they /let regal back in at the end of 5/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dude, he had hidden himself then took over in 4.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If noone thinks it is and act and doing it again, I have no faith in logic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is an act*</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: well i'm sure he dies eventually</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: or else he'd still be there for starforce</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: or you'd atleast here about him </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Who says he isn't?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: He might be playing a role like Model W.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, we never got past 3 games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you ever played Zero and ZX?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: Model W is important throughout both games</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Model W is the last traces of Dr. Weil.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Combined with Ragnarok.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: how would that work for Wily then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The answer lies in the third game, and basic computer logic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the third game, Wily was able to upload into a computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And tell me, what do you usually do to game files before making changes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: save?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, for when you are modding it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What does one normally do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: I don't know? I don't mod shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /they make backups/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So basically I just managed to combine the Sigma Virus and Model W for... potentially something that takes place after the 3 starforce games.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#72a0c1">CURRENT imagineBreaker [CIB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Model W = Weil</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: AC, why don't you just do a Post Starforce RP?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: Wiley made a back up of himself before becoming a good guy, that gets released?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: is that the idea?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: because I don't know what that would even be about</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: if its after starforce whats even happening?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SS, thats how Wily managed to survive dying all those times, along with a robot body likely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: are they still doing wave tech or whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: or what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doesn't need to be too far after.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: i'd need to talk to AE about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which one</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: since they were kind of the reason I even decided to do it</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You are going to need it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: i'm all for a starforce thing tbh</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: but I dunno :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, make sure to keep backups of the tumblr sourcecode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cc0000">CAC: why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, you don't want a repeat, right?</span><br />

This kanji:  魔  According to Google translalte, it means evil spirit, or similar such thing.  however, when i put it with 獣 in an attempt to get something like "demon beast", and translate it back, it translates as "magical beast".
