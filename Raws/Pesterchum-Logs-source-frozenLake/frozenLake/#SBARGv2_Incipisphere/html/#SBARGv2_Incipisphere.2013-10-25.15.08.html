[03:52:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, aside from the ones that I'm the butt of, but those are mostly insults.</span><br />
[03:53:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably different category.</span><br />
[03:53:26] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah those are palsy-insults I have like 8 categories of insults</span><br />

[03:54:30] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's play this game, then. Why would you want to do something like that?</span><br />
[03:54:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because its something that I feel that I am /decent/ at.</span><br />
[03:55:44] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So... because you want to?</span><br />
[03:56:25] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hm.</span><br />
[03:57:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I want to go down as someone who /actually/ knew how to calculate codes for punch card alchemy instead of getting a gravestone with "Idot" written on it.</span><br />
[03:57:35] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Honestly I don't think there's all that much to be explored as far as alchemy is concerned, beyond seeing what something might make with another thing, or some shit like that.</span><br />
[03:58:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Recipe Modus states that the Hard-Boiled Fedora is a Potted Plant &amp;&amp; Dream Bubbles || Matriorb.</span><br />
[03:58:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So far, I have the Hard-Boiled Fedora and Potted Plant codes.</span><br />
[03:59:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: cz!Z!l!k and CuPA8LnQ respectively.</span><br />
[03:59:26] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So you're saying you're trying to figure out how to get the codes for the other two things.</span><br />
[03:59:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, exactly.</span><br />
[04:00:04] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: And what exactly do you have to benefit from this, other than being known as the guy that messed around with alchemy a lot?</span><br />
[04:00:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not a perfect process, But I can narrow it down to say, 2^18 items so far for what /might/ be the code for Dream Bubbles.</span><br />
[04:00:50] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: That doesn't answer my question.</span><br />
[04:01:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I can get the code for the Matriorb, I could potentially get the code for other items that may be more importaint to us.</span><br />
[04:01:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like?</span><br />
[04:02:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't know.</span><br />

[04:02:25] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Tch.</span><br />
[04:02:57] <span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: See, this would be more credible if you actually had something that everyone could agree would be a good idea to figure out how to get without having obtained the code in the first place.</span><br />
[04:03:04] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You had such a good streak of being semi-cool, too. Like last night was actually pretty great.</span><br />

[04:03:53] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And now you're dedicating yourself to a process whose fruits you don't even /know/ for the sake of, doing something worthwhile?</span><br />
[04:03:59] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let me save your time. It's not this.</span><br />
[04:04:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but eventually, you might see something in the Recipe modus that you might want</span><br />
[04:05:03] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Reverse engineering canon item codes when we've got a perfectly good trove of unplumbed things here? Seriously?</span><br />

[07:59:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What is normal at this point?</span><br />
[08:01:16] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: You're asking me what normal is at this point</span><br />
[08:01:29] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Do you want a real answer or "we're all super weird lolololo x3"</span><br />
[08:01:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, after all, I am not.</span><br />
[08:02:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would like the real answer in your opinion.</span><br />
[08:02:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, none of us are omniscient.</span><br />
[08:02:36] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No but I have a bloody sociology textbook sitting right here.</span><br />
[08:03:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright here we go lemme bust out what the definition of "normal" is so you can at least say you know ONE thing</span><br />
[08:03:54] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Normal is the behavior that is consistent with the various values, morals, and norms of a culture</span><br />
[08:04:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...we have a culture?</span><br />
[08:04:28] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we came from a culture ➜</span><br />
[08:06:25] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So, for example, culture I used to live in had a hardcore emphasis on common sense/responsibility/not being a scrub</span><br />
[08:07:20] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: So when I see things like "Wweh I'm sad and won't do anything/I'm the cancer of the session and still won't do anything"</span><br />
[08:07:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's some deviant fucking behavior, and is most heinous</span><br />
[08:08:19] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: But see it's totally cool if your only definition of a culture/sanction is circle-jerking yourself</span><br />
[08:09:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not really when one cares about what other people thing about them more than what they think of themselves.</span><br />
[08:09:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wow, if you look up now you MIGHT catch the point going over your head at Mach 7.</span><br />
[08:10:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The point is I need to stop being negative, right?</span><br />
[08:10:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or is the point that I shouldn't give a fuck at all?</span><br />
[08:10:27] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: The point is you need to stop being a little bitch</span><br />
[08:10:30] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: That's the point</span><br />
[08:10:46] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: It's hard when you've been raised in a culture where bitchitude of such magnitude is accepted</span><br />
[08:10:58] <span style="color:#d3661d">CPO: Heh.</span><br />
[08:11:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well of course.</span><br />
