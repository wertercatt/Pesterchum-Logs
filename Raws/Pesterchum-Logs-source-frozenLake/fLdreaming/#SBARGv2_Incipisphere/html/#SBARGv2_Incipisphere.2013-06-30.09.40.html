<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well see I don't remember that one and that seems pretty redundant</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What else is a race for if not to see who's fastest like shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: you have a 300 IQ you shouldn't be such a chump Eggy</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: It was in the second cutscene in the Hero Story.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Wait, does FlightlessIcarus have an IQ of 300?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: i severely hope not</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: there's a very faint chance he's some kind of idiot savant</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: very faint, but there</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Well, we gotta account for the fact that Eggman's IQ is self proclamed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Or the doctor put the IQ and weight in the wrong boxes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But he built at least /two/ full fleets of high-tech battleships</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: True.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: You can have a huge IQ, but if you don't have common sense...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Plus you gotta remember that he SINGLE HANDEDLY built a death star rip off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: When he's not getting worfed by ancient evils he tries to abuse for fun and profit he manages jsut fine up til the inevitable betrayal</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Time Eater.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Guy's smart.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Even if I is kind of a doof</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah Time Eater too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Repurposing an eldritch space time thingy into a pilottable robot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: all in a days work</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Time Eater, the ONE ENTITY LOYAL to Eggman.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: even though that final boss battle was /junk/</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: FINAL COLOR BLASTER.</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Chronicals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I know I spelt that wrong,</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: close</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Chronicles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But, maybe. If you're bringing games that aren't main-series into it, /maybe/</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Also, Solaris... at least for silver.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: And we go right back to Sonic 06.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sonic 06 is practically the Godwins Law of the Sonic series</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: if you have to go to it to make your point</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: you lose the arguement</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Alright, ignoring 06/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The Time Eater just</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Wasn't a good final boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOMING SHOT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Which sucked after the choice quality that was p much the rest of Generations</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I KNOW WHAT A HOMING SHOT LOOKS LIKE YOU DAFT FUCKS</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: AND ITS LIKE THE /ONLY/ ATTACK HE DOES</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ASIDE FROM HIS ARM TELEPORT THING</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: And throwing the Sun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Come to think of it, isn't it... strange that Crisis City Came back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: As that would mean that the Time Eater can reach into other timelines.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Or... a certain event got deleted.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: If one stops the flame from being blown out, than wouldn't it happen again- OH GOD I'M TAKING 06 SERIOUSLY.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm still shipping you with that game</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Yeah, my waking self is like the one person in this session who has actually beaten it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Does Rivals count as part of the main series?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Ifrit final boss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Depends on what you count. I figured main were console titles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: But then that rules out half of Colors and Generations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: The DS/3DS half.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: And you know what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: SONIC GENESIS. the gba port of the orignal sonic 1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: i was wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: With the slow down and fucked up physics, it counts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Sonic Genesis is actually godwin's law</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Actually, I would say both of the Aniversary games in 2006 count.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Maybe I should be a troll and say Blue Spheres.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Naw.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /Not/ do this</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Now lets pick the BEST final boss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: ...Still colors</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Or Sonic Adventure 2</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Since you can pull whatever you want from side games and spinoffs I'm gonna be a hipster about this and  go for an unpopular opinion</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Secret Rings</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe not /the/ best there're a lot up there but one /of/ the best.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Swinging and swerving between that misshapen bastard's attacks charging up to close in and /beat the everloving shit out of him with your bare hands/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /Hell/ yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Alright then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: BLACK KNIGHT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Adventure two was really kickass too. The 3D controls were surprisingly not ass, Live and Learn in the background, the backdrop of space and switching between Shadow and Sonic were all awesome.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Adventure two was really kickass too. The 3D controls were surprisingly not ass, Live and Learn in the background, the backdrop of space and switching between Shadow and Sonic were all awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I got that</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And, Black Knight, you say. Alright, why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: No, not really</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ah</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Lets see... managing to deflect blows from a creature MUCH bigger than yourself, then finally charging into it, slicing a huge hole in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah p good shit, true.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And replace beating the shit out of with slashing a million times and my last comments fit too</span><br />

<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I was just listening to it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: But you gotta account for the fact Sonic is basicly gonna end the world.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Yet, even an end is better than a hellhole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Black Knight's story... Or maybe its writing, was really lacking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like, Sonic gets on Merlina's case less for /using the powers of hell to prolong the world/ and more that she's trying to prolong it at all</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: it was just</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: blegh</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Well, imagine you were living forever, and NOTHING CHANGED.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: thats basically the world that would be created.</span><br />
