[05:18:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  The cavern is pitch black inside, and perfectly silent. It's like it just sucks up all noise beyond a low warbling sound, as if you hit the last key of a piano and held it. A deep growling can be heard as the entire party enters the cavern, tufts of fire and smoke coming out from farther in the cave. --</span><br />
[05:18:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />

[05:21:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  Massive steps creep closer, fire spewing out from the corners of a large and drooling mouth, suspended 30 feet in the air with a soft glow. The Fuck-o-saurus has stepped out from around the side of the cavern, the only sound besides it the drip of water. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhnZkNj7kAo'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhnZkNj7kAo</a> --</span><br />

[05:26:13] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT dungeonWhatever <span style="color:#000000">[CDW]</span>  The firebursts shoot up into the top of the cavern, illuminating the Fuck-o-saurus. It turns out it isn't a saurus at all, it's a giant 3 headed hell hound, equal parts scorched flesh and bone, 3 heads dripping fire and drool simultaneously, leaning forward to give out a triple speared ROAR of intimidation to the party.
