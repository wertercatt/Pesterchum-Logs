<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  starts tinkering on an object identical to the one she had created before after her ship crashed last time --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  pokes her head into the Hangar, looking about. Alright, where to start the lecture-nag... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  is in the corner of the hangar where a bunch of her stuff was deployed --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  stays out of the way of the construction --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks over at Fluffy, not to nag but to make sure she didn't break a leg again or something --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  hums to herself as she works --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  also looks over at fluffy. Words, why do you fail her now? When she would normally have many things to say about escaping from a clinic? Why now? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  walks on over. Well, if anything: She can ask about the situation of work, if not nagging about hospital-houdining. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor's <span style="color:#555555">[CFI'S]</span>  ear twitches and she turns around slightly. "Oh hey." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  waves to FF, then turning back to fluffy. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm fine... it's Fluffy that escaped from the clinic while still recovering...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So. How healed-up are you, currently?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Uh... Well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  rubs her side. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Okay. Anything besides that? Or are you feeling 100% fine?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: That ward is depressing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I didn't need that kind of atmosphere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I like being here at work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, hospitals tend to be several kinds of boring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay. Fair enough. That's not the question, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I feel good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Good good good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Thank you. That's the answer I was hoping to hear.</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yes.\</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: My company uses nano healing technology.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It takes a while to kick in some times but it's good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Hmmm... useful.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, cool...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Well... good to see ya back on your feet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Indeed. I guess, considering that you are fine, we should leave you to your work... how is that coming, by the way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Great. The last one blew up so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Fair point, alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Do you know why it blew up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF, meteor strike.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: So that's why I'm building an improved one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: From scratch?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Seriously, a metor strike?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I was mining in an asteroid belt</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Company standard ships have hard shells.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: BUT!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I caught the meteor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I have it and the droids will mine it out soon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... good?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yessss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It's like sweet revenge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: But more rocky.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Lots of useful material?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Yes!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sweet :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Nice indeed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: In fact...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, I guess now we just wait. We should start talking about what it'll take to build that "firefly" model you showed us a couple days ago, but that's later- Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  moves over and drops the meteor off on the ground... it was about 26 feet in height and same way around. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Already in progress.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how you got that in here despite the ship crash, I'll never know... unless you use Wallet Modus or someth-- ooh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Nice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  whistles. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: I can actually turn my materials into data.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: It's part of the system I am using.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah sweet, thanks! I guess tomarrow is when others, myself included, start really putter it together?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Waaaait what? What sorta system is that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: So all that raw mineral that i got is being filtered to my droids.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I'll help if I can... have a bit of experince in engineering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm. so actually Filesystem Modus or something equivalent to it... cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: And they build the ship from the blue print i uploaded to them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Sounds kinda like FL's modus...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh! Noted!</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: What we will have is the framing and all that, but engines, guns and systems we will have to build.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Gotcha. We will get working on that tomarrow, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#555555">CFI: Eeyup.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  starts firing at the meteor. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  just stands back. Okay. Whatever makes her happy... --</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...Damn...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  just... lets fluffy take her stress out on that meteor and goes to explore teh Hangar a bit. If she's going to be in this place building for the ship, then she should get used to it! --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  the hangar is a huge steel building with various side rooms along the walls.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also looks around, this place is /nice/ --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  just explores the side rooms for a bit ((and tooootally does not start to read paranatural  oocly nope)) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  there is an obvious futuristic flare about the place. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  it must be like this where fluffy is from. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT fluffyInventor <span style="color:#555555">[CFI]</span>  sits down after obliterating the meteor. She dematerializes the chunks of ore from the meteor and gets rid of all the ice. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  yawns, heading out of the hangar. She will ask more about this place tomarrow. For now, rest seems like a good option. --</span><br />
