<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: You amuse me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: Hmm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: I was just using the alchemiter to upgrade my weaponary yet again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I've observed you in various alternate timelines, strangely enough.. you did not exist in mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: What is your purpose in this one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: ...I need to prevent the creation of chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: And to do that, I need to prevent any possibility of a universe being created.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: How are you certain of his creation in exactly "this" universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: ...the horror terrors told us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: You do know that he incarnates spacetime, he could be anywhere at anytime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: That we were to create the universe that he would have been born in. And thus, we needed to prevent his universe from being created.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I wish I could help you. This timeline version of you seems more susceptable to my questions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: If so, do you know of the very origin of the current scratch of the session. And why it is getting worse?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I have been pondering and pondering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Is this a doomsday clock?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: ...You assume the session is going to /explode/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: You are insane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Not exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: Your first guardian is the cause.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: By changing variables haphazardly, he is breaking small elements of the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I see. Then why are you still in this universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Are you not limited by his changes in the code?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: While he manages to change elements, those elements have a range.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: You might fear the horror terrors, but we were lead by them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: If so, is he blocking the horrorterrors in this session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: I believe so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Is that the element that is leading us to this creation of chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: In the last session, we had been told that the guardian had been "corrupted" by chronos.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: ...I believe this corruption is on going.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I see. Then why not collaborate with the inhabitants of this very timeline?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: And thus, he is trying to bring him back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Their feelings on the guardian are inheritantly the same.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: Then why continue to play?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: Do you not wish to stop the guardian?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: Why not fire themselves through the return gates?</span><br />
<span style="color:#e12d00">AV: I had hoped for a different response.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: Goodbye.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">FL: I must now convince my scratched self to aid me.</span><br />
