<span style="color:#887000">CSL: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: id expect it to be like the one thing that costs artifact but ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: uranium grist is like the cost for nearly all exotic matter and radioactive stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Stuff that actually costs artifact is like the big rigs truck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...can you make the big rigs truck</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I did, once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because that would actually be insanely useful</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It made it out of the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you can pass through shit and go up walls a-</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: do you still have the code</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i might actually want to use it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Captcharoid it yourself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe combine it with the lunar whale and see what happens</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, didn't the meteor wind up going backwards in time due to the acceleration or something? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: was the truck going in reverse</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No that was the truck going through the furthest ring.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I vaguely remember some sort of time shenanigans ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was going faster than light still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and not going backwards through time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so do you think the truck is going to show up in someone elses session now</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, somehow it was breaking the light speed limit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It did</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: really</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It came back into ours.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: amazing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And crashed into the meteor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: LIKE I JUST TOLD YOU</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i need to make one of these</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: no one man should have all that power</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I told you, use a captcharoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but is it worth it</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: does this thing have the potential to destroy everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. I remember that stupid truck now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, it ignores the speed of light...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Doesn't have infinite energy though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: could i doom the session by making this truck and combining it with my ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think it got to a max speed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I would not try it, if I were you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe thats what creates the blue hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: everyone making big rigs trucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ill make a copy and keep my original ship</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but yeah, I think that thing follows γmc instead of γmc^2</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or something like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where it just keeps going faster instead of taking progressively more energy to get closer to lightspeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: almost got it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THERE</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Takes a ton of time to fill it up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe I might be able to do captcha bricks ( 11111110 ) to fill it up in groups of 8.</span><br />
