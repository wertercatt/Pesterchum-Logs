[06:28:40] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Hmmmm Σ</span><br />

[06:30:24] <span style="color:#fe7b20">CPO: Woot</span><br />
[06:31:34] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ As a Knight of Hope you tend to "weaponize" your Hope towards achieving your goals. You seem to have a boundless enthusiasm but you don't seem to lend Hope to others. Often your actions leave othe rplayers irked but they are always done with the best intentions in mind.  Σ</span><br />
[06:32:02] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Basically you provide Hope for yourself and use it to move forward but can't do the same for others. Σ</span><br />

[06:33:51] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Ah but it is. Advice is not the same as Hope though they can be linked if you do so with the intent to provide more options or good feelings. Σ</span><br />

[06:36:22] <span style="color:#008282">CCA: ∞ Furthermore when you do advise other you tend to provide yourself with Hope first before you act and help them. Just because you sometimes give good advice doesn't mean you can give Hope to others all the time.
