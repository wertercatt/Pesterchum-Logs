[05:49:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, its depressing everywhere I do a google image search.</span><br />
[05:50:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its like its the go to image for sadness and depression.</span><br />
[05:52:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Niki, look for a note to yourself, read it out to me, and then copy whats on it and send it back. I'm worried about AS, so I figure I'm going to use time travel to get a message from paradox space itself on what to do. Is that alright?</span><br />
[05:52:43] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then? ➜</span><br />
[05:53:08] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm looking around my house... ➜</span><br />
[05:53:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The only way a doomed timeline would be created from that is if the message on the note changes, which it won't.</span><br />

[05:54:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Um, no idea.</span><br />
[05:54:36] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's not in the fridge ➜</span><br />

[05:55:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If so, look under them.</span><br />
[05:55:17] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's a ladder to the attic, but no stairs. ➜</span><br />
[05:55:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Look on the bottom of the steps of the ladder?</span><br />
[05:55:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or something?</span><br />
[05:56:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, it's one of those pull-down ladder things ➜</span><br />

[05:57:56] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: where does he even find most of these wrappers anyways? ➜</span><br />
[05:58:24] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat</span><br />
[05:58:50] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: last time I checked he alchemized a legendary infinate juice bag, so there probably wouldn't be a reason for new capri sun wrappers to show up. ➜</span><br />
[05:59:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hey, just because he has an infinite amount of one flavor doesn't mean he has infinite amounts of the others.</span><br />
[05:59:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess you have a point there. ➜</span><br />
[06:01:40] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, checking under the rug... ➜</span><br />
[06:01:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...man, it's clean under here. ➜</span><br />

[06:08:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess that means do nothing.</span><br />
[06:08:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: guess so</span><br />
[06:10:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you know what? I've had enough of "doing nothing". The last couple times it screwed things over. ➜</span><br />
[06:11:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And doing something is likely gonna screw things over for me.</span><br />
[06:14:45] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it doesn't have to be anything rash, the key with these sorts of situations is to choose your words with care and be on the level. This is a friend we're working with, not a rocket. ➜</span><br />
