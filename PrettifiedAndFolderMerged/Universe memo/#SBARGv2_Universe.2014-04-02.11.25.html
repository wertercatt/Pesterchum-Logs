<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Greetings...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi BB ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you doing alright lately? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Yeah sort of...caught a bit of a cold for a few days, but I'm feeling better...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...how about you?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm alright. Been hanging around on the Quinn Prime for the past couple days, getting kinda bored. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Quinn Prime?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: a spaceship that we got fom Dr. Fluffy ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *from ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's pretty cool, but there's almost never a qualifyed captain on board. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...So has there been any...developments?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not really. NV was supposed to help guide us to some place to find some kinda ash staff before that one chick gets it, but he hasn't really said when we're gonna take off towards that place yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, considering we plan on using my time powers to go back a week or two so there aren't any traps there, it could wind up happening whenever. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...we're doing wat with your time powers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, if the rumors I've heard are true, that just might end up being moot...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what kinda rumors? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...That this person can...change Aspects?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, but not on command.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, but do you really think they'd have it mapped out completely so there's always traps? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: at very least we'll be able to catch them off-guard ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: basically, if she touches a piece of cloth depicting an Aspect (canon or made-up), she absorbs it, her outfit changes to it, and she gains the powers of it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but only one aspect at a time</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...that is rather...unsettling...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...It also makes my plan a little bit more complicated...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, she has like, 5 crazy-powerful goons on her side too. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...So I've heard...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this is gonna be one heck of a tough thing, if the remaining amount of us can even stand up to them. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I have ideas...it's just a matter if I can implement them...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeeah, that's usually the kicker. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I should work on that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright then. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'll try to keep myself informed of going-ons and such...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm going to head off then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, stay safe out there. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...same to you...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...good night...</span><br />
