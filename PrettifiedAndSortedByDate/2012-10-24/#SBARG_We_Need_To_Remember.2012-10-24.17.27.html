<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: No filter? </span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The log of that convo with the guy that claimed he was me.</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">PCA: 「How entertaining.」</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I have an idea, it seems to help people who are still lost to see familiar words, perhaps we could all say our titles and maybe the names of our lands, it could help trigger a memory for FL</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I actually chose that name because of that reason.</span><br />

<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#540b95">CBN: that i am</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I had no title, nor did I have a land. The lands and titles of my creators would reveal their identity, so I am afraid that is also out of the question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: plus, I just love music in general.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: How did you know it was me? Aside from the comment about doomed selves?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: Why can you not name them, OR?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I for one was a Maid of Time with the Land of Walls and Frost</span><br />

<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Yes, it was.</span><br />
<span style="color:#540b95">CBN: i didn't. thanks for telling me though sometimes the best way to get information is to pretend you already know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: Because, it is their job to remember, in time. Memory is a very precious thing. I cannot risk allowing that information out of my server at this time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: hehe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#771cff">CTT: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">PCA: 「Oh it seems I have another guest. Things may become a bit dicy for me soon so you will have to forgive me if I sign off temporarily. 」</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: interesting :-:</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: They recorded their journeys, but I have locked their recordings. Memory is the key.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I remember being somewhere warm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is odd, since I live in minnesota.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTA: I am a Lord of Mind - The Land of Rivers and Rubble. It's a lovely place, really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: warm is good, it was probably your Land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I hated mine, to be honest</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Ironic, TA.</span><br />
<span style="color:#771cff">CTT: I'm..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: What about Dante?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...lord?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: I'm the Muse of Void. I hailed from the land of Treasures and Death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I hear his title was different</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: ((Sbarg generator gave me Lord of Mind))</span><br />
<span style="color:#771cff">CTT: I'm a Lord of Rage...and I think the place I got was the Land of Ink and Bone..?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTA: Dante? He was a Thief of Doom. His land was the Land of Wind and Canyons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: that sounds nice, do you ever miss it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I can reveal this, however; One who had a very strong hand in my creation is currently very frustrated at my lack of assistance in his journey to remember. He has, however, recalled his Title and Land. The Heir of Blood, in the Land of Wind and Gardens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: TA i thought you said Crayons... lol </span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like, the title Lord of Blood is importaint...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: It was probably your title!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know I spelt that wrong.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, lets see...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: heh taint is something that can happen to blood that's been tampered with, it's perfectly alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTA: No, I don't miss any of it. I used Dante's title to save my life and my brothers and sisters. I gave up his life for my own. You can't miss what was never yours.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: You said yourself Dante may not be entirely gone</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I am willing, however, to bring DH back, if you wish to speak to him. I cannot guarantee his mental state, however.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: What happened to DH?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: Not if being here would be detrimental </span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: only if you think it would help, which is the purpose of this memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTA: I will find what is left of him, if anything, and kill it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55007f">COR: He is resting. Nothing has happened to him, I simply made him sleep.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, my title is apparently the Lord of Blood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTA: I am of the Void. The Furthest Ring, as you know it. I was borne there and I embody aspects of it. I cast a shadow of nothingness and my eyes reflect the same nothingness. The nothingness of the Void.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: Even if that's true, remembering would help you understand how to deal with him</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I would focus my energy on remembering so he couldn't do things like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: Actually, remembering would not help him "deal with me."</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It sounds like hes lying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: knowing who and what you are would enable him to understand how to react to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: that kind of dealing, OR</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: FL, you remember your god tier title, do you remember ascending? it can be a very painful but powerful memory</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So basically pointless.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I have a short poem I composed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Would anyone like to hear it?</span><br />

<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Ok.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: OR, taking direct control of someone is not a very effective way to actually get anyone to do....anything really</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I'm saying a poem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: That I wrote myself?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: Not direct control, simply suggestions. With the threat of direct control. Very effective.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might be something that you remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or some crap like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: it's something.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: heh looks like FL is coming around</span><br />
<span style="color:#771cff">CTT: ..hmm..</span><br />

<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I wrote it myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It sounds interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I think it's mostly about my mental state.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: And the last part...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: I hope it just doesn't happen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: I actually can't technically argue that, OR, but it's not an effective way to earn trust</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: did you write it before, in the last session, or since then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6b4263">CMP: Just now actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I don't need his trust. Only his compliance. He needs to remember. Before the Scratch, he would have understood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: well, if the rumors that we need to re enter the Medium are true...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: but not trusting you is going to make him resistant to the memories</span><br />

<span style="color:#1c488d">CAS: Might I intervine to ask what exactly we are doing here? A simple question but neve rhurts to be sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1 = 3 always...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: He already doesn't trust me, because I will not share the memories with him. He wants to remember, that much is certain; I simply want him to do it without me giving him a memory directly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or is it the other way around?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">PCA: 「I have returned. Pardon my sudden absence but the matter that caused it has been...taken care of.」</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: Simply pushing him in the right direction.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: god, I don't know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: He will not answer unless directly spoken to. The rest of this chat is being obscured from him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: what we're doing, AS is trying to help each other remember</span><br />

<span style="color:#1c488d">CAS: Also thank you DA for taking the time to answer my question.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTA: To have fun.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ea4760">CDA: of course, AS, I made this memo to help people</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">PCA: 「Thank you DC. I am here for similar reasons as the majority.」</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: I do not wish for him to be triggered by anything that is said.</span><br />

<span style="color:#4b093b">CDC: You're very welcome ouo</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">COR: The very state that helped bring about my existence.</span><br />
