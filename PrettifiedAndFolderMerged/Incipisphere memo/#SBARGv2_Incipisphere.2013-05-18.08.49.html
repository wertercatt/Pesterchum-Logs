<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, imagine the hotel, and then pretend it's actually fancy and actually follows more laws of physics and has more floors.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so nothing like the hotel at all?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we try to keep the shenanigans down to a minimum</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so again nothing like the hotel\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: we would be dead if iτ were acτually τhe hoτel</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well that's not good. or maybe it is I don't know\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: sorry something happened and i was reacting to it not your comment tt\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I just desorted the table and part of the floor\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *destroyed\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Θ-o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: CS, are you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  o_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: uh yes i'm just fine. just I think i figured our what the cane sword and knife do,\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: unless I'm completely wrong\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: just let  set this things on something else to test\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: putting  them on glass\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: and the glass wasn't destroyed\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: which is good I think\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well it's not bad at least\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS:  ok now for the test.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS:  and i have one less butter knife\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well at least the test clears things up. partly about what the cane sword and knife do and how I could have gotten through that door\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I think I'm calmed down enough</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I think I know how i got through that door\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the one that me and fs couldn't get through when we were exploring\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  yesyesyes I know that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  especially about somehow being referred to in the third person for some strange reason</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I'm meaning...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  how? o.O</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well first off fs i'm going to give you a code. if i'm right this blade though it's the same type I made should have a different power than mine.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: even though it's the same blade the baten kaitos element in it is verible\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS:  ok the code is B4t3nB1a \l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Fs were you able to make a blade from the code i gave you?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  uh yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and I'm seeing it, but</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  what exactly am I looking at here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it should be a baten kaitos elemental sword. what it does depends on what ever element it was given. why what's happening over there with your sword?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  it's kinda well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ominous looking</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: fbgv</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: gfhng m</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and I don't mean just aesthetically</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: TT, are you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  o_o</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  TT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: wh-wha</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: god damniτ i dozed off again</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, pwhew</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ominous how? I don't know what your blade would come out as. also TT are you alright?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: thought you were spouting eldrich chants or something for a sec there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I'm jusτ preττy τired</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: and whaτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so you are alright TT.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: pretty sure she's okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so fs what do you mean by ominous?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's got this... aura going on about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  what did you say this was from?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: baten kaitos. eturnal wings and the lost ocean.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  sure it wasn't pokemon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  cuz I swear</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  this thing looks pretty gastly or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: eternal\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  but no seriously I dunno about this</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: wait a minute I have to check something. whatever you do do noit pick up that blade untill I can check the magnus list for baten kaitos eternal wings and the lost ocean. you might have gotten the wicked jester blade\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok never mind in eternal wings and the lost ocean they didn't have the wicked jester blade\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  o_0</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: if they had i would have suggested destroying it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: seriously you would not want the wicked jester\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I'd think so</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it's a powerful sword but once it's used up it kills it's owner\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  @ _ @</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: of course mixed with adamithrium the sword would never break or wear down but it's better not to tempt fate\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: whaτ τhe fuuuuuuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: but since the wicked jester isn't in eternal wings there is no chance of anyone getting it \l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well at least unless someone else make swords using origins\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *makes\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so fs how is your blade looking? can you discribe it?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's strange</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: strange how?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  the blade looks all wierd</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  like it's all murky</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and it looks like there are some wierd parts where it just splits off</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and at the ends? it just looks kinda hooked</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  all crude-like</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: that is very different then my blade. can you send a picture of in in a magnus?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dude I haven't even played this game</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS:  alright well make a guess of what element you think it is and i'll find it.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  element?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  how do those work in this game anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well there are six elements: Water, Fire, Light, Dark, Wind and Chrono\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  DARK</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  DARKDARKDARKDARK</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  there is no question that is totally what this thing is</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: water and fire cancell each other out, same with light/dark and wind/chrono\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  like seriously</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: alright so dark not just to look up dark swords\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  I get the feeling this thing might curse me if i grab the handle</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: fs is this your blade? <a href='http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121120043420/batenkaitos/images/4/4e/Shadow_Thruster.png'>http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121120043420/batenkaitos/images/4/4e/Shadow_Thruster.png</a> \l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  o_o</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  is that what it's called?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  shadow THRUSTER?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yeah\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  how does anybody thrust with this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: so that is your blade?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, that thing looks like it was puked up after a bad hangover</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  yeah it is</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: iτ looks like a diseased τwig.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: no the upside I don't think this blade can actually curse you. in baten kaitos eternal wings weeapons didn't harm the people who weilded them unless they were bomb magnus\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *weapons\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: the bomb had a 90% chance of knocking out your own character\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: or at least with my luck it did.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: sorry i'm getting off track. fs what is your aspect?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  hrm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's void</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  well, why do you ask?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  's what I meant</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: that could explain how you got a dark weapon on the other hand I got a time weapon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: this is what I got <a href='http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121120044107/batenkaitos/images/1/13/Dimension_Blade.png'>http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121120044107/batenkaitos/images/1/13/Dimension_Blade.png</a> \l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: The dimension Blade\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  now THAT looks like it could stab some chumps</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: not really sure why it's called that if it's a time weapon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well with the weighted cruve it's more of a slashing weapon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *curve\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  still isn't all hook like</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: but yes it can stab I guess but that's how I got through the door.\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: at least I think\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS:  I think i might have aged it to rust\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  dunno about that, man</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  oh... hrm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it's the only thing i can think of to explain it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: of course I could be wrong but i won't know that till I go back and check out the tower\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((oh yeah, almost forgot to show you guys the player sheet things <a href='http://piratepad.net/SBARGv2PlayerSheets'>http://piratepad.net/SBARGv2PlayerSheets</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: also I think that baten kaitos might be giving us weapons that coen side with our aspect powers\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: anyone in here have time? or breath I sort of want to test if you also get aspect alined weapons\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have time</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: need me to alchemize that thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: do you want to alchemize one? I won't force you and can you use blade kind?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have an extra unallocated strife card still, but I was thinking of allocating it so something a little less mainstream.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I could probably combine it with my prostheticleg to get something usable though</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well you don't have to use the code. if you aren't going to use the weapon why spend the grist right?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: though if you can use it i guess you can\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: wait does anyone use magic kind?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: magic was a weapon in this game though it would just be something like something flare/burst/blow #\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I wonder what would happen if i try to repicate one of these time finisher moves\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: huh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I might try for something like Chaotic Illusion, Dream Blade, or maybe Lingering Time\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: they do say pratatice makes prefect right?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *perfect\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I...guess?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: either Dream Blade of Chaotic illsion deals with stopping time to do a stabbing attack from all dictions at nearly the same time\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: meaning it should be possible to sort of reenact it. and another causes damage by stopping time and then damaging the enemy by speeding up time or something\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: does anyone use trempet kind and is either a light or void player\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: *trumpet\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I just alchemized this thig</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: i sort of want to see if these weapons keep following the pattren they have\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the menu on my digital camera modus says it's the esperanza slasher leg</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Did you say Esperanza?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ?????</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  ooooooooooh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  hope</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: Do you know how luckly it is you got that?\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :O?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: it's the second highest sword in the game and the highest time weapon\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: this is gonna be awesome</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: I'm really jelous now. if it wasn't a leg I might be tempted to steal it\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well at least now we have three people who have in aspect baten kaitos weapons\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm gonna try testing this thing outside</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: but again I can't believe you got the Esperanza. this is really cool\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: well i think i should be heading to bed my clock says it's three\l/</span><br />
