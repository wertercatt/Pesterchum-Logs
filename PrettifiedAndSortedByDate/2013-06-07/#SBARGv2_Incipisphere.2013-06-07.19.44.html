<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or better yet, lets just break the game forever and nuke the black king... no thats stupid, an even I know that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...never mind, Its no use.,</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: While I'd be all for trying to stop a violent war through the power of peace, I'm unsure if there's any way we would be able to get through to them</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...We pull the stargate episode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: other than hoisting the banner of peace and unity on the Battlefield</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: demanding an end to the fighting</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: do what now FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, that one where they fake everyone in the war dying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and eliminating those who would wish to wage further war</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ...i think that's a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Although...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Question is, would ch-he notice?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Perhaps we could, though highly improbable and not a short-term plan by any means</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: foment a rebellion of some sort?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I say we destroy both of the scepters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: If there are no kings, and there are no queens</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And we have the best interests of the session at heart</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: As obviously we need it to survive and win this game</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I say we have the white king give his sceptre to us, and we put it in the royal vault.</span><br />

<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: fl, what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: but I'd RECKON that these two are quite correct</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, how did the battleship get to earth in the post scratch session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: hoo hoo hoo!</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: You sly dog you</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Reckoning or not, an object moving fast enough will start up the defense portals.</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: 'twas most certainly worth it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: FL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: You don't know of the mechanics of fate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: This reckoning you speak of is a triggered event</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So you would rather allow chronos to win?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...sorry tt</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: It requires far more variables than just a fast object.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: of course noτ!</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: buτ τhaτ doesn'τ mean we should break τhe game ourselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhaτ would only doom us</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, what exactly did chronos ask for?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I wonder.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets make a list.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh no not this again</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Let's not rehash the old "passive fate" versus "active fate" argument</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: oh dear</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: not that word</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see, Start up the war, and codes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Let's talk about</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: not REHASH!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: Please. let's not do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: uhm</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff660d">CSV: I agree.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: er</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: terribly sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Let's talk about something productive like anything we can do to combat the glitches ourselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#730e8f">CFS: something about that particular word gives me a strange feeling of displeasure</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ornis is working on it, but besides simply giving debug reports...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Is there any way we can like lend the sessions...what, one billion total computers now or something? to the task</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is there anything we can alchemize that can repair glitches?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: There's no alchemy in it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just programing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Still, the physical manifistation of the glitches?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The problem with that is the glitches are so widely variable that they may or may not physically manifest at all until/unless they happen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Wait.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on, I'm gonna get a scan of the glitch manifestations.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The ones that look like HIM.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll be right back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Be careful.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Be wery carewful</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I am done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: So done.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I'm huntin' ewwows</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, these guys have negative health, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do they?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, I decide to use the healing shiv...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Why do you have a healing shiv</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Why is there even such a thing as a healing shiv</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This is Charles.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Are you /really/ questioning him at this late stage in the game?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: This kind of shit's just typical for him</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: You</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: 're calling this late stage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Relatively.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: We're not even fully tooled up to bumrush BK yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh whatever man, semantics. You get my underlying point</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The glitches are...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's only once we're trying to dodge whoppers while he's trying to have it his way that we'll be late game</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...the corrupted people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: ...Come again?</span><br />
