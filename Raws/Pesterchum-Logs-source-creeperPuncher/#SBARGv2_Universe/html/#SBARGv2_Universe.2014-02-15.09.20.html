<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not much. probably gonna either play some New Leaf, or continue with chapter 2 of Dangan Ronpa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........and speaking of the former, Past Me is a moron. the wiki said the Fishing Tourney was the second saturday of this month, which I thought was today... /but it was last week/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: when do you guys think we'll ever get to space? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: as soon as we get Kat back to normal</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: There seems to be a lot of delays</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, we should focus on building things, not going to space as soon as possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Building?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the other thing we need to do is, in case Ben stays awol ((siiiiiiiigh)), we need at least one other person to learn how to fly the ship. preferably more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Wait, didn't your friend Fluffy say she made a tutorial for the ship?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And only crashed once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but to be fair, that ship was meant to crash</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is why it had the struts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Do you think we should ask them for help again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you really wanna be asking for help all the time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Its better than not knowing what to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I. Only. Crashed. Once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I'd rather be informed a little than trial and error my way to death.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Thats a 50% rate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Since you said you flew only twice</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And to be fair, the circumstances were a bit bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: 50% crash rate.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: I don't want to trust that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /you/ try getting a Kerbal Tier Craft to land in the middle of a storm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and everyone survived the crash.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c6f61">CAD: Well we only have one ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 3, actually.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...eh, DSpace is hardly ever around... maybe he blasted off again.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...aaand that I don't know about. huh.</span><br />
