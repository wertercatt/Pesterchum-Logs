[07:27:18] <span style="color:#550000">CDD: The maic infused in that gem leads to an instant revival in the event that one of you dies mid-fight, instantly healing your fatal wound and leaving you at minimal capacity</span><br />

[07:28:24] <span style="color:#550000">CDD: In your video game terms an "HP to 1" effect, I might aproximate it as. Of course in that event you would immediately be crowned loser, obviously.</span><br />

[07:30:28] <span style="color:#dba521">CMV: yeah sure, why not! so that thingy up there, you see that ball?</span><br />
[07:30:37] <span style="color:#550000">CDD: Of course ending a fight nonlethally is more than fair enough, as well. Fight until your foe cannot any longer, or until they surrender.</span><br />
[07:30:41] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  slowly heads in, looking for signs to get to the spectator booth. --</span><br />

[08:39:14] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Heheheheh.</span><br />
[08:39:16] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  and by screaming, I mean howling (MV probably takes 1d4 hearing damage :P) --</span><br />
[08:39:49] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: uh... should we stop this?</span><br />
[08:39:54] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I'd imagine so, seeing as how he's been kind of like a little pest or fly. Nah.</span><br />
[08:39:58] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I'm sure he'll be fine.</span><br />
