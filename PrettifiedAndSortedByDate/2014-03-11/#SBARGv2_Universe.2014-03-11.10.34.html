<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Flared back to my house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And locked myself in.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, figures.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe I should see about fixing that giant hole in the elevator shaft... and replace the elevator.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that... shouldn't be the case.</span><br />

<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Let me have a look at it, and I'll see what I can do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except with encryption I could just button mash to get things out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So its even worse.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, button mashing, aka hollywood class hacking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: seriously though, it /should/ have automatically unlocked... unless the fact that there was still a living user connected to it didn't trip the failsafe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which means... we have to log Crux out of your modus access, then-- no, I doubt you want to be clockstuck again.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, the times when you realize when you are chatting on your implant instead of on a pair of shades that is broken beyond repair.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((FL, side question: is your mood listed as Offline, or is the chumlist borked?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( Fixed. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( OKAY GOTTA STOP SWITCHING ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I see that SAGE came and went when I was dead.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And SRB2 2.1 is gonna be released in a week, which means lua support.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (fuck yes)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Uuuu???</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Here, look at some of the HUD things that can be done with Lua. <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/275440667/screenshots/srb20018.gif'>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/275440667/screenshots/srb20018.gif</a></span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (I think the rocket wisp is also made in lua)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What even is this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ((bakanineballbakanineball))</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: ((is sonic Cirno now))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, just Sonic Robo Blast 2.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: version 2.1</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which is coming out in a week if the server keeps up its connection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I swear if someone uses trollian to cheat and download it from the future... I will be very. VERY. sad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Wh▲t's trΘΘleen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, that and the fact that the ring server kinda uses subjective time of the computers sorta to create the link to beta earth's internet connection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( IC justification for the reason why timetravelers can't just get homestuck after the giga pause and bring back news of it. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: ((Asked no one ever.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, for when I've /tried/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...god dammit when will homestuck actually have the final update :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, in a slightly related topic..</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: I dunnΘ, Uuu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Does anyone know what Ristar is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Some sort of obscure game, I'd wager.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: Wh▲t's th▲t?</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Any takers on that bet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CWD: But it dΘes sΘund like ▲ g▲me, ye▲h.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I met a guy named Ristar once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Did you really?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ristar is a game that was created by Sonic Team in 1995 for the Sega Genesis.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The main character is a anthropomorphic cartoon star with strechy arms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: What was he like? With a name like that, he had to be an interesting character</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maBgAEfzZdM'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maBgAEfzZdM</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: He was really out there I remember, a loud kinda guy but was really smooth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#3b634d">CRS: Interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: He was an Earthbender so I didn't spend a whole lot of time with him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CWD</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: But when I was on the walls we met up sometimes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The game play is /really/ similar to what the Werehog is like in sonic unleashed... in a 2D Platformer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Personally I think the werehog took a bit of inspiration from ristar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: dang... 240p SBaHJ Tier video from 08.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: To be fair, the graphics are about the same.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But yeah, I'm kinda thinking that the Wii version of Unleashed could be hacked to replace the model of the werehog with a custom ristar model.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Uh...okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...nevermind, only one other person is only slightly interested, and the rest are leaving soooo</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, could you go downstairs and make sure the lava didnt break the server somehow? I cooled it down gently and it seemed intact, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The server is fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...did he just compare Quest for Infinity to Sonic Next Gen? <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6y4UrPAdY&t=11m5s'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6y4UrPAdY&t=11m5s</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "the story of 06 is good"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *twitch*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...aaaaAAAA</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "I can criticize games because I make them." I suppose that's a fair point?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at 17m he talks about replacing Sonic with a human char, boosting the graphics and physics, and making it its own game rather than a Sonic game</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why not just replace elise with sally?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean that would fix... a /hell/ of a lot of things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One third of the game, easily.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And maybe fix up the other characters abilities, like make Silver as fast as Sonic or Shadow normally... but give sonic the boost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And maybe have another object based seal instead of having the stupid "don't cry" seal.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPpzqosuW9I'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPpzqosuW9I</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh look</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: glitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: ....Uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CRS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I've been putting myself through a /few/ AU's... I can't get to the end of any of them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you fixed the machine?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I'm trying to get to the end of an AU to help locate the virus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Which I seem to be incapable of doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I should have at least /tried/ to go through that /one/... might have actually been easy. But /nooo/, I had to gouge out my ears in the first hour.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, just... fuck those musical AUs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Are you really that dumb or is this a joke</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /you/ try to put up with a universe where everyone starts singing every two seconds before gouging out your ears and going on a murderous rampage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, I worded that wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes, the singing was an issue, and yes, maybe I over reacted... but would you have done any differently?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Uh, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Because I'm not a huge idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why couldn't I have dealt with the book version of it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What book?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...The Little Mermaid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE HELL I WOULD NOT ACCEPT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh dear frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At /least/ I only replaced a minor character.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I had to deal with a genderswap along with that shit, we wouldn't have an AU Machine anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Never heard of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But my main issue with the other AU's is I can't seem to be as skilled as the characters in those games. Stupid "no death runs".</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So you're not skilled at all is what you're saying</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the most sad part is the Doom AU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was /about/ to win... but then I got telefraged by a demon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...okay, that's just cheating by the computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: THAT ROCKET WAS ABOUT TO MAKE IMPACT WITH THE EXPOSED BRAIN.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then again, I had one ability the main character did not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The gift of slight vertical movement.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically I could aim up and down and climb shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like /waist high walls/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course that doesn't account for the time where I goombastomped some demons to get to the end of an area.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: pfft</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So yeah, I made it through 61 areas... and then failed.</span><br />
