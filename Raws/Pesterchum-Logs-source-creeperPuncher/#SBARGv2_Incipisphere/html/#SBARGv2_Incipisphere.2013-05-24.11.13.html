<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  anywho FF is partly right</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  your second gate goes to somebody else's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  to be more specific it goes to SJ's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  which is the Land of Holes and Numbers</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: SJ is part of the AE net, I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  now if you go to her land, and then take the second gate there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  actually yes that does go to AE's land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  and if you go through the second gate there it will go to DP's</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  which I believe is Moss and Vastness?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: ok\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  also AE's is Trees and Mirrors I'm pretty sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aw man...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ceca54">CFS: ~}----  but anywho once you get to LoMaV the second gate there will go to MA's land, which I just plain don't recall the name of</span><br />
