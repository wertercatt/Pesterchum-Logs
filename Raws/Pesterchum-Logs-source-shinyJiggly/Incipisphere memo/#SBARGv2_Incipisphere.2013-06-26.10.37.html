<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's funny, nobody tryed to check on me today. I guess it's understandable with all the constant shenanigans around the HQ, but at the same time it's a bit disheartening.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you know who it is?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Isn't the Denizen a thing you should be doing, like, solo?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: I know.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: unfortunately PT, Denizen-y stuff can only be done alone. it's one of the hardcoded rules of the game.</span><br />
