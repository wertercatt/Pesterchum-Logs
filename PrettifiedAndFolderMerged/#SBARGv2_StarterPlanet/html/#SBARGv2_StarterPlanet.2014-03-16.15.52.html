<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You know what you want to learn?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. I want to learn to improve myself, and to probably not be Charles-level stupid at things anymore.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: That's better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You're about to try and learn an ancient and sacred art taught to humans from dragons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You'd better respect this thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Otherwise you just get burned. Or explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I understand. respect the art, and it will respect you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You can stop when you make it here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues climbing, realizing that he actually hasn't long-distance-walked as a human for a while --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I hope you've got good cardio, because this is a martial art.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  finally gets there ((parental interruptions sigh)), panting a bit... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... I'll be fine. just haven't done it the manual way for a while...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Good, because that's the first lesson.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I want you to sit here and breath.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  sits down and starts trying to calm his breathing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Know why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... you can't stoke fire without air?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, that's part of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You can't have a flame without air, and breath is what gives us air.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Too much and it goes out, too little it dies.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So you have to learn how to control your breathing before you do anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  nods. "makes sense to me." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  picks a plant root off of the side of the mountain, lighting it on fire and handing it over to CP. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Try and keep this lit just by breathing on it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  takes it and gently blows on it, trying to keep the flames at an even level --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  the root flares and goes out, poof. fire is ded --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...too much?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Iunno, maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Might just be the wind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's important where you breath from too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: This is more of an Earthbending thing but I took it for myself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mmk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You know how to breath, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, in a specific way?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think I only know regular breathing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You have to know how to draw power in every breath.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: A higher up technique is circle breathing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: It's pretty much inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth at the same time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So you're constantly exhaling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Try it a few times, it's weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  attempts to try that ((including oocly :P)), and fails --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I see what you mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: But it is important, and you'll get it when ya practice.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Circles are probably the most important thing in firebending.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Know why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...no? something to do with energy, I'm guessing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah, pretty much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Circles are a way of letting things flow, they don't begin or end, they just flow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and it's the same with the energy between the bender and their fire, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You are the beginning and the end of the fire.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  continues with the breathing practice thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You know what fire is, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, it's a force of nature, but one that can be created by humans as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Sorta.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: What's different about fire, compared to earth, air, and water?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm pretty much drawing a blank here. ...oh wait, I got it. the other elements cannot be created from nothing, but fire can be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You got it, good for you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Fire's unique, because it comes from a human's passion and desire, it's not like the others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Earth is your strength and resolve, Water your peace and flow, and air your...horrible sense of humor, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...that's a potshot at Isaac's fruit pranks, I'm guessing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I still wonder where the heck he got Blimp Fruit seeds...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Nah I know an airbender back home who has the worst jokes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: But yeah, anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: You've gotta want it, fire is passion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: Earth is resolve, it's why I combine the two so easily.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CWG</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: So that's the first and second lessons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff520e">CPA: I don't even know you can even generate fire though, you're not a bender.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... well, ignoring my tail, I'm not sure actually...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: is the ability to bend a genetic thing, or purely by teaching?</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  actually after korra and the next male earthbender avatar, the next avatar would be a female firebender --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  it'd explain her crazy bending talent --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  avatars go m/f/ in a cycle along with cycling though bending nations. M/Air, F/Water, M/Earth, F/Fire --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  maybe the gender stays the same from Fire to Air? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  that way, you have a cycle of eight, going through the elements twice --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT prattlingAuxiliary <span style="color:#ff520e">[CPA]</span>  Because the last 4 avatars followed that pattern, then Aang, then Korra --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  Or it's not based on gender cycles at all :b --</span><br />
