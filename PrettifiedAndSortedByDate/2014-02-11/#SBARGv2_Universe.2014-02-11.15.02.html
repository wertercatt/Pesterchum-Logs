[03:56:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: assuming I have any.</span><br />
[03:56:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think all of us gods should start accepting that fact, so we don't need to deal with as much pain later on... but then again, its not always that easy to move on, is it.</span><br />
[03:57:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I haven't.</span><br />
