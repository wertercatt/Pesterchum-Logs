<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, the premise could be that pandora's box has opened and the world is chaotic in the purest sense of the word: randomness :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#c1bb10">CCS: yeah i realized that\l/</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What I like about cyberpunk is that it's not as futuristic as many people think :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, aside from a few things :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, I remember someone mentioning the thing is kind of "Deus Ex"-y?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: CP, yes :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Aside from a few things, cyberpunk is horrifically modern :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Like, the world is becoming more and more connected irl :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and that means that privacy is fading away irl :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and stuff like government watching over people isn't so far fetched. :&gt;</span><br />
