<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Anyways, I must thank you all for helping me see more clearly on recent events. I've been a bit ruled by my feelings on the matter I admit, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I'm thinking more logically now on the matter</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: figuratively speaking</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I've figured out that I need to solve my problems not by trying to...fight with them, or insult them rather?</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CCA: ∞ Maybe you need to figure out the /why/ and not the /how/ Σ</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I've thought on the manner some, and have come to some hypothesis, though nothing solid on the matter</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey guys, did I miss anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: My best guess is that my dreamself...me lacks the more solid and grounding elements which tie me to reality and sensibility, like the ability to actually think about other people and the ability to realize that for all my thinking, my ideas on how to make the world a better place were ultimately foolish, naive, and most likely harmful</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Somewhat hilariously, he is almost like a...mirror, if you will</span><br />
