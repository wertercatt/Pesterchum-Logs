<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *after disappearing from LOSARoses, she's reappeared on LOIAR and glides through the door (how odd) before transportalising up to the dojo to meet MA* Hey, you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Hey.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: No wires this time, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: And I'll stay tangible, unless you happen to be in an incredibly masochistic mood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Haha, not today, no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: So then let's get started.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: You want to keep it melee/close quarters?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: A'ight, so I'll be sticking to clawKind, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: StaffKind it is for me.</span><br />
The spar/sim room fires up in the dojo to let the two of them virtually fight.<br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Cool beans. Let's go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *considers things for a moment before slipping on a mismatched pair of claws, her left hand with a sharp-clawed grappling glove and her right with a set of knuckle-mounted claws that have a chance to make the enemy fall asleep*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *equips Screamed The Dust Speck and twirls the staff a bit before going into a ready stance*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *smiles a bit sadly to see that weapon before simply launching herself at him, claws out*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *he dashes straight at her as well, holding the staff up in front of him in defense*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *she tries to grab onto the staff with her hands, barefoot with her hind claws unsheathed to swing in and rake them down his legs*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *he quickly hops over her before he gets /too/ close, aiming the staff at her and shooting a bolt of lighting*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *she yelps, not quite fast enough to dodge the lightning and so momentarily stunned (owwww) before launching herself for him again*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *he rolls on his back to right himself after landing and facing back towards her, and holds the staff out again to block, this time crouching*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *pounces him from above, blanking out her mind so she's moving on instinct without consciously thinking about what she's going to do, nor knowing herself until the moment she does it*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *attempts to roll back again to try and avoid, but due to his position, he ends up on his back before he can right himself again*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *springs so she lands right on top of him, trying to get him in a pin with her claws at his shoulders and hind claws on his legs*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *he gets pinned and can't really move his arms, groaning in pain from the claws in him*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *simply sprawls herself over him to keep pinning him down, raking her claws down his arms and legs alike* hi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *he grits his teeth against the pain* GH--urgh... h-hi...</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: … oh, that's right. You said you weren't in a masochistic mood today. Want I should just tear out your throat instead? *smiles down at him with sharp teeth and scratches him again*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: If... you want it to be /boring/-- agh--... sure...</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Heh… nah, boring's never really been my style… *and so instead she claws him again, grinning all the more*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ARGH--!</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: What would you suggest, then~? *drags her claws carefully across his shoulders*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Ghh-- M-make me... bleed to death? 'C-Cause at... this rate...</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: Sure, I could do that easily enough. *her voice is practically a purr* I'd ask if that's what you /wanted/, but… hey, you got yourself like this, I don't particularly care. *so she claws him again, taking care to dig all four sets as deeply into him as she can*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: GHAAAH! *he seethes through his teeth, trying his best to bare the pain, but he doesn't seem to be doing that all that well with the large gashes all over him now*</span><br />
<span style="color:#447463">CAG: *this time she isn't scared but may be having just a bit too much fun with this as she once more scores him with her claws, her glove and the Cat Claw doing much more damage than just her regular ones. she's taking especial care not to hit anywhere she already has, instead raking new lines over his body as she pins him to the ground*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: *he can only scream in pain, unable to free himself while she rips more and more gashes and cuts all over his body, and his heath is dropping rapidly now*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stands up and makes her way to the other end of the room, apparently CP drew a brush portal to lofat --</span><br />
