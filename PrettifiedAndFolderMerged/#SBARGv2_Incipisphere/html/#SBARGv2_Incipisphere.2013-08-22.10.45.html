[10:29:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what's with the whammy?</span><br />
[10:29:56] <span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ???</span><br />
[10:30:00] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: So<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[10:30:00] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we're talking a higher magnitude than Unite, Synchronize, Cascade, Jade: Enter, Flip, and Intermission 2 combined</span><br />
[10:30:05] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: what the fuck is going on?</span><br />
[10:30:08] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
[10:30:23] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: AC hyping up shit we don't understand due to a lack of proper explanation</span><br />
[10:30:32] <span style="color:#339966">CDP: â‰ˆ&gt;â– â– â–¶ pretty much</span><br />
[10:30:32] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because that is just how much it will take to get our asses out of this mess</span><br />
[10:30:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: did you even look at the log?</span><br />
[10:30:44] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: yeah...</span><br />
[10:30:59] <span style="color:#339966">CDP: â‰ˆ&gt;â– â– â–¶ how about we take a moment to UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING before we try and go on a bloody suicide mission</span><br />
[10:31:01] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Who wants to be Sherlock Holmes?</span><br />
[10:31:02] <span style="color:#339966">CDP: â‰ˆ&gt;â– â– â–¶ just a thought.</span><br />
[10:31:14] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: DP</span><br />
[10:31:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it was an audable horror terror that told me to take everyone out of the session... Well...</span><br />
[10:31:18] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I am thinking</span><br />
[10:31:28] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[10:31:28] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm racking my mind for every possible thing we can do in this situation</span><br />
[10:31:38] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Guys, I have dead body and head in my inventory.</span><br />
[10:31:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'll get my necronomicon</span><br />
[10:31:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF, say wha?</span><br />
[10:32:05] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I will freaking use corspekind and smack someone if I don't get answers.</span><br />
[10:32:16] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Is this this... EG's body?</span><br />
[10:32:22] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: No.</span><br />
[10:32:30] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: It's the Dead Derse</span><br />
[10:32:37] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Oh dear god...</span><br />
[10:32:44] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: okay</span><br />
[10:32:46] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: burn it</span><br />
[10:33:02] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: just, set it on fire and chuck it as far as you can into the furthest ring</span><br />
[10:33:13] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>No, I am not doing that,</span><br />
[10:33:21] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I'm deliving it to derse.</span><br />
[10:33:26] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: They can deal with it.</span><br />
[10:33:46] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ((MM, you didn't give us anything to work with for MA's death. We need more stuff to go on))</span><br />
[10:33:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sure that's a good idea?</span><br />
[10:33:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean</span><br />
[10:34:00] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you could piss them off</span><br />
[10:34:02] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: FF, no</span><br />
[10:34:03] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: SE is right</span><br />
[10:34:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: right?</span><br />
[10:34:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: man</span><br />
[10:34:16] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: /fuck/ you</span><br />
[10:34:20] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: ?</span><br />
[10:34:23] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Jeez...</span><br />
[10:34:24] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>Look, I'm doing the right bloody thing.</span><br />
[10:34:28] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm just advising</span><br />
[10:34:30] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: No your not</span><br />
[10:34:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: there's no right decision!</span><br />
[10:34:40] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Besides, they may want to know were the body is.</span><br />
[10:34:45] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the likely /wiser/ thing to do</span><br />
[10:34:46] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: If you send it back they will be mad</span><br />
[10:34:50] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: or they will start watching you</span><br />
[10:34:50] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Right as in morals.</span><br />
[10:34:55] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: is to let someone place the body without being seen</span><br />
[10:34:58] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: we don't want to attract a ton of attention</span><br />
[10:35:04] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or to not let it be found.</span><br />
[10:35:11] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Give it to me, then FF</span><br />
[10:35:15] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I will send it</span><br />
[10:35:24] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the political backlash can cause us trouble farther down the line.</span><br />
[10:35:30] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm literally an antiliability</span><br />
[10:35:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i understand that it might feel proper to give them the body</span><br />
[10:35:37] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but perhaps</span><br />
[10:35:43] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[10:35:50] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: for the sake of not having players blacklisted when we make our move</span><br />
[10:35:53] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I plan on asking who it is.</span><br />
[10:35:56] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we could avoid it</span><br />
[10:35:59] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: FF</span><br />
[10:36:06] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Stop being so incistant</span><br />
[10:36:16] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Wait a minute...</span><br />
[10:36:18] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Everyone</span><br />
[10:36:30] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I want you all too make a decision right now</span><br />
[10:36:36] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no fuck off</span><br />
[10:36:41] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Look, the sooner we find out killed him, the sooner we don't have to worry about mind fuckers.</span><br />
[10:36:45] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: what are you, AS YOUR OWN PLAYER, going to do right now</span><br />
[10:36:54] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: continue to tell you to fuck off</span><br />
[10:36:57] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and how is that going to positively and negatively effect us?</span><br />
[10:37:19] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: feel free to answer in the memo</span><br />
[10:37:23] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but atleast think about it...</span><br />
[10:37:34] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It doesn't matter how you tell people</span><br />
[10:37:45] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: just make sure you stick to the conviction unless something else happens</span><br />
[10:38:20] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: This session is chaotic</span><br />
[10:38:30] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but I implore you to find order</span><br />
[10:38:40] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and bring that order to the chaos we are currently faced with</span><br />
[10:38:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i</span><br />
[10:38:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i</span><br />
[10:38:55] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think i'm </span><br />
[10:38:58] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i'm doing it again</span><br />
[10:38:59] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: MY GOD</span><br />
[10:39:05] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SOME ONE STOP M- </span><br />
[10:39:09] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: fuck off</span><br />
[10:39:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .</span><br />
[10:39:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .</span><br />
[10:39:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: .</span><br />
[10:39:23] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I think if we can do that</span><br />
[10:39:26] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: We can save this session</span><br />
[10:39:31] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Our selves</span><br />
[10:39:47] <span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and whatever other thing needs saving that wasn't mentioned above</span><br />
[10:40:09] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: show of hands</span><br />
[10:40:14] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: who's actually reading this?</span><br />
