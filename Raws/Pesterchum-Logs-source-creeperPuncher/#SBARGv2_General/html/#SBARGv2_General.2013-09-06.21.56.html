<span style="color:#887000">CSL: a character backstory would have them losing a loved one and having them turned into a bionic limb</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what happened after CEP: That's how bad it is :&gt; CEP: Boktai, that is :&gt; CSL: why ?</span><br />

<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So much pasting to do :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: which having it part of the characters knowledge as opposed to just a dumb twist could be good</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: CSL: why do you need to be outside CEP: Because your character requires sunlight or some shit :&gt; CSJ: oh yeah, that's the one that literally requires sunlight in order to play ➜ CSL: hahahawhat CSL: thats incredible CRS: It's a Hideo game, the MC hunts vampires and such CSL: and if you want to play it at night, fuck you CSL: definitely need that one CSJ: unless you hav like, a heat lamp ➜ CRS: If</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">play at night you can still play, you just have fewer options and have to stealth, I think CSJ: dunno the exact mechanic of how it detects it ➜ CSL: but yes should the stupid bc09 twist be part of the crossover setting CSJ: um, probably not? ➜ CSL: so bionic limbs should just be cyborg stuff with no terrible genetic bonding nonsense CEP: Imagine if every single part of your body was bionic :&gt; :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Have fun, CP :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: welp</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well in bc09 its not revealed that his wife is an arm until the very end</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I saw this one tumblr post that reminds me of the humor I often have :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Where this person was like "lick my pu**y" and someone replied "lick your own damn puppy" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: despite him having had the arm for 3-5 games depending on what you consider canon</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I would so be the one saying "lick your own damn puppy" :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and never knowing until the end</span><br />
