<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like, doctorSpace</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe she was there, but not a space player</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if i was writing something about like the tomb of horrors crawl you wouldnt be mentioned</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dude, that timeline has completely different classpects and everything</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like bringing up Amy in a small off topic rant?</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: necessarily</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean holy shit the coincidences that led to me meeting amy are incredible</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i dont think theres any branch before i did that would lead to me still meeting her</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sounded like the branch broke off before Chronos was revealed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, the gates seems to still be a thing in that timeline...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that's kind of how it works, SL. a bunch of seemingly unrelated things add up to big events, and if even one is changed, the whole chain breaks.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (heh. look at me getting philosophical about Time, and I'm not even that aspe-- yeah, butterfly effect.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: uh, brb</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: still raises the question of who Sophia was... eh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its a doomed timeline, the only thing we should keep from that is the codes</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: maybe i adopted some other consort and named her that</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean i think the adoption thing was going to happen one way or another</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but seriously i  have to go deal with stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: why would I fight sophia then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: GROUNDED CHILDREN</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: augh why does everything make no sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...amys a good kid and she almost doomed the timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: a brattier child could have done worse</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: when is she ungrounded again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hey, I think Homestuck updated...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, it did</span><br />

<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: hey im back</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: shes grounded til this sunday</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its less than she deserves, but this is the first time ive actually punished her</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: scolded, yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but punished, no</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so, yet more evidence against my parenting skills</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: SL, you are a good parent. You care about Amy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: don't ever tell yourself otherwise.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and most of the time i feel that way</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but sometimes i wonder</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if ive been doing things right</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the worst part is that im all alone in this</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: im the only parent here</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean ash had her siblings or nieces or whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Talk to CC's mom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but its different when youre the only one responsible for the kid</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ive actually needed to talk to her anyway about amy's nightmares</span><br />
