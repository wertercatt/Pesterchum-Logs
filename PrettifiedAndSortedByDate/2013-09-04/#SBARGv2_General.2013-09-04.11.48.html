<span style="color:#7ccfb2">?AG: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hi EP.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: yay :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So AG, I actually want you :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: er...I want you because :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Of business :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Not "want you" want you :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: See, rp me stroke a deal with dubiousSwa(i)n  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And so I gotta tell the dude the secret to channeling his mage of blood power :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I was thinking, based on the little infurrmation I uncovered, I would say it would be like earthbending a la avatar :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What do you think, AG? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: 750k boonbucks are resting on this, and IC doesn't like to disappoint customers. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I have no idea how Mages of Blood work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I know about Blood just fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: well, SL just thought I should get your approval in general :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: since there really is no canon on mage of blood :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: And DS (the swan DS) wanted the approval from the general memo befurr we do any deals IC :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … why my appurroval?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And okay, lemme… go epic research mode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Because SL seems to think you're the general memo approval head honcho :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: even though that tends to be NN :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: (though NN isn't here) :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Also, SL brought up trogdor :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *rolls over onto his back* Well don't /I/ feel special now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#247f0b">CURRENT foolishDream [CFD]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#247f0b">CFD: ...huh. really.?</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Oh, by the way, AG, my denizen is Eris.  :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Really what, FD? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i brought up ag because shes the most likely to say no</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so if shes down with it, everyone else probably will be too</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's 'cause I'm a bitch~ *rooolllllls*</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I was asking for the consent of the memo and you wanted me to get consent from the person most likely to say no :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Twisted :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: well, if I like it, the others will purrobably not give a fuck or can be talked into it by me. :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I like it, though :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Eris...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Eris (Ancient Greek: Ἔρις, "Strife") is the Greek goddess of chaos, strife and discord, her name being translated into Latin as Discordia. "Discordia" means discord. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I checked the denizen list :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, that's who I was thinking.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: No one else has it :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Sweetness.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I need to find a chaos/discord/Void Denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: for LOHAC.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: I don't think Loki's taken :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Surprisingly :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Also, you could go with Puck :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Though Puck is a faerie :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Not a god/goddess :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: fuck yes puck</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: If you want a god, there's the god of the fairies, Oberon :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Loki. I have /Hel/ as a Denizen. That would just be. o.o</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Puck is my favorite of the faeries, though :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Lord, what fools these mortals be!</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: ... Erisa.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: //smiles wryly </span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Erisa? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *rolls*</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: It's... a long story. And related to something else.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: ah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: But the idea was based on Eris.</span><br />
<span style="color:#410f41">CSA: I just got reminded is all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Still, goddess of chaos (and not talking about the sonic chaos) :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: when I was 12 or 13 I was obsessed with the chao from sonic :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also, sonic chaos was a sonic game on the game gear apparently ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: either that or the master system, I forgot ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: interesting :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: So AG, if you already have a denizen, why do you need one for LoHaC? :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I may be running Land Quest dungeons there, as ICly I'm working on its Land Quest.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Well, there's plenty of chaotic myth gods/goddesses/creatures :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Puck is still my favorite of the faeries :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Aye… I'll have to look up what ones would be appropriater for a Rogue of Void.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ah :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: There's also anansi, he's a trickster god :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: he takes the form of a spider :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: and he tricks people :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: with his spiderness :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: nyooope no spiders never spiders aaaah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#247f0b">CFD: anansi is a cool dude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /spiders/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: well, still going to recommend puck. Although puck is more rogue of breath, not rogue of voidish. :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#247f0b">CFD: He Has all the stories.</span><br />
