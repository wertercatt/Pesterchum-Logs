<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I recomend using cardstock instead of captcha cards so no one else makes this mistake.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell, I made a new consort with the code, but it just made a random consort... none of the memorys...</span><br />
<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: :C</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: :C</span><br />

<span style="color:#41742f">CNN: (GFD)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess you can't fit a lifetime of memorys in a 2^48 area space.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do I lie about the consorts demise? Do I avoid the entire thing? Do I tell the truth? Do I wipe out the entire village so noone ever finds out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6505ff">CTT: .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I think maybe you should drop the random consort off and hope that they don't ask you anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so lie and say it was memory loss.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god, hold on, its eating the rug.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, I captchaed him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: be careful</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...actually, I managed to make a rocket pack... so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll strap the guy in and shoot him at the village.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering that it is a complete idiot, the chances of him crashing is pretty high.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So memory loss wouldn't be that hard to feign.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, I have a better idea...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, I'd have to time it JUST right or else we get a doomed timeline.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's your plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Use the appearifier and sendificator.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In order to pull off a swap.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...or would I just get slime?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think I want to just time it right.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: I kinda missed the meteors, but I managed to turn around before going too far out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: darn it, I was busy typing somerthing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: It worked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was going to say that plan reminded me of a really spoilery thing from a specific video game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: Though for some reason, the villagers had said I just left a few minutes ago.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: Chrono Trigger?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I didn't want to ruin anyone's experience with that game by talking about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: I don't think anyone else is paying attention :o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: Actually, come to think about it, I was thinking more of a certain harry potter fanfic that did the same thing at the time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: So, I did a 2 tier ripoff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, nothing's new in paradox space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or so I've been told.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: ...i like to think its orignal...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">?FL: ...at least some of my plans.</span><br />
