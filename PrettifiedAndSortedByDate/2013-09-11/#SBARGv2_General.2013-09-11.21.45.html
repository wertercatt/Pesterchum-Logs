<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: i'd alʃo love an archer Zelda, but that'd be hard with the Game Pad...</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: What I was thinking, too, is that since Link can use both magic and equipment, so can Zelda, but like, one is better suited for the other. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: god.  the thingʃ you could do with boʃʃ battleʃ</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yeah. It reminds me a bit also of the final battle against ganon in wind waker :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: Zelda sorta helped out there :&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#133295">CEP: With what I'm thinking of, there could be bosses where if they tried to go solo, it wouldn't be enough and they'd have to use both of their skills. :&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CWD: too much backtracking sucks though x-x</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff9e01">CSS: I love it.  Cauʃe it meanʃ there'ʃ more ʃtuff to find</span><br />
