[05:10:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Better rearrange the stuff in my modus, save the ribbons for emergencys.</span><br />

[05:16:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like diamonds in minecraft.</span><br />
[05:17:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While you can just go into creative mode and build your house out of diamond, its much more fun to actually mine them out of the ground in survival.</span><br />
[05:19:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, then you slowly approach the point where thats the end of the game, and it gets boring again.</span><br />
[05:19:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is why I like modded minecraft, since it adds alot more to it.</span><br />
