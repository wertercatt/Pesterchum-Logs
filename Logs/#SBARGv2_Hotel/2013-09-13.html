[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#55aa00">CPK</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 HOTEL.</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  has all the amulets, all of them. --</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  wanders out of his room --</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CURRENT creeperPuncher [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so, Dolo never happened, we're still in the library talking about our pasts))</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  goes to libary --</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  is covered in amulets of protection against evil... and one that generates salt if activated. --</span><br />
[08:57] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Sawp bitches</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh hi.</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: what up</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks back at the giant snow globe, only a crater and destroyed buildings being the last things showing... --</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#7ccfb2">CURRENT apocalypseGambit [CAG]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Nothin' much, uh… whoever you are. Just chatting about where we came from. What we've seen.</span><br />
[08:58] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is also staring at the snowglobe*</span><br />
[08:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[08:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pushes the button, it shinking back to normal size, putting it away. --</span><br />
[08:59] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  looks over at the newcomer, confused --</span><br />
[09:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so... yeah.</span><br />
[09:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: basically weaponized miniature suns.</span><br />
[09:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: [[((k, starting up my desktop to play Black Mesa, possible wifi reboot imminent!))]]</span><br />
[09:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's… really cool and… /really/ scary, FL.</span><br />
[09:03] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Can you do that?</span><br />
[09:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I could... but I think the better questions is... would I?</span><br />
[09:03] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: [[((hooray, nothing exploded! it seems Bridge Connection wifi reboot only happens on desktop /shutdown/...))]]</span><br />
[09:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why would you want to do something that bad?</span><br />
[09:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That... thats one of the things I have sworn not to do... not on that big of a level...</span><br />
[09:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … *is staring at him, wide-eyed* /You can summon suns/?</span><br />
[09:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit, it isn't summoning suns...</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( … Uh, why're you calling her Gambit? ))</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... well, technically, I /can/ summon the sun... but it's only a tiny painted one...</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( fklidhgzkigab THATS WHY ))</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it isn't summoning suns exactly.</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( She was called AG by the Void monster thing, but otherwise she's introduced herself as AG or Alanna. ))</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: (( jsyk ))</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … /you/ can summon a sun, puppy?</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why can everyone but me do this?</span><br />
[09:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its more like... causing the reaction to /form/ a sun...</span><br />
[09:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been doing it by polymorphing tiny ammounts of antimatter...</span><br />
[09:07] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  walks over to a window and looks out it; he waves his tail in a circle, and a small stylized sun appears outside --</span><br />
[09:09] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  looks out the window... --</span><br />
[09:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...huh.</span><br />
[09:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: */stares/*</span><br />
[09:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … okay. Can /I/ learn to do this?</span><br />
[09:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm not sure if I can trust you with the power to weaponize /that/</span><br />
[09:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno. you got a tail that doubles as a reality-effecting inkbrush?</span><br />
[09:10] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I'm Patrick. Hier of Hope.</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and all this ability really does is just change night to day somehow, and light dark areas.</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, come on. All reds learn to summon suns /eventually/, it's part of our training.</span><br />
[09:11] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Reds?</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah. Red mages? I was in training to be one. Long time ago.</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm sorry, I used sun as a comparison.</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: really, a sun is much larger than that...</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: oh cool</span><br />
[09:12] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's okay, I'll start with a mini sun! I'm not picky.</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I'm going to go kill a thing dead</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah... lets try a different method of this... without fusion.</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Is that okay?</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I guess I could look into summoning demons.</span><br />
[09:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How does a sphere of plasma sound?</span><br />
[09:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What's plasma again?</span><br />
[09:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[09:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...hold on.</span><br />
[09:14] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  digs in his bag. --</span><br />
[09:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know the magnetic containment is around here somewhere...</span><br />
[09:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: aha!</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  pulls out a large ring... and heads to the lounge. --</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...actually, lets go outside for this.</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Come on!</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  follows --</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  walks outside and sets it on the ground. --</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  walks outside --</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  looks for things he can kill --</span><br />
[09:15] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  presses a button, and a small ripple can be seen in the air, but not much else. --</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *has followed, watching eagerly*</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...can any of you create fire?</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to be using a lightning spell...</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *snaps her fingers to create a small flame*</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *is holding it in the palm of her hand* Not at all.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright, put it in the middle of the ring.</span><br />
[09:16] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, you do it then.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: *sets the flame down carefully* Told you I was red.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  watches --</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and if you are wearing anything metal, please keep it away from the device...</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  BACKS UP BY A LOT --</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... magnetic metal.</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright...</span><br />
[09:17] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  puts away his reflector just in case --</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay cool.</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  is wearing like pure Catonium Cat Armour, and pure Catonium is very magnitic --</span><br />
[09:18] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: What is the menium safe destence?</span><br />
[09:19] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  focuses on the flame... and suddenly it explodes into a sphere of a blazing gas that almost looks like a liquid due to the way it flows... --</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and there you have it.</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: O_O</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Holy fuck/!</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Teach me how!</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its not going to last long, so just... look at it.</span><br />
[09:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, if you put lightning through flame, you get that...</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What, really?</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wow...</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … /how do I make lightning/.</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plasma is ionized gas... I can teach you to make that...</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yes good.</span><br />
[09:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but... nuclear fusion and fission... no.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: now, plasma can be contained with magnetic fields, like the one this ring is making... if I were to turn it off...</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  stands the fuck back... --</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, it would expand rapidly.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I won't.</span><br />
[09:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … so will you teach me how to make magic liquid fire and suns?</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... thats kinda the outside part of a sun...</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can teach you that... but the heart of a sun... thats too dangerous.</span><br />
[09:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't be silly, it's one of the last things a red mage learns.</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like black mages don't get to use the dimension circles proper.</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and does a red mage learn to know when to /stop/ before that?</span><br />
[09:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey! Discipline is a very important part of mage training!</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Burn one person you loved to a charred, smoking corpse, and you're pretty much guaranteed to never do it again!</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and what if you accidently burn a city?</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: a /planet/?</span><br />
[09:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, don't worry. Usually we have our powers under control by the time we're like, nine.</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: yeah im just going to keep backing up</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not a red mage... I don't know how you were taught this.</span><br />
[09:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: infact, I would say this would be a rather different method than what a red mage would use...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I knew anything at all...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just seems...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this isn't just normal fire manipulation...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this leads further on a cosmic scale...</span><br />
[09:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Well, I woke up one day with my bed on fire, and then Father apprenticed me to Master Oshin. It's about that simple.</span><br />
[09:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … how the cosmic whatsit, though?</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, there are 3 states of matter.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, there is a fourth.</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /Plasma/</span><br />
[09:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is like... an ionized gas.</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: everything in the universe is made out of... little circles.</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, if I ran an electrical charge through water, a liquid, I could seperate it into two gasses...</span><br />
[09:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: circles? huh... interesting...</span><br />
[09:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, these circles bind together to make the objects we know.</span><br />
[09:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plasma is when you bounce even tinyer circles off and onto those circles.</span><br />
[09:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its an Ionized gas...</span><br />
[09:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where electricity is flowing through it... however, heat is also required...</span><br />
[09:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: otherwise, the circles can't move fast enough to become like that.</span><br />
[09:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: these circles are made up of even tiner circles, which move so fast they basically are everywhere around that circle...</span><br />
[09:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and those tiny tiny circles... are made up of tiny tiny tiny /tiny/ so tiny you couldn't even imagine, strings.</span><br />
[09:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that are literally the thinest thing possible...</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they are one dimentional... and yet, go into 11 different dimentions...</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which ones?</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, you could say this sphere right here is three dimentional...</span><br />
[09:36] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  points at the plasma ball --</span><br />
[09:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and text on a piece of paper would be two...</span><br />
[09:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: those are /spacial/ dimentions... not alternate universes like you know of.</span><br />
[09:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh.</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: strings would be like a straight line... with only length, no width or height...</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at such a small level... things get... weird.</span><br />
[09:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how do you get... eight more, though?</span><br />
[09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...imagine branching a line off of a straight line... turning one dimention into two... then branching off of the paper into the air to make three...</span><br />
[09:39] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: going further would be branching past the spacetime we exist in...</span><br />
[09:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the /way/ those dimentions are also control the laws of physics and the conditions in universes...</span><br />
[09:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CNN</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[09:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Magic works at the quantum level, ignoring all of those pesky laws of physics.</span><br />
[09:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you can literally create energy out of nothing with magic...</span><br />
[09:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: something that most people would say is impossible.</span><br />
[09:41] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I wish I could Magics</span><br />
[09:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but anyway... it gets pretty complicated, and I don't know it /that/ well...</span><br />
[09:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … this all sounds entirely fascinating.</span><br />
[09:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((did you just go Sorcerer's Apprentice on us? the live-action one that takes place in NYC, I mean.))</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( more like methods of rationality. ))</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( but yeah. ))</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Do you have to be born magical or is something you can learn to do?</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CURRENT propinquitousEssence [CPE]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT propinquitousEssence <span style="color:#000000">[CPE]</span>  kicks off his sheets, slips into his shoes, and gnoshes a pile of biscuits for breakfast. "DeeeeliciouS." Now to find out just what's 'sup'... --</span><br />
[09:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, there are magical rituals to unlock magical ability in someone...</span><br />
[09:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: There are natural and made mages.</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you mean like what that one wolf did to give her power to me?</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that kind of thing?</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If you don't have any mana abilities, I think there's a ritual you can do to… something something technobabble… whatever? Or transfer capability to another.</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: But… magic works differently everywhere.</span><br />
[09:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: In all the dimensions, and even just places in different ones.</span><br />
[09:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: sounds awesome</span><br />
[09:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT propinquitousEssence <span style="color:#000000">[CPE]</span>  shlubs from his room to the gym, to the elevator, then down to the lobby. Maybe the funny little man that gave him his room key was abouts, and could tell him exactly what's 'sup'. --</span><br />
[09:47] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  walks into the lobby --</span><br />
[09:47] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Oh hello</span><br />
[09:47] <span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Hey!</span><br />
[09:48] <span style="color:#2b2b2b">CPE: Haven't met you yet, I don't think. I'm new, got my room a few days ago. Then I dropped into a sugar coma...</span><br />
[09:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah... well, it actually stems from the method of activation...</span><br />
