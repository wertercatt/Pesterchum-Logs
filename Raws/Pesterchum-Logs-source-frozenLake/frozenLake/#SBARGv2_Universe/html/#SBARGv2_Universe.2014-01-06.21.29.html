[03:26:28] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, I think if you change the terraingen settings when a map already exists, it /might/ start using the new ones for new chunks... idk if the seed and settings are saved with the map itself in SMP like it is in singleplayer</span><br />

[03:28:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not there, but I'm adding it to be sure.</span><br />

[03:35:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, I'll get the mods folder dropboxed</span><br />
[03:37:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so... I just instance a clean 1.6.4.jar, do the switchy-aroundy stuff, dump all the mods into the jar, and I'm good?</span><br />
[03:37:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: *well, Forge, then OptiFine, then the other mods, but basically that</span><br />
[03:39:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just do Forge and Optifine in the jar.</span><br />
