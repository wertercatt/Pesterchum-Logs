<span style="color:#c31212">CND: your playing a game</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: inside of a game</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Gosh darn FTB master race</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: seems legit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Say gameception and I'll kill ya</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: GAMECEPTION!</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: &gt;:D</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: I use the DW20 pack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Building an underwater base is fun!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: now play the SburbCraft map on the server.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: ...dealing with no trees?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: not so much.</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((I love that map))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: dw20 pack? texture thing, or a mod?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((I was literally playing that an hour ago))</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: Its one of the packs you can get using the FTB launcher.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...? what. Is today the 'I don't get it day', or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I mean, I have no idea what thing ****ing hell is bloody going on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: I've been meaning to play with TerraFirmaCraft, but I've been busy with, well, game stuff. and procrastinating on the image recaplogs I'm supposed to be making.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CURRENT shinyJiggly [CSJ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been trying to play on NN's server today, but it's been acting a bit spotty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: yeah, I think Horrorterror ISP is doing server maintenance "today"...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...TerraFirmaCraft?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Via furthest ring, I take it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: which also means that Skaipe call with future me is gonna have to wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Thats why you should always have a backup horrorterror</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FF, it's a mod that makes the game a lot more realistic and adventurely</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ...kay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: use the OGLOGOTH network. Its WAY better.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: normally, I'd be using the Fluthulu server, but they recently put up a zero-tolerance gristtorrent policy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: ...Why not build your own server?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: then again, their transtimeline download speed is much better than GlybglobNet</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: We have the grist.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00c0a0">CFL: gotta go</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: FL, because it's not a local connection I'm trying to make, it's an out-of-session one</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: Which version of gristtorrent do you have?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: seriously, even if you were a dual-claspect Time and Void player, would YOU be able to maintain a temporally stable connection both to our future selves AND to the alternate-Earth timeline where Sbarg was never a thing? that's why furthest-ring servers are so essential to accessing the internet outside the incipisphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: They have a bunch of modded ones</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ND, v6.12 iirc. but it's that Fluthulu blocks the entire .gtorrent protocol itself, at least attempts to connect to out-of-session clients</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm going to slap that guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((and since the refrance is probably going over your thinkpan: I'm parodying Comcast's completely real anti-torrenting-regardless-of-purpose policy that may or may not be limited to my area))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...good luck with that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: try not to get eaten</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: as long as you stay up-to-date on the anti-grimdarkness patches, it's completely safe</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((back later, gotta do a thing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which one what</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: ((sorry, there was a gas leak))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: OGLOGOTH is special because I hacked the system</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: so you can pretty much get away with anything on it</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: but there are an endless number of OGLOGOTHs</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: so be careful which one you try to use</span><br />
<span style="color:#c31212">CND: because I only managed to hack the one...</span><br />
