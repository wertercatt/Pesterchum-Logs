<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Would someone maybe help me move them</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: these shelves are huge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Maybe, EG.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i could come over maybe though i don't think i'd be much help</span><br />

<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Its going to take a LOT of strength to move these huge shelves</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I remember joking on the Hotel memo that EP might have managed to create a magical manifestation...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: What if WD is one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: maybe it's part of ya land quest, EG?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I know it is...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Unless...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Maybe I have to move them with light somehow?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: W-what do you mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: actually that sounds a lot more like a light player</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they dont really deal with brute force</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you might be more able once you go god tier</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: I guess it might have to do with some kind of solar energy or something like that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: love how two different subjects are happening and my brain feels it has to take both in at once.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I really do.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL:  <span style="color:#20b0e0">Huh, I thought I turned that off.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what happened to your house?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: It got destroyed before I entered the medium</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: There was a big earthquake a couple hours before I even started the game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that sucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you mean meteors hitting nearby.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: Leveled the place except for the bottom floor, which has a huge hole in the roof</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: It wasn't meteors</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Judging from the ammount of months...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: this was several hours before the meteors started falling</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: how many months has it been?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: gosh... it's been a while, thats for sure...</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all months = hours for the entry time... its weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Most of us entered in the first hour of meteors falling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: So yeah, if you see the ruins of a home when you pass through my land, don't be surprised</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: yikes<span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FL, I have a theory about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f4f4f">CWD: I am so lost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's been a bit more than five months since the session began, I think...</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: damn really</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'around that amount of time, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So perhaps 5 hours since the meteors started falling.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Back on earth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Basically, because of all the glitches, there was lag in between somme people entering and some actually ending.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ive slept a lot and been on my own a lot but five months</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like that room in DBZ where a year was a day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#aa00ff">CEG: hyperbolic time chamber</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'would make sense, kinda.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: except in this case a year in here would be half a day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: or 12 hours.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for 12 months</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: i need to sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: good night</span><br />
