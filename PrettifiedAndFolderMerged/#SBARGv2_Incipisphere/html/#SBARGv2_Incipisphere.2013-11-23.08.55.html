[10:42:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am eating a delicious Sandwich.</span><br />
[10:42:34] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Good for you.</span><br />
[10:42:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now with the war over, it seems like people are opening... sandwich shops on Skaia.</span><br />
[10:43:07] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... On skaia, of all places? Really?</span><br />
[10:43:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I walked into a building and walked out with less boondollars and a sandwich in hand.</span><br />
[10:44:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Well there you go.</span><br />
[10:44:52] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So, besides skaia-sandwiches, much of anything else happen whilst I was gone for two days?</span><br />
[10:44:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So yes, really.</span><br />
[10:44:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: um...</span><br />
[10:45:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Did you look in the sky yesterday?</span><br />
[10:45:37] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Okay, what exploaded/what should I have seen if I did?</span><br />
[10:46:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was a weapons test far away from the lands.</span><br />
[10:46:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it made an amazing explosion.</span><br />
[10:47:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: With a radius of only 500 meters.</span><br />
[10:47:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
[10:47:25] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh... Dare I ask what you were testing?</span><br />
[10:47:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I suppose if I can carry it around, its worth it.</span><br />
[10:47:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, how much do you know about bucky balls?</span><br />
[10:47:48] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: uh</span><br />
[10:47:56] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: next to nothing</span><br />
[10:48:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I ended up containing single positrons inside of each bucky ball, situated inside of a block.</span><br />
[10:48:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which then I strapped some C4 to and blew it up.</span><br />
[10:48:51] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Welp.</span><br />
[10:49:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, I guess its an antimatter explosive that doesn't go up instantly after being made.</span><br />
[10:49:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And that you can carry around.</span><br />
[10:49:31] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: That's... good.</span><br />

[10:49:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I was just telling Hannah about the weapons test yesterday.</span><br />
[10:50:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I might have left out the bit about me having to yell at PO to get the hell out of the blast radius.</span><br />
[10:50:46] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: But yeah its like... "I don't know what to do with this" ---&gt; "Let's see what happens if we blow it up."</span><br />
[10:51:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering I made it as a weapon because I was bored, yeah.</span><br />
[10:52:47] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh. You shouldnt have many chances to use it now, thankfully.</span><br />
[10:52:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Yeah I'm just going Mythbusters tier crazy.</span><br />
[10:53:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Unless the main problems can be solved by explosions, then idonno.</span><br />
[10:54:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, not everything can be solved with explosives.</span><br />
[10:54:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just the majority of stuff.</span><br />
[10:54:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And sometimes that isn't the best solution.</span><br />
[10:54:41] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Shocking, I know.</span><br />
[10:56:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ((~time))</span><br />

[10:58:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I also brought up the subject about how Immortality is going to suck big time.</span><br />
[10:58:35] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oh?</span><br />
[10:58:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so assume you have a consort friend, that lives to about, say, 50.</span><br />
[10:59:23] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Aaaah, right. The main problem: Not everyone can be ageless.</span><br />
[10:59:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eventually, if you stay friends with the family, his great great great great great grandson is going to find a picture of you and the first consort friend, and ask about it...</span><br />
[11:00:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I came up with a slight solution, but Alex said it was a bad idea... considering he kinda did it.</span><br />
[11:00:30] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm? What now?</span><br />
[11:00:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Every 200 years or so, we would wipe portions of our memories...</span><br />
[11:00:43] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uuuuuh</span><br />
[11:00:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I figure thats gonna be mandatory anyways.</span><br />
[11:01:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since the human brain is not infinite in its capacity.</span><br />
[11:01:28] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah I agree with Alex. - Eeeeh, It'll happen on its own time.</span><br />
[11:01:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So uh, yeah.</span><br />
[11:02:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've been trying to figure out the code for a Pensieve.</span><br />
[11:02:29] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ? Why so?</span><br />
[11:02:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a what?</span><br />
[11:02:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because I... don't wanna forget everything.</span><br />
[11:03:04] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: oh derf. Right. That thing. Forgot what is was for a second.</span><br />
[11:03:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know that some memories will eventually fade, but other than transhumanism as a solution, thats likely what I'm going to have to do.</span><br />
[11:04:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: FL, then you face the problem with keeping anything important in only one place: You have the risk of loosing all of it suddenly.</span><br />
[11:05:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Are you suggesting we put our memories on... some sort of cloud server?</span><br />

[11:07:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...EQ, how much should I trust a denizen of a dead land?</span><br />
[11:07:42] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Uh... Well, it depends on the denizen. </span><br />
[11:08:35] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ??</span><br />
[11:09:25] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Just like people, some you can just trust and some you cant. Dead-land denizens don't have much to do with their time, normally... so I'm not sure.</span><br />
[11:10:19] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Basically: Meet face-to-face. The denizen loves things like chaos, treachery, and sadness... don't trust it.</span><br />
[11:10:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: She often tries to be gentle, but considering her size and strength, that doesn't really work out too well.</span><br />
[11:10:36] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -That rule goes for anything living, basically.</span><br />
[11:10:43] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah, okay.</span><br />
[11:11:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I don't think either me or PK really like the accidental haircuts.</span><br />

[11:16:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Huh</span><br />
[11:17:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one whos room on one of the evac ships got toilet papered by a single consort.</span><br />

[11:25:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...remember when we all did that silly color quiz?</span><br />
[11:25:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was worded in such a way that it would be painfully accurate for everyone?</span><br />
[11:26:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the color quiz did jack shit for me...</span><br />
[11:27:08] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: either it was broken, or I was doing it /very/ wrong</span><br />
[11:27:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ehh</span><br />
[11:27:26] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 's how those quizzes work: They write it in a way so everything can apply to almost anyone.</span><br />
[11:27:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, thats what was said back then.</span><br />
[11:27:58] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: AKA exactly how fortune cookies work.</span><br />
[11:28:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I ate at a consort place once where they gave out fortune cookies at the end.</span><br />
[11:28:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Mine was blank.</span><br />

[11:29:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[11:30:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
[11:30:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ........yeah.</span><br />
[11:31:01] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay, don't tell me you are even slightly worried about that.</span><br />
[11:31:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well I'm not /anymore/.</span><br />
[11:31:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just the timing was terrifying in hindsight.</span><br />
[11:31:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;:?</span><br />
[11:32:08] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Good, then! You should have more sense than to worry over a peice of paper that was stuffed in a cookie.</span><br />
[11:32:17] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -and eh fair enough I suppose.</span><br />
[11:32:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering it was when I had the countdown going on my watch.</span><br />
[11:33:02] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Ah... okay.</span><br />

[11:36:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I guess its like the air being sucked off earth with the portal on the moon.</span><br />
[11:36:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Only with water.</span><br />
[11:37:18] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: pft</span><br />
[11:37:54] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: man, what if stargates didn't have the thing blocking water flow through it?</span><br />
[11:38:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it would've /ruined/ the russian base that one episode...</span><br />
[11:38:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or they could have just shut off the gate.</span><br />
[11:38:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not like water is a black hole.</span><br />
[11:39:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right?</span><br />
[11:40:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus you know, other than radio signals, stargates are one way.</span><br />
[11:40:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: true... but the gate won't shut down if something's in transit.</span><br />
[11:40:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yes it will.</span><br />
[11:40:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and I mean dialing in /from/ the water planet</span><br />
[11:40:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, they managed to cut off the dudes head in like, the second episode.</span><br />
[11:41:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: meh, guess you're right</span><br />
[11:41:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually, wouldn't the massive amount of water be counted as a single object?</span><br />
[11:42:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And not go through like the people in the front of the puddle jumper in that one episode?</span><br />
[11:42:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: think that only applies to solid objects...</span><br />
[11:42:56] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, this. <a href='https://xkcd.com/571/'>https://xkcd.com/571/</a></span><br />
[11:43:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If that were the case, people would be going through with out the fluids in their body.</span><br />
[11:43:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...why am I trying to discuss this when doctor who is distacting me?</span><br />
[11:44:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because science fiction discussion.</span><br />
[11:44:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That is basically science fact now due to alchemiters.</span><br />
[11:44:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Think someone could alchemize a TARDIS?</span><br />
[11:45:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on.</span><br />
[11:45:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DAMMIT</span><br />
[11:45:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't have that much grist!</span><br />
[11:45:24] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: woah what</span><br />
[11:45:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Let me just count the number of zeros...</span><br />
[11:45:42] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It's a thing you can make? Seriously?</span><br />
[11:45:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...dammit, I lost count at 50.</span><br />
[11:45:59] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I mean it shouldnt surprise me, but still.</span><br />
[11:46:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I estimate that there are 100 zeros in the grist cost.</span><br />
[11:47:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, roughly 2^256 grist? of every type, or just some?</span><br />
[11:47:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just Zillium.</span><br />
[11:47:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........how the /fuck/</span><br />
[11:48:13] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: For... people with a lot of time to somehow aquire that much zillium? I guess?</span><br />
[11:49:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's... kinda-sorta impossible for non-tricksters to get that much.</span><br />
[11:49:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I had to use the Laser Station to read the code, too.</span><br />
[11:49:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: by the way, how many zeroes in "One Zillion"?</span><br />
[11:49:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 0.</span><br />
[11:50:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just the game fucking with you, items that cost one zillion grist cost 1 of that grist type.</span><br />
[11:51:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, I doubt anyone could get 1 googol of Zillium.</span><br />
[11:51:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Unless they were lords of time itself.</span><br />
[11:52:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I wanted to get that much grist, it would require a fuckton of doomed timelines.</span><br />
[11:52:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since while people can be doomed, information and objects are... different.</span><br />
[11:52:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As such, Grist can't really be doomed.</span><br />
[11:54:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its also interesting that Grist does not collide with itself.</span><br />
[11:54:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you'd have to do the repeatedly-killing-same-enemies thing from Dave: Accelerate... /while in trickster mode/ so all grist dropped is zillium</span><br />
[11:54:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, if you are in a doomed timeline, get a space hero to shrink a planet and recycle it in the past.</span><br />
[11:55:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sounds exactly like something a trickster would do.</span><br />
[11:55:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...true.</span><br />
[11:55:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: remind me to NEVER LET YOU GO TRICKSTER.</span><br />
[11:55:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...or let /myself/ go trickster, for that matter.</span><br />
[11:56:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh please, my tricksterness is only limited to when I am laying in a magic beanbag.</span><br />
[11:56:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: remember that beanbag?</span><br />
[11:56:55] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh riiiight.</span><br />
[11:59:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So um, Kimura.</span><br />
[11:59:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How much did you watch/play super mario 64.</span><br />

[12:00:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so you know that one section that leads to the door submerged in the water outside of the castle?</span><br />
[12:00:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In peaches castle?</span><br />
[12:00:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the basement area?</span><br />

[12:01:44] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...why?</span><br />
[12:01:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If I fell in there... /I/ wouldn't come back.</span><br />
[12:02:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh shit</span><br />
[12:02:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think that details enough about what is leaking into that area.</span><br />
[12:03:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Have you seen the... fourth episode of stargate atlantis?</span><br />
[12:03:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was titled "Thirty-Eight Minutes"</span><br />
[12:05:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just... replace the gate and the puddle jumper with two other things and it seems to fit perfectly.</span><br />
[12:06:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...not sure if I want to know how that analogy works in this case.</span><br />
[12:07:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, I think the magicant is... slowly sinking.</span><br />
[12:07:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, weirdness I just realized. we were talking about transhumanism earlier, and right now a cyberman episode is on ("Nightmare in Silver", to be specific)</span><br />
[12:08:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........sinking into where?</span><br />
[12:09:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Remember how I welded that door since it lead into the blue door?</span><br />
[12:09:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: blue hole*</span><br />

[12:11:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: aaaaaand since the Magicant isn't technically local to a specific session........</span><br />
[12:14:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its even more important that we destroy the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
[12:17:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. if we don't, it'll start eating sessions via the magicant before it even gets out to them on this side.</span><br />
[12:19:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah. Plus, it might... oh dear.</span><br />
[12:19:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Nevermind.</span><br />

[12:35:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A Flaming Angel, a Fire/Fairy type would likely a legendary.</span><br />

[12:36:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: heh. The Name of the Doctor is on right now, and this first part with the "conference call" is /totally/ a freakin' dreambubble.</span><br />
[12:38:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hmm, maybe I should fill out the fairy type with fakemon...</span><br />
[12:45:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fairy/Dragon is gonna be a Helium Dragon that evolves into a Balloon Animal Eastern style dragon.</span><br />
[12:46:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Fire/Fairy is going to be A legendary angel pokemon...</span><br />
[12:46:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While Fairy/Dark could be some sort of... fallen angel.</span><br />

[12:51:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know a Poison/Fairy pokemon will have to know Draining Kiss.</span><br />
[12:53:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Fire/Fairy Legendary would be a powerful pokemon, with high special attack and normal attack, but not much to defense.</span><br />
[12:53:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Where as the Dark/Fairy would be more defensive.</span><br />
[12:54:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps a Sun/Moon theme would be appropriate.</span><br />
[12:56:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It would be an excuse to give the Fire/Fairy Solar Beam and sunny day, where as the Dark/Fairy would get Moonlight and Moonblast.</span><br />
[12:57:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Bug, and Ghost...</span><br />

[02:44:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because right now with the new calculations it seems like everything is just gonna be thrown at the horror terrors.</span><br />

[02:46:17] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because it seems like one way or another you've been finding some threat or other, in the worst case /making/ it, since Chronos' defeat.</span><br />
[02:46:38] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The bull in the Magicant with Mewtwo. Now some apocalyptic scenerio with the planets using real-world physics.</span><br />
[02:46:50] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What have I said about applying those to the Medium? Or the game in general?</span><br />

[02:53:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically I found a section of the magicant that seems to make a holodeck from videogames, and I think Mewtwo got out.</span><br />
[02:53:57] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: apparently, FL thinks a Mewtwo escaped from Pokemon Red and he thinks catching him in a masterball is going to solve it ➜</span><br />

[02:57:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ripping a hole through the metal casing.</span><br />
