<span style="color:#8c8c8c">CDM: The Tower of Ash is a strange and unworldly place, seemingly a twisting pillar of billowing smoke, yet still solid for the most part. Within are scores of rooms or chambers, each a shadow of the places most favored by the restless dead that haunt the place. These strange chambers are not exact copies, but their distorted, surrealistic impressions.  Ascending the tower is arduous, with the chambers </span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">overlapping in spots, forming haphazard paths that heroes could follow to clamber up the “tower”. Additionally, some natural rifts or thin spots within the smoke form navigable chimneys.  Within the tower, everything but the rejected sacrifices is made of ash and soot, even if it appears otherwise. Windows open to unknown vistas of smoke and ash, translucent and impassable. The walls and floors are soli</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">almost as ash turned to stone, but not too solid for the heroes to dig hand and foot holds in the material.  What doors and shutters may be found within are shaped from ash as well, but of a normal ashy look and texture. They can be quickly passed through with little discomfort, the ash simply staying in the door frame, held as if by fields of power.  Walls may be torn down with great effort, but the doors</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  walks over to them, fur messed up a bit from the crash but otherwise okay --</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">remain open, not to be seen through or secured in any way.  As the tower’s undead guardians approach, the cold, hard ashes of the walls and floors will grow warm, with embers sparking to life again, restored by the suffering of the Unworthy Dead. The more powerful spirits may make their chambers uncomfortable indeed.  In the presence of the undead, walls and furnishings damaged by the living slowly return</span><br />
<span style="color:#8c8c8c">their former shape. Handholds, holes, or other changes gradually evaporate as the chambers of the dead restore themselves.</span><br />
