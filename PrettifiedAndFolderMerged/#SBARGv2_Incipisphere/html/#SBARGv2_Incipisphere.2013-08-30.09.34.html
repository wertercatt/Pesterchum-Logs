<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, it's supposed to screw things up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: It primarily turns pumpkins into energy, but as of late it appears Chronos has been altering it to do much more than that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: probably a loser</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm. so I should still look for where Cetus ran off to (Crump said she's in The Underwhere???), but just don't actually tier until titles are re-fixed</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what if we travel into the future past when we fix it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: The only problem I've been able to discern so far is the nulling of quest beds and crypts due to this "glitch" affecting players directly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ..can we even τravel τhrough τime</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: SE was able to do it</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: I do not expect current time players to have the knowledge nor ability to affectively use their new powers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Too late.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and you know, technically we are traveling through time at the speed of one second per second.</span><br />

<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: ......wait</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: less than really</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: he had lived many many days in the space of less than a day as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: well yeah. but one has to do it all and not die once</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So we won't be able to use our new powers effectively even after having shit explained to us and whatnot by other Players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: probably not</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what</span><br />
<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: Correct, AG. Speaking with another player may merely make the title easier to work with, but since these titles were never meant to be yours, you will not have the talent to work with them properly.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait, when was that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ash has FS' Cap of Darkness. She used it during the Siren dungeon to phase out like me in order to do the maze-game.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Player [Not-Void] + Item [Void] = …?</span><br />

<span style="color:#00ff00">CFO: I suppose there's bound to be a few spots where such things like that could have happened. But now that classes and aspects are fixed (for the most part), things like that should not happen anymore.</span><br />
