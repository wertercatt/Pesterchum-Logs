[09:22:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I won't.</span><br />
[09:22:47] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … so will you teach me how to make magic liquid fire and suns?</span><br />
[09:23:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well... thats kinda the outside part of a sun...</span><br />
[09:23:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I can teach you that... but the heart of a sun... thats too dangerous.</span><br />
[09:23:46] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't be silly, it's one of the last things a red mage learns.</span><br />
[09:24:05] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like black mages don't get to use the dimension circles proper.</span><br />
[09:24:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and does a red mage learn to know when to /stop/ before that?</span><br />
[09:24:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey! Discipline is a very important part of mage training!</span><br />
[09:24:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Burn one person you loved to a charred, smoking corpse, and you're pretty much guaranteed to never do it again!</span><br />
[09:25:04] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...</span><br />
[09:25:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...and what if you accidently burn a city?</span><br />

[09:25:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, don't worry. Usually we have our powers under control by the time we're like, nine.</span><br />
[09:26:02] <span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: yeah im just going to keep backing up</span><br />
[09:26:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not a red mage... I don't know how you were taught this.</span><br />
[09:26:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: infact, I would say this would be a rather different method than what a red mage would use...</span><br />
[09:26:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if I knew anything at all...</span><br />
[09:27:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It just seems...</span><br />
[09:27:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this isn't just normal fire manipulation...</span><br />
[09:27:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this leads further on a cosmic scale...</span><br />
[09:27:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Well, I woke up one day with my bed on fire, and then Father apprenticed me to Master Oshin. It's about that simple.</span><br />

[09:29:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
[09:29:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Normally, there are 3 states of matter.</span><br />

[09:29:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, there is a fourth.</span><br />
[09:29:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /Plasma/</span><br />
[09:29:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is like... an ionized gas.</span><br />
[09:30:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: everything in the universe is made out of... little circles.</span><br />
[09:30:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, if I ran an electrical charge through water, a liquid, I could seperate it into two gasses...</span><br />
[09:30:51] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: circles? huh... interesting...</span><br />
[09:31:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: See, these circles bind together to make the objects we know.</span><br />
[09:32:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plasma is when you bounce even tinyer circles off and onto those circles.</span><br />
[09:32:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: its an Ionized gas...</span><br />
[09:33:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: where electricity is flowing through it... however, heat is also required...</span><br />
[09:33:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: otherwise, the circles can't move fast enough to become like that.</span><br />
[09:34:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: these circles are made up of even tiner circles, which move so fast they basically are everywhere around that circle...</span><br />
[09:35:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and those tiny tiny circles... are made up of tiny tiny tiny /tiny/ so tiny you couldn't even imagine, strings.</span><br />
[09:35:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that are literally the thinest thing possible...</span><br />
[09:36:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they are one dimentional... and yet, go into 11 different dimentions...</span><br />
[09:36:24] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which ones?</span><br />
[09:36:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: for example, you could say this sphere right here is three dimentional...</span><br />
[09:36:40] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT frozenLake <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL]</span>  points at the plasma ball --</span><br />
[09:36:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and text on a piece of paper would be two...</span><br />
[09:37:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: those are /spacial/ dimentions... not alternate universes like you know of.</span><br />
[09:37:22] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh.</span><br />
[09:37:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: strings would be like a straight line... with only length, no width or height...</span><br />
[09:38:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah...</span><br />
[09:38:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: at such a small level... things get... weird.</span><br />
[09:38:26] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how do you get... eight more, though?</span><br />
[09:39:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...imagine branching a line off of a straight line... turning one dimention into two... then branching off of the paper into the air to make three...</span><br />
[09:39:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: going further would be branching past the spacetime we exist in...</span><br />
[09:40:11] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the /way/ those dimentions are also control the laws of physics and the conditions in universes...</span><br />
