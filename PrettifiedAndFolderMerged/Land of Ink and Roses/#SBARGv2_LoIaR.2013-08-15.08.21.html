<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT marshmallowVirologist <span style="color:#dba521">[CMV]</span>  walks in, heading to the Bacafe as per the usual. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is still sitting on the couch in front of the tv, nothing's on the tv at the moment --</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: hey, my favorite channel!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sleep okay last night? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: oh, yeah definitely! thanks so much for asking. how'd you sleep?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: in front of the tv?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was, okay, I guess. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: started doing some research at the Derse library ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: ooh, on what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: trying to find some info about the pre-reset session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so far haven't find anything really. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *found ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: that's cool work! not many people would do that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I actually got the idea from a friend of mine. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: apparently she was able to figure out her old classpect title. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: old? they change?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: apparently. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: oh shoot that makes everything so confusing!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, Charles's prereset self has lord of blood while his current self has rogue of heart. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i'm apparently a something of blood! er...think it starts with a p.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though I'm kinda more interested in the other things that apparently happened during that session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: what happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've heard from some of my contacts that there's a really large possiblity that Chronos was present in that session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: still not sure who chronos is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wait a minute, really? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: yeah, i've been reaaaally out of the loop for like, ever!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: welp, let me fill you in. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: first of all, Chronos was actually the guy that got us to start this session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but we didn't know who he was back then ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because he referred to himself as "the guardian" ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so when we finally got to enter this wretched game, it turned out that the gates were messed up. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and we had to wait like, forever for them to get fixed, one by one. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some kid I used to know tried to work around the gates with a rocketscythe, but Chronos felt lie being a jerk and took that away from him. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *like ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so for a while we were beingh led around blindly by this guy ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and helping him hack into stuff ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I can't believe how stupid we were. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, I legit thought this hacking was going to helpfix the session. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but it wound up doing the exact opposite. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: well, the past is the past! at least you have those mistakes under your belt for next time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: but at least you're like, all to blame instead of just one of you. that's kind of nice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i...i'm sorry. </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eventually though, he decided that he finally had our trust at a high enough level to ask for our sprites. Most people complied, some out right refused. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was going to refuse, but I felt like I needed answers. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I sent tigerplushsprite in with a webcam. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...he never came back. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: o-oh..</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it was at that point that he spritesploded most of the sprites that were sent in and flew the heck out of the driver's seat, leaving us all alone with no guardian. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: of course, we were able to locate the real one, Flock Ornis, but still. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: this chronos guy sounds kind of like a huge dick.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and all of those gates he had fixed? he blew them up again. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so here we are, having to deal with that thing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs, staring at the floor --</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i'm sorry about tiger plush sprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i'd be really lost without my sprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... my sprite taught me how to handle living on lohan. The first few weeks with him was retty much boot camp, but I'm grateful for it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *pretty ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: you can get by without him now, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, but it still gets lonely sometimes. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the consorts on my land are kinda out of the way and all I have at home is a kitten. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: oh. well i'm sure tigerplush is happy that you're getting by! man i'd be super happy if i were your sprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...I guess. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: and hey you could always get some friends to come hang out on your planet!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: when they're not busy with constant dungeon crawls. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i'm sure it'll settle down. but hey, when one door closes! with all these dungeon crawls, maybe you could not uhm...feel sidelined?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda hard to control something like that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: oh. well i'm sorry then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...thank you for taking your time to talk with me. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: huh? oh, i just really like hearing people talk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: i'm sorry, i'm just being dumb. </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...it's okay. it's not dumb at all though. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: it's kind of dumb. not every problem needs to be solved, i should just listen more.</span><br />

<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: ooh. that is tempting! i didn't think anyone was alive at first!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there are, mostly. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: but...i don't know, they really scared me when a big crowd of them came here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: talking about hate relationships and...kiss me sis? and insults and madness and insanity and it was all rather scary.</span><br />
