[07:27:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But we wouldn't get much of an advantage on further AU's from that one.</span><br />
[07:28:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We could try Minecraft as an AU, but that would be... tricky.</span><br />
[07:29:04] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah... ➜</span><br />
[07:29:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since the end of the loop varies when it comes to Minecraft.</span><br />

[07:44:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we could start out with a Mario Kart AU, using the figure 8 track from Mario Kart DS. ➜</span><br />
[07:45:35] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the goal would be pretty easy: just make sure one of us gets 1st place after 3 laps. ➜</span><br />

[07:46:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay you have a point</span><br />
[07:47:30] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: we just have to remember not to take any weird detours. ➜</span><br />
[07:47:48] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (I'm sure you remember last time we all played mario kart) ➜</span><br />
[07:47:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (yeah)</span><br />
[07:49:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We should actually do the Mario Kart 7 stuff so we have a method of flight in the AUs.</span><br />
[07:49:55] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: never played that one.  ➜</span><br />
[07:49:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Since I can't exactly get powers to stay on reliably.</span><br />
[07:50:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, in 7, the karts have hanggliders on them.</span><br />
