[01:50:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Yo, kitty, we should talk.</span><br />
[01:50:13] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: About?</span><br />
[01:50:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: You keep hunting down birds, huh?</span><br />
[01:51:03] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: ...oh yeah!</span><br />
[01:51:35] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Annoying little bastards.</span><br />
[01:52:04] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Caw this, caw that, screech in my ears.</span><br />
[01:52:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: I knooow right? They're tasty, at least.</span><br />
[01:52:33] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: ...what?</span><br />
[01:52:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Haven't you ever tried eating one?</span><br />
[01:53:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Or wait, or are you too much a sprite to be eating?</span><br />
[01:53:20] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: No, not really.</span><br />
[01:53:29] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Do you have the code for some salt?</span><br />
[01:53:44] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: I asked FL and he wouldn't give it to me :&lt;</span><br />
[01:54:56] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Huh. Yeah, 0a1591q6.</span><br />
[01:54:56] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Those captchas are impossible to read!</span><br />
[01:55:00] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Thanks!</span><br />
[01:55:03] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: :3</span><br />
[01:55:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Also, kitty, why do you keep giving FL the dead birds?</span><br />
[01:55:17] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: He doesn't like 'em.</span><br />
[01:56:03] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: well I didn't think he would like it if I dropped them in that giant blender on his second floor.</span><br />
[01:56:21] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: I'm just cleaning up :&lt;</span><br />
[01:56:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Have you /tried/ eating them?</span><br />
[01:57:10] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: No, not really.</span><br />
[01:57:17] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: I might get bird flu or something!</span><br />
[01:57:57] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: You're a cat.</span><br />
[01:58:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: You don't get "bird flu".</span><br />
[01:58:32] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: I thought eating raw bird made you come down with bird flu!</span><br />
[01:58:44] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: It definitely doesn't.</span><br />
[01:58:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: It does make you less hungry.</span><br />
[02:00:24] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: ...Not really hungry to be honest.</span><br />
[02:00:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Killing birds to get rid of the annoyance is also a perfectly legitimate thing. Just watch out for the humans who look like birds.</span><br />
[02:01:02] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: So, did you just wanna talk about the bird thing?</span><br />
[02:01:07] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: There are a couple part-bird Players, just like we're part-cats.</span><br />
[02:01:10] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Wait, there are bird people?</span><br />
[02:01:18] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Yeah, two of 'em at current count.</span><br />
[02:01:33] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Is one of them the dude with the awesome fedora?</span><br />
[02:02:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: I'm not sure. They're pretty obviously bird people, though. It's kiiinda hard to miss the gigantic wings.</span><br />
[02:03:27] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Oh, okay!</span><br />
[02:03:44] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: I'll see about meeting them soon!</span><br />
[02:03:59] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: They can be annoying, but are friends.</span><br />
[02:04:06] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Thanks for the code!</span><br />
[02:04:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Anything else you wanted to talk about? I got nothin'.</span><br />
[02:04:20] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Oh, yeah!</span><br />
[02:04:32] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Where did Charles get those awesome PJs?</span><br />
[02:05:27] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: He advanced very far in the Game and got most if not all of his echeladder rungs, then died and had his corpse put on special bed.</span><br />
[02:05:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: When he came back to life, he had awesome PJs.</span><br />
[02:05:41] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Also he was a god.</span><br />
[02:09:37] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: ...okay, that sounds weird and complicated!</span><br />
[02:10:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: It is! It's also just Game mechanics.</span><br />
[02:10:49] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Yeah, to be honest, it kinda feels like spoilers.</span><br />
[02:11:09] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Eh. It's common knowledge here.</span><br />
[02:11:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Called god tiering.</span><br />
[02:11:24] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Seriously, the ultimate riddle is kinda bori- hmm?</span><br />
[02:11:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Hm?</span><br />
[02:12:06] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Why is it common knowledge?</span><br />
[02:12:25] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Does this have to do with this "homestuck" charles was always telling me to read?</span><br />
[02:12:31] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Most of us read Homestuck. Also, most of us here /are/ gods.</span><br />
[02:12:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Homestuck is a webcomic that talks about this Game.</span><br />
[02:12:44] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Oh!</span><br />
[02:12:56] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: That kinda makes sense!</span><br />
[02:13:11] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Like one of those "Lets Plays"!</span><br />
[02:13:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Yeah, basically. Homestuck is something of a Let's Play of this Game.</span><br />
[02:16:42] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Okay.</span><br />
[02:17:13] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: So, why did we do this here instead of on the memo?</span><br />
[02:17:54] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: I tend to message people directly when I want to talk to them one-on-one without necessarily anyone else interfering.</span><br />
[02:17:58] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: *shruuugs*</span><br />
[02:18:15] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Oh, okay.</span><br />
[02:18:24] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: I'm not really good at recaps is the thing.</span><br />
[02:18:39] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: So? You don't have to be.</span><br />
[02:18:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: Why would you need to be good at recaps? O.o</span><br />
[02:19:26] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Well, I guess Charles was gettng freaked out by the dead crows? And maybe I might need to explain this convo?</span><br />
[02:19:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: He was. And I don't think you need to explain this convo, dude.</span><br />
[02:20:02] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Oh, okay.</span><br />
[02:20:11] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: Is that because you are going to do it?</span><br />
[02:20:13] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: :3</span><br />
[02:20:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">AG: No, it's because it doesn't need to be explained.</span><br />
[02:20:33] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: ...k then.</span><br />
[02:20:48] <span style="color:#ffc080">DJ: ...bye?</span><br />
