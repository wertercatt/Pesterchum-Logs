<span style="color:#000080">BB: sorry i don't know what to say</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Perhaps machine placement plans?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: sure, what are your thoughts</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have a decent sized area in the back yard which could work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: cool, i have no backyard but something should fit on my pourch or in one of the rooms</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: You may want to talk to anodynified bout that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: cept he isn't on</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: yeah that's the problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: you should know my internet is a little sketchy and i am sorry if it cuts out unexpectedly and it looks like i am ditching our conversation</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: k</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I'm seeing who is likely to combine with us...</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: but most teams seem full.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: ok, well i am sure new people will be added</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Think you will be able to spare 2 grist for the prototype?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: pre entry, that it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: is*</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: of course</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Then it seems PGO sprite is a go!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Perfectly Generic Object, if your wondering.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: i like that idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: The only thing we can make without punching cards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: that or cruxite sprite.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: cruxite sprite probably isn't the best idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Who knows, we might start a meme!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Use game abstracts to prototype?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: but that becomes a really unhelpful sprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: only for t1.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have an urn with my grandpas ashes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: that would make a better sprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: So, CubeGrandpa?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: i like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: k</span><br />

<span style="color:#000080">BB: i am thinking things from my books and based on my posters</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I have a ton of video games...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">FL: And yugioh cards</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080">BB: what would you make first</span><br />
