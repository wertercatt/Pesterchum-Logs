<span style="color:#aa0000">CDS: hes not online though</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: take two screen shots with an adjustment of exactly 1 second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You should be able to make a line that shows the flight path</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and the speed its going</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: she barely knows how to fly the thing</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then take several and average it out</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i appreciate the effort, but i dont think its going to be that easy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...And warp an EMP infront of her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It doesn't need to be exact</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i understand his reasoning for /having/ it</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're putting yourself on worse terms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you dont bring it up as soon as you walk in</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you failed to show us that you trust us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: speaking of Death Lasers, if PK comes on, tell her I EMP'd the haywire one in orbit around LoCaL so it wouldn't destroy her land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and aren't you supposed to be a /Mage/ of Blood?</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((wouldn't it makes sense for your char to be able to mess up a player sheet?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I understand that you wish to be a leader sort. If you /really/ wanna. You gotta learn not to take personal matters into things. While I understand that AE was heckling you a fair bit, you drew yourself into that far to much. </span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: which is that /ds felt that he needed to have a death cannon pointed at the hq/</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what does that fucking say about us</span><br />
DS: we don't trust each other<br />

DS: and I'll openly admit that<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it's more like you have trust issues ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think thats really disturbing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: since you were the guy with the cannon in the first place ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: The fact that you are able to aquire death lasers and point it at HQ's very easilly? And thats bad?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how many people in this room are capable and have trust me with their lives in the past?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the blame cant be placed entirely on ds</span><br />
DS: yeah i have trust issues<br />
DS: I'm fucking paranoid<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: everybody rushes to blame ds's trust issues because we dont want to admit that /we made it difficult for him to trust us/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though it seems that it creates these stupid self-fulfilling prophesies ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay SL. let's play your angle for a second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: DS what is it that drove you to decide that was a good idea?</span><br />
DS: ummm<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Take your time. I want a thorough answer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont be scared to be honest either</span><br />
DS: the fact that at least two people in the room have expressed desire to kill me in the past?<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because im almost certainly going to white knight the hell out of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Would you kindly keep quiet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Where in the line of sense and logic does it lie to aim a large laser at a high center of players. Not only do you endanger yourself and others but you may force their hand, if they actually wished to kill you.</span><br />

DS: yeah, I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to give ADD kid the capability to make a death laser<br />
