<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, what is the most recent map of the hotel?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Actually... Mountains tend to be inactive volcanos...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets have one of the Mountains erupt!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ....FL, really? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just wanted to see how everyone would react to an eruption. or an earthquake. or a tornado. or another natural disaster.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I know!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ALIEN INVASION</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: . . . . . . . . </span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: how would that make sense though?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what reason would aliens find to invade anyways? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like, aliens from literally nowhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, Aliens that flicker between being robots and computer data!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O????? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Duo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ...maybe I could bring in one of my ΘCs</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...nevermind, you don't get it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll explain it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: In the original megaman games, Duo was a robot. In battle network 4, he was an AI. On a meteor.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Both were made to hunt down evil energy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, the issue is, that the only difference between the orignal series and battle network was that in Battle Network, Hikari's Network Research was sponsered, rather than Wily's Robot Research.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that doesn't explain Duo.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right so, now to discuss /actual plans/ to deal with the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, what does everyone here know about Hawking radiation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nope ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: fat lotta nothin</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, Hawking Radiation is energy that somehow miracrulously escapes from a black hole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It is why Microscopic blackholes tend to fade.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It was actually showcased in Problem Sleuth with the angels.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CTT</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, if we can contain the blue hole in a field of fast time, making sure light and matter can't get in...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It /might/ be possible to let Hawking Radiation destroy the <span style="color:#0000ff">Blue Hole</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: "making sure light and matter can't get in" is an action that is easier said then done</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Ornis seems to think FI and SF have it covered.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why can't we just let them enact their plan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because the plan might backfire horribly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we might need a backup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Think about it. The fate of the session resting on two players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seems a bit suspicious, if you ask me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Seems like a typical RPG trope, to me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Either way, it was foreshadowed in their Denizen choices.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, but considering how overused that trope is, it might get inverted.</span><br />
