[09:59:31] DS: it seemed like a good idea at the time<br />
[09:59:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was when I passed out...</span><br />
[10:00:01] DS: Plus we used the apples to power the machine!<br />

[10:00:22] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...what?...</span><br />

[10:00:57] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...uuuhh...</span><br />
[10:01:18] DS: the machina does more than switch our classes. it had files on all of us<br />
[10:01:33] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...But I thought it exploded?...</span><br />
[10:01:49] DS: it did<br />
[10:02:12] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Did anyone get a look at those files before it blew up?...</span><br />
[10:02:12] DS: which was kind of dissapointing<br />
[10:02:18] yes<br />
[10:02:28] we looked a seth's<br />
[10:02:48] DS: it said hes corrupted.<br />
[10:05:39] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Well, that's kind of obvious, what with him turning into Chronos eventually, right?...</span><br />
[10:06:25] DS: Yes. the dual aspects corrupted him<br />
[10:07:21] DS: im still trying to piece together the lore, but i think that seth is post scratch cronos<br />
[10:07:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ugh</span><br />
[10:07:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you still don't get it</span><br />

[10:09:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If you trust FLord and what he said the horrorterrors said.</span><br />
[10:09:54] DS: could you please elaborate, ive never heard this story<br />
[10:11:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, so back in the prescratch session, horror terrors stated that Chronos was created in the session we would create, and he killed everyone there when they tried to convince him to go through the door, which would apparently cause him to lose his powers.</span><br />
[10:11:12] DS: and i wouldnt trust FLord<br />
[10:11:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this is why we scratched, but stable timeloops and what not</span><br />
[10:12:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: we scratched to attempt to prevent his creation, but it lead to this... and well, fuck.</span><br />
[10:12:31] DS: why would they scratch a completed session?<br />
[10:12:47] DS: ah<br />
[10:12:54] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...huh...</span><br />
[10:13:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: of course, the scratch created /this/ session... so...</span><br />
[10:13:48] DS: so instead of being reset, he was trasported his true session and given another aspect?<br />
[10:13:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no</span><br />
[10:14:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: this session is his birthplace</span><br />
[10:14:21] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: .......</span><br />
[10:14:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and he tricked our last first guardian into letting him into /that/ session.</span><br />
[10:14:31] DS: so how did he get to the pre-scratch session?<br />
[10:14:46] DS: how?<br />
[10:14:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I assume the Jaspers method</span><br />
[10:15:22] DS: our first guardian? ornis?<br />
[10:15:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, our last one.</span><br />
[10:15:41] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Apparently guardians change through scratches</span><br />
[10:15:42] DS: who?<br />
