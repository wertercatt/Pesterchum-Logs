[07:40:54] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: For help and stuff? :&gt;</span><br />
[07:41:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: who wants some amber grist?</span><br />
[07:41:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have managed to create an amber gem that might be magic, but its alot easier to give then just using grist torrent</span><br />
[07:41:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus, as it was created by alchemy, you don't need to use boons to recycle it.</span><br />
[07:42:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its worth about 1m Amber.</span><br />
[07:42:36] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Hm... :&gt;</span><br />
[07:42:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wonder if I could make others that are similar?</span><br />
[07:43:03] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Maybe you can! :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:11] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: You can be a grist donation pool :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:16] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: People come in who really need grist :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:19] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And you open your doors :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:21] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And I can be :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, this would be faster than grist torrent.</span><br />
[07:43:26] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: In my hot tub :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:28] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: relaxing :&gt;</span><br />
[07:43:42] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I will be a helpful player by not helping anyone out :&gt;</span><br />

[07:44:11] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: isn't gristtorrent the only feasible method of grist transfer once it's collected though?</span><br />
[07:44:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, alchemized items can be recycled for free</span><br />
[07:45:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: using the SBURB Server</span><br />
[07:45:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, good point...</span><br />
[07:45:55] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: What about the rest of y'all? :&gt;</span><br />
[07:46:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The issue with GristTorrent is that it is /slow/</span><br />
[07:46:15] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Ask not what your...uhh... :&gt;</span><br />
[07:46:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I suppose I might also be able to make some tiny, alterniabound style sprites.</span><br />
[07:46:35] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: your....something...can do for you...but what you can do for someone else :&gt;</span><br />
[07:47:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I can gank your shit.</span><br />

[07:47:47] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Have you thought of :&gt;</span><br />
[07:47:50] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Trying to steal from Chronos :&gt;</span><br />
[07:47:52] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: ??? :&gt;</span><br />
[07:47:57] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:48:00] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Young Chronos, yes.</span><br />
[07:48:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think that counts as /suicide/</span><br />
[07:48:11] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Checked that off my bucket list a while back.</span><br />
[07:48:36] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: FL, suicide, maybe. But you forget, I had a 100% death rate and I survived by sheer luck. :&gt;</span><br />
[07:48:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Other'n that, I have considered stealing things from doubletier!Chronos before, yus :3</span><br />
[07:48:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, Seth's old grist torrent account is almost empty...</span><br />
[07:49:04] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: The thing I'm getting at is :&gt;</span><br />
[07:49:07] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I think it's time to get serious :&gt;</span><br />
[07:49:10] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Almost? Check again.</span><br />
[07:49:10] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: We know what we need to do :&gt;</span><br />
[07:49:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...okay, it /is/ empty</span><br />
[07:49:20] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: We know who our enemy is :&gt;</span><br />

[07:49:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: unless my grist torrent is glitching</span><br />
[07:49:44] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Instead of lollygagging and being like "well, we have no idea what to do" or "he's too powerful" :&gt;</span><br />
[07:49:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: I say :&gt;</span><br />
[07:49:46] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: We actually plan shit :&gt;</span><br />
[07:49:50] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No, it's empty :3</span><br />

[07:51:10] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ^</span><br />
[07:51:21] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Think of it like having unlimited lives in a video game :&gt;</span><br />
[07:51:22] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: or :&gt;</span><br />
[07:51:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
[07:51:30] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Has anyone played "I wanna be the guy"? :&gt;</span><br />
[07:51:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: EP is Sudokucidal</span><br />

[07:54:59] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: And not be bothered :&gt;</span><br />

[07:56:00] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Is that fair? :&gt;</span><br />
[07:56:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a plan in place for handling him.</span><br />
[07:56:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That he cannot counter.</span><br />
[07:56:25] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Good. Please do tell. :&gt;</span><br />
[07:56:43] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT existentialPenguin <span style="color:#133295">[CEP]</span>  is all ears --</span><br />

[07:57:03] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Yes :&gt;</span><br />

[07:58:56] <span style="color:#133295">CEP: Do we have access to the grid? :&gt;</span><br />

[08:00:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: As space is not just teleporting.</span><br />
[08:01:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, you can still port OUT, to some extent, you just can't port IN.</span><br />
[08:01:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: what I was saying was, someone would have to be bait and FLY ALL THE WAY THERE MANUALLY</span><br />
