<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: I'm probably wrong, however.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: She DID mention when we talked about cronos that fighting a 2 apsect player was quaint, or something...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some folks think it might be breath ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Somebody said 'What' like 'What' was literally the aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Gotta get going. later. CP, make sure to pass on this info if anyone else fights her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think it might be Breath because she seemed pretty attached to it the first time we met her.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Blood?</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Life to boost.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yeah I could see that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Blood player who stole other aspects, maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We could check the Library for the 3rd time in a row</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: This place where we talked to a hologram of a denizen or something and he told us a bedtime story.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we could probably check the place out again...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean granted it was a bedtime story about somebody who wanted to destroy a universe so I wouldn't tell my kids it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Yaldabaoth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Yaldabaoth, apparently. according to the stream, the session was a six-"player" Dead Session because they all entered from the same house.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I just called it "Holobaoth" because it's definitely not alive</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Apparently only she ended up making it to the lair or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Maybe she just had friends over and thought they were playing fuckin Doom or something.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh hi to you too I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I remember something or other about the giant lizard snake corpse thing in the center of the planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Something like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I said Hi</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or hey</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It played into my land lore and a little more... Honestly I don't know for sure, whether it was my Denizen, /one/ of my Denizens, just a fixture in the history, or what exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That lore said it was responsible for creating the planet and for later down the line wrecking it. Apparently it died at some point before I even made it there, for Dae to end up using as robot material.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And after the fight he put it back in the core where its body broke down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And usually that'd be enough but... It hadn't actually died, s'much as gone into some sort of hibernation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CFI: wtf</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ahahahaha. Never accuse Sburb of having a straightforward mythology, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It's spirit, I guess you could call it its heart, persisted on and raised trouble but, you guys weren't really around for that. No big deal I took care of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: And uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: to answer the question</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It was my kinda-sorta-maybe Denizen/Bonus Boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I was just trying to figure out if he was a dick or not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mine was kind of a dick. But then it wasn't even so much as.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It just operated on a wholely different moral wavelength, it had no real concept of right and wrong just its weird sense of godly duty and dogmatic standards.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That sounds about like what me and Isaac saw</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Funny that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: At the very least it meant I could actually reason with it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Nothin.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Apparently the baddy's denizen was Yaldabaoth so it makes her tougher or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Or means she means business</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh yeah, I never had to kill my denizen either. mostly because the Grist Hoard was stolen and we /liquified/ the baddies who stole it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: welp I killed the memo again</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm mildly busy.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but I was watching nearby, and would have intervened if it went too far.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: That alone tells me it wasn't anything super entertaining.</span><br />
