AG: I, uh. Can't look at most of it.<br />
SA: The entire ARG I just...<br />
SA: on one hand that was literally how I grew the hell up?<br />
SA: and on the other why did it take RPing a hellhole of a game for four months to get me to learn<br />
AG: … I liked the beginning. And then, y'know… Dynast. Even though I /was/ Dynast for a while thanks to David's fucking Internet...<br />
