<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: do you guys remember when FL had that thing that vaguely mentione angels and then everyone was afraid of it going the scode route with angeldarkness?

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi there NN ➜</span><br />
I have risen from the depths of Florida, but only partially.<br />
Just here to tell the anecdote of my near death<br />
So we were driving on the highway then suddenly<br />
Engine break<br />
Coasted over to the right side of the road<br />
Waited 3 hours<br />
In the dark<br />
On a busy highwqay<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: whoa crud ➜</span><br />
With semitrucks going by way too frequently<br />
Fast<br />
And close<br />
Eventually the police, a tow truck, and a taxi came out<br />
Because it took a lot of people to move 10 passengers and a 12 passenger van<br />
(3 in tow truck; 1 in police car; rest in taxi)<br />
And now we have to wait for Ford to fix the thing<br />
Which they won't do on Sunday<br />
