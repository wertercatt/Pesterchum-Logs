<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: as a seer of mind i can already see some of the outcomes of different choices and i have a good grip on logic</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: but that's after doing a lot of levelling up and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...anyway...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm going to head off to bed...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Maid, Seer, Mage, Knight, Thief, Rogue, Sylph, Prince, Bard, Heir</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: see you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...stay safe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Lord, Muse(master classes)</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and two others I can't seem to recall</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: witch is another</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and page</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFF</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: also as a note master classes are extremely powerful and are very rarely assigned to anyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i don't think there's any in this session</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Then why have them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they're for special cases i think</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: A two player session will have them</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: they're for two-player sessions</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: A two player session is ABSOLUTELY DEAD</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: In addition a simple questbed death isn't all there is</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, a SINGLEPLAYER session is totally dead</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: But wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: The master classes are in fact not involved in this session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: two-player is theoretically possible, and is the absolute minimum for a "normal" session type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I thought that it was two players</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: Just putting that out there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: because they shared a body?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Master classes are incredibely potent</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: two players can work as the minimum but if they aren't space and time players respectively their session is doomed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and in the wrong hands(the wrong hands that DO CLEARLY exist) they can cause untold amountso f destruction</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Huh, that's pretty neat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What's a Bard do?</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: less active</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: less doing things actively</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and more influencing them??</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: it can be difficult to explain</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: a bard destroys through [or invites the destruction of] their aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Princes and bards are a pair</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Princes destroy through their aspect or cause destruction through it</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: That sounds cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: while bards do what SE said</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It may be cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but its also dangerous as hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: as I said, a prominant bard killed most of his friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they have a really weird costume as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and the prince of their session destroyed their last hope</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: as well as a player</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Ouch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: wasn't it actually two but one came back to life through shenanigans?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: The Prince of Hope is an absolute monstrosity</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and then killed him</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and if PKing in this game weren't murder</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I would destroy them as soon as physically possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: This game is confusing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you'll get used to it</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Hopefully. </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and you'll pull some crazy title shit as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: in my first hour here I completed my entire planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Think i'll head to my land...let Vivian sleep..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: by using a massive supply of alternate mes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: and cool</span><br />

<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I'll explore adn get back to you all on what my stuff is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: We're eager to see what you are capable of</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I'm curious too.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah your title is essential is a sort of subplot way to most of your time in the session</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: With the monstrosity currenetely overrunning our game</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: you'll become quite aquainted with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What monstrosity?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: Chronos</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I'm not going to get too much into it with TT around</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but he's horrible</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: He like a villan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: A thing not even meant to be in the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: but yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: a villian</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: While the Black Queen and King are monstrosities</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: It is essentially</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: the secret boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: like the boss beyond the boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: the boss far harder than the final boss</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CAC: I gtg</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: theyre the friendly npcs on your land</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they can offer you information on the game and your title too</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they aren't always that smart though</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Okay, after I make this guitar, i'll go look for one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: also they aren't always that friendly</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: but at least they dont kill you</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Right..what do they look like?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: depends on the land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they tend to be amphibians or reptiles</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they can be anything though really</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah it really depends on the land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: they're almost always some kind of animal though. I seem to be the exception for some reason...</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: for example i have tortoises</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: man, if I had rolled wolves as my consorts like DS did, that would've been just so... whoa...</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: well ghost tortoises but still</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: (( What would Consorts for Wrath and GEms be like? xD ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: instead, I got Russian-accented drunk rocket scientists that explode.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ((maybe you could look up some sort of animal that has relevance to gems?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: (( Kay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ((or a violent/angry animal))</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: ((yes that sounds excellent))</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: (( Hell yes. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Aright, I made this awesom guitar, gonna look for some consorts.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: have fun consort-hunting</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Will do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Man these big gems are everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: if you want you can look at the things they sell and it would probably be in your interest to buy some fraymotifs</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: though they're very very expensive</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: fraymotifs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they're music-related boosts that help your attacks</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: or defenses against foes</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: some can be used with other players</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What foes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: underlings usually</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: but you can use them against virtually anyone</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What kind of underlings?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: imps, ogres, liches, the usual</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I'm not seeing any of those around here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: huh</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i'm not sure why that's up</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: maybe they're just somewhere else</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: or attacking consorts or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Should I be looking for them too?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you don't really need to go looking for them</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they come and find you usually</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they give grist when you defeat them though</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Oh. That's good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: so you can</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: also fraymotifs are aspect based</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: in the store you should get at least some hints on your aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Kay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: the names tend to be related</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What's your fraymotifs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i haven't found them all yet because the ones in the shops change every time i visit</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: but one's logical ligature, a solo mind motif that boosts your abilities to see the results of choices</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Cool.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: another's predisponency's waltz, a mind/light combo that allows them to have insights regarding the best choice of action</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: especially if they're seers, which is pretty good for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and there's a couple others i can't remember too well</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What's yours?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what do you mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Your class and Aspect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i'm a seer of mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What you do?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: seers of mind can see the results of choices and know timeline stuff fairly well from that</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and they have a very good handle on logic</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: So, your smart?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: PP is basically Terezi without the blindness and JUST1C3 obsession :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i'm not one hundred percent sure to be honest</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i'm not fully realised</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i am pretty smart</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What should I say when I find a consort?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: just say hi or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they tend to regard players as idols on their planets</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they respect them a lot usually</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: well i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they also worship frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Frogs?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and plus they have tales of legend about the players because usually they're destined to save their land</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: long story short universes are frogs</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: CG, have you even read Homestuck all the way through?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i don't understand it too well</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: (( Icly, no. OOCly, yes. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: space players breed the frogs to make a new universe so they're the experts</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Sounds hard.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: it's pretty complicated but they're really good at it</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they understand it a lot better than everyone else</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: it's a good thing they're doing it i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Hey, I think I see something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: does it look like a consort?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: It's some sort of... purple dragon. It's hitting a big ass ruby with a pickaxe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: sounds like a consort</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Sweet, i'll go and as-</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Wait a minute.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: none of the underlings or enemies look like dragons to the best of my knowledge</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what's up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Something is coming up behind the dragon.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what's it look like</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: It's black and is wearing a stupid outfit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: it's an underling</span><br />

<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they actively destroy their aspect or through their aspect i think</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: counterpart to bards</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Sounds cool, gonna ask him about the other half.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they can be dangerous as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Instead of being forward, Chief says I need to go on a journey to discover it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: okay then</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: consorts can be pretty mysterious and vague</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: usually not with titles thougj</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: *though</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: He says there are some ruins north of here that hold my Aspect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you should take his advice and go there</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: But he says that it's full of those imps.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: actually on second though</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: *thought</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you should alchemise more weapons/better weapons</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: or maybe train a bit</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: That other guy gave me a good guitar though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: if it's important it'll probably be dangerous</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah id go with possibly training before going there</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Let me ask Chief about some help before I go on my 'journey'.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that's a good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: He says he will allow me to trian with his people.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and that's an even better one</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i'm not sure how good consorts are at fighting</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: but this could help you a lot</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Hopefully, I start my training now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you should ask about how long you'll be training just in case</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Aright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: like if you train for more than a month it might be excessive</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: his advice is still important though</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: He says it will only take a day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: go for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that's shortish but also will probably be good for you</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Aright. he says I should go meet his people, which i'm doing now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMO</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: are the consorts friendly?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: They seem happy to see me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that's a good sign</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: well usually</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they could secretly be excited to eat you but that's unlikely</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Oh God.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what happened?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#6507ff">CURRENT timeTravlur [CTT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Nothing, the thought of being eaten by small, purple, native american dragons got the worst mental image for me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: sorry for causing said imagery</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: You good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: how is your training session with the consorts going by the way</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I'm sitting around a fireplace with them, discussing stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: They appairently use the gems around here for... sacrafices.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: how do you sacrifice a gem?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: do they burn or melt or what</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Throw it in the firepit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: don't gems have unreasonably high melting/burning temperatures though</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Maybe they don't know that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: alright then</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: what're you talking about with them</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: They are talking about Gems, Imps giving them trouble, and collecting gems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they seem to have a fixation on gems</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I could help them get some gems, they're pickaxes don't seem great.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: helping consorts is also pretty good because they can reward you with stuff sometimes</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Now i'm interested.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: plus you might get some gems out of it and they're great for weapons</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: they're really durable and strong</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Maybe I could go Minecraft and make a diamond sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Or guitar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: plus they'd look really cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: A solid diamond guitar, man that be awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: it could also dazzle the underlings with its light-refracting skills</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: They would like to have me help them. Three dragons will bring me to a gem and i'll help get it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: sweet</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: will they give you anything in return?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: A good portions of the gems we collect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that's good</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you should definitely help them</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I'm starting to like these dragon guys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: consorts that give you stuff are the best consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: that and they are funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: funny purple native american dragons</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFS</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: that sounds cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it does, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Me and three dragons are harvesting gems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yep that's pretty cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: do they have mines for gems?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: where do they find them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I don't know. Most of the gem sI see are just big and on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: I see a bunch of big diamonds and other gems.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: it's kind of weird to think about</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: all this would be worth so much on earth</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: but now there's huge gems lying on the ground and we're just like 'eh'</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: 'sounds about right'</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: The dragons seem to like them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMH</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: consorts generally like their lands</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Damn, I should of made some sort of backpack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: can't you use your sylladex to carry the gems?</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Not for me, for the dragons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you probably should have then</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: oh well</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i don't think you would have forseen gem-obsessed dragons</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Yeeeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: maybe you can make a kind of carrying device?</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: like with whatever's in your sylladex</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: or just using your shirt by turning up the edge works</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: and using it like a pouch</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: But I like this shirt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: you can wash your shirt later probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Okay..</span><br />
<span style="color:#33cccc">CPP: i don't think gems would be too bad for it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so anyway, g'night and good luck with stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#dcb431">CCG: Yeah. We got some gems, my guitar is doing better then they're picks.</span><br />
