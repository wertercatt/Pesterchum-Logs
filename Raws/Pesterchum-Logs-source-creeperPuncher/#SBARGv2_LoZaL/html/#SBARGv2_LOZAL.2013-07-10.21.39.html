<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, this is cool. but, uh, you sure we're safe up here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Relax. Everything is fine. Those look like meteors, but they'll disintergrate into grist the second they touch anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ah, so it is a special effect. I kinda figured as much...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  nervously looks up at the FALLING DEATH STARS OF DOOM that actually aren't even deudly --</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well... all I can say is, make sure that when you /have to/ fight again, that you /can/ fight again. in other words, at least do a bit of practice once in a while</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: True enough, CP...</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure... you said it's good for future-tech, so I might experiment with the codes I got from The Grid the other day...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or I might just release it into the session's Grist Gutter and see if anyone else can make stuff with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: Cool. I could tinker around, if you need it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: I kinda wanna come back, but I don't wanna get in the way or upset anyone. Plus, Brucebatsprite would have a fit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Oh, don't worry! You won't upset anyone from coming back. Heck, I think it'll make everyone a bit happier.</span><br />

<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: "Waaa</span><br />
<span style="color:#fe481a">CPO: ?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: When it comes to the training... Why not have other players spar with PO? Everyone has a diffrent fighting style, and a varity is good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: That way, PO can also travel to other lands, and still has a lot of new training oppertunites, imps and such aside.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's true, actually. the more experiences he has, the better a fighter he can become.</span><br />
