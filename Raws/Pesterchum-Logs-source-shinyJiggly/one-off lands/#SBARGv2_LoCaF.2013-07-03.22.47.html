<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  what are the ingredients of the potion? --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT purpleTiger <span style="color:#8700cb">[CPT]</span>  stares down at the bowl, picking up a strawberry and eating it. It also looks like there's tablets of asprin at the bottom --</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: huh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT purpleTiger <span style="color:#8700cb">[CPT]</span>  talks with her mouth full of strawberry, "Next one?" --</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...wat</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Maybe because that might have been a healing potion?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: i guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a feeling the rest of these are going to be made of similar fruit and medicine cabinet combos.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huhwhat</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  stops pouring, half of it is in the bowl --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT purpleTiger <span style="color:#8700cb">[CPT]</span>  the potion liquid changes again, this time from black to a bright green --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT purpleTiger's <span style="color:#8700cb">[CPT'S]</span>  legs are a lot longer, feet having turned digitigrade from plantigrade.

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT purpleTiger <span style="color:#8700cb">[CPT]</span>  sits back, a giant tail waving behind her, and her face having turned into the muzzle of a tiger --</span><br />
