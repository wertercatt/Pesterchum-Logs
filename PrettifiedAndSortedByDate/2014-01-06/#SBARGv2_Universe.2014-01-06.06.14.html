[11:37:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: are we going to become an underwater village now? :(</span><br />
[11:37:42] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Was it realy nessisary to use sexplosives?</span><br />
[11:37:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, I was /slightly/ joking. But it might be a bit muddier if the water doesn't refreeze.</span><br />
[11:37:51] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: exploseves*!</span><br />
[11:37:54] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DS, I didn't use any explosives.</span><br />

[11:38:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was a steam explosion.</span><br />
[11:38:12] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh, that flame power of yours?</span><br />
[11:38:13] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: well you could have fooled me.</span><br />
[11:39:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, we don't need to worry about flooding.</span><br />
[11:39:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Until it warms up here.</span><br />
[11:40:38] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Im building the utiment sledding hill.</span><br />
[11:41:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well I'm going to see about redirecting the magma.</span><br />
[11:41:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I can get us some fucking hotsprings.</span><br />
[11:41:42] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: be carfull</span><br />
[11:42:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly, the server keychain seemed to have stopped working.</span><br />
[11:43:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I might have to cancel that project.</span><br />
[11:45:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...why did it stop worki-- oh, because it's technically Sburb tech and got depowered like the alchemiters did?</span><br />
[11:46:01] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#0000ff">CURRENT blueBassist [CBB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[11:46:01] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Heyo...</span><br />

[11:46:16] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...How are things?...</span><br />
[11:46:27] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a theory about how to get them to work again, but it won't happen on /this planet/</span><br />
[11:46:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I'm pretty sure about that.</span><br />
[11:46:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup BB</span><br />
[11:46:42] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hi...</span><br />
[11:47:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would you guys like me to melt a path?</span><br />
[11:47:20] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...FL I think I know what your plan is, and the probability of finding one of the planets in this universe destined for a Sburb session is astronomical. ltierally.</span><br />
[11:47:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[11:47:44] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Isnt this one destined for that?</span><br />
[11:47:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering my theory involves the existance of frog temples on a planet.</span><br />
[11:48:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no DS, there's no First Guardian or Frog Temple on this planet.</span><br />
[11:48:18] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: ok</span><br />
[11:49:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, as you all remember, Alchemy is possible slightly before entry.</span><br />
[11:49:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For objects such as perfectly generic objects.</span><br />
[11:50:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that has made me think about it, and I'm currently between two theorys.</span><br />
[11:50:31] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Quick question: How much has it snowed since last night?...</span><br />
[11:50:51] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: the town is covered in 20 ft</span><br />
[11:51:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1, That the Frog Temples create a "sburb field" around a planet allowing for alchemy to work... or 2, PARADOX SPACE IS BULLSHIT AND MAKES NO SENSE.</span><br />
[11:51:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But its likely the first one.</span><br />
[11:51:35] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why can't it be both? <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
[11:52:02] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm sure paradox not making sense is a universal constant...</span><br />
[11:52:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it seems paradox space has been /trying/ to stay self consistant.</span><br />
[11:52:13] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: after all, the alchemiters seemed to work on the Troll Meteor during transit, far outside of both a universe OR a session.</span><br />
[11:53:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, but it was also moving in the furthest ring, which /has/ no stable physics.</span><br />
[11:53:18] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
[11:54:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, it is breathable to non gods, and also has no atmosphere.</span><br />
[11:54:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Otherwise the Troll Meteor would have slowed down.</span><br />
[11:55:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Due to hitting oxygen atoms that were in the way.</span><br />
[11:56:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, at least the logic of paradox space /trys/ to make sense.</span><br />
[11:56:39] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I feel like I'm spending too much time just going with the flow and missing out on stuff...</span><br />
[11:58:02] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: Ok the hill is done!</span><br />
[11:58:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to try to find the bar.</span><br />
[11:59:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /try/, being the defining word.</span><br />
[11:59:04] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: I can just port yo there Charlie</span><br />
[11:59:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DS, do /you/ know where it is under all of this snow?</span><br />
[11:59:36] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: yes</span><br />
[11:59:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right, space player sense.</span><br />
[11:59:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shouldn't doubt it.</span><br />
[11:59:53] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: yep</span><br />
[11:59:58] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: lol</span><br />
[12:00:44] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: any way the hill is done</span><br />
[12:01:03] <span style="color:#008400">CDS: it is 30 feet of sledding hill awsomeness!</span><br />
[12:01:17] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...I'm going to take a look around then...</span><br />
[12:01:17] <span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...bbl...</span><br />
