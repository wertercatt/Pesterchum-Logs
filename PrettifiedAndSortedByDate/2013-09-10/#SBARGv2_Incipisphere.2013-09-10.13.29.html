<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright... pretty sure the right one it the red card.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: is*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, /here we go/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: like I said, stand on top to stay out of the way</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT frozenLake's <span style="color:#0080ff">[CFL'S]</span>  computer was crus- LOL NOPE HAHAHA BEST PRANK --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: telling from the holes... "0AmYksYT"</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: putting it back in now</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: ((loltoasts))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( the "AmY" part? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: ((yep))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so, that will allow you to do all the possible operations on a built in computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and it /automatically/ holo pad previews before you make it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you know, just incase of it being Strange Matter or Antimatter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#12bc00">[CPK]</span>  intergates device --</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Or a bomb :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Like once i fucked up really bad :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no, those two are much worse</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 I accidetly made a subspace bomb :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Antimatter causes a massive explosion...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /what/</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: 8ut su8space doesn't... exist...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK:  :3  <a href='http://super-smash-bros.wikia.com/wiki/Subspace_Bomb'>http://super-smash-bros.wikia.com/wiki/Subspace_Bomb</a> :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...anyway, Antimatter causes a massive explosion, but Strange Matter... oh /man/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Amy, you've only touched teh tip of teh wierd iceberg in this session :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its like King Midas, except instead of everything you touch turning to gold, everything it touches turns to /shit/ then whatever /that/ touches turns to shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and then before you know it everything is /shit/ and its /your fault/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I don't even really understand the concept of strange matter... especially why does it strangify everything else it touches?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't even know</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 That would be an awesome weapon though :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I know that its /bad/ and... not a single timeline or universe has made it, or they have and its really /really/ far away in the furthest ring</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and has no paths backwards in time</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Like you hit an imp with it, and it spreeds from imp to imp, and you have lots of shit :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: pk no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it doesn't just affect imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Aw :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: it also affects the /ground/ and /air/</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Wait how would you know :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: theoretical physics</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so it's basically a Grey Goo scenario, but instead of nanobots, it's /the motherbarking laws of physics itself/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP has it down</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: This is scaring me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But at least its not possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, wouldn't that cascade through the furthest ring and wipe out all of space time?</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: eep</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: in the /entire multiverse/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 WHY IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE TO MAKE :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 You'd think Paradox Space would not give it a code, like pumpkins :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it can't go through vacuum though... can it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and the Furthest Ring is just as empty-vacuum as regular spacetime...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I would assume SBURB would be smart enough /not/ to give it a code</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: also, let me make a rule that I think the session should follow</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: Can we stop talking a8out this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DON'T MAKE MASSIVE PARTICLE COLLIDERS</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: alright Amy</span><br />
<span style="color:#be00be">CAS: Thank you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and I guess that It would stop at the edge of a session...</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 but still :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously I don't know how air even works out here</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 It's just a bad idea :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 or internet connection :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 also how is my wireless still shit :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, its not like the meteor was sealed, so its not a vaccum out there... yet, they didn't have /air friction/</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 i always have to use wired :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: tell me about it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: seriously why the /fuck/ do my shades always give out around cookilizers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug. ever since I managed to alchemize this new gaming desktop, my scrolltop and other wireless systems lose connection briefly when the /desktop/ reboots.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: probably still there, that cold ball of ice. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I say we should gather up the belongings in his house and make a shrine...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: to our old leader</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: ...yeah. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 Im thinking of starting a LoCaL gaveyard, maybe we could put it tehre :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think the shrine would be best kept in the Base.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 kay :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 I was just offering :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: well, I don't /actually/ know</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 hey if I went to earth and timetraveled back to pre-session could i return to normal earth :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 sorry i was wondering :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you would either be doomed or deal with meteors a second time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 and tehn tehre would be two LoCaLs :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 or id have 2 planets :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 and thats just wierd :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: well, depends on how you get back ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: there's always the frog temple thing ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 so maybe I could convince my friends to play :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 but if I could, tehy'd already be here wouldnt tehy... :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: could be the time scaling</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 or tehir entries are fartehr down teh line :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: delayed entry, out of contact, there's all sorts of reasons they could have not contacted yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah, I've gotten it down to a science, the delayed entry</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they will /always/ enter at the time of day they left...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, every hour of entry equals a month here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 because bullshit :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, someone who entered 2 hours after the first entry, would enter 2 months into the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but the /time/ they show up /here/ would be equal to the time of day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 So possibly ive already saved tehm but tehy havent showed up yet because of that :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe you didn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: didn't /need/ to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 unfurtantly I have no way of knowing until eitehr I fo or tehy show up :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 *go :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and this time thing spreads into the /minutes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think i did my math wrong, hold on</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: every two hours equals a month here</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so people that entered 24 hours late would get here a YEAR later? O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and that splits into minutes lining up with days</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but by then, most of the world would have been wrecked, so those would likely be the last entries.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 huh :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so, what is the time setting on the V2 Blog again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: idk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm just trying to calculate /what time of day/ we need to watch out for play entry.</span><br />
