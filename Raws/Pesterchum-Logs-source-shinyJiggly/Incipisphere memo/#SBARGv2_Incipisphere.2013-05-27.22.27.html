<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#a37fce">CURRENT sleepingTimetravlur [CST]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I have sunken into some emotional stress that might as well turn into the Green Sun...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: D: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: also, I wasn't able to find what the mysterious note was pointing to... apparently I need more carapace reputation to access that part of Prospit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: what's wrong ST? er, TT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: If you need to talk, we could always have a hardcore feeling's jam at the base.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: And even then I'm not even sure that I'm safe here, either....</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean about that thing that you and RS were almost talking about earlier?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: Y-yeah...there's someone in my head...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: and that someone is the Denizen of my planet...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: uh-oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, what kinda stuff are they saying?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: are you a Mind player?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: helpful stuff? harmful stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: confusing stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...Remember that time you had to rescue me?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: Mind denizens might do psychological warfare instead of physical strifing...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: The state I was in?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I'm a life player, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, when you were all ink-dark and stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I was under the denizen's control...in a way...</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: SA, quiet for a few minutes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: My denizen...I don't think she's snake-like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I...understand what you mean.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Does she look like a person?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sound like one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: I don't know...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I really want to help, I'm just not sure how. It'd be nice to know something about the denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...something about...taking away human emotion...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: she's...corrupted....</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: not completely...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Alright, that's a start. She's trying to..break you, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She's corrupted enough?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: i guess...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: starting to remind me of my relationship with my denizen.. though he was actually a lot nicer from the sound of it...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: there's still a part of her left that's still pure...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which part reaches out to you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: and a bit of that part is...around the base...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: remember that luminous rose..?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oooh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I think I understand it a bit then..</span><br />

<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: or something like that...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a37fce">CST: ...and I don't know if I'm up to that task...</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Sometimes you well, get asked to do things you might not be up to</span><br />
