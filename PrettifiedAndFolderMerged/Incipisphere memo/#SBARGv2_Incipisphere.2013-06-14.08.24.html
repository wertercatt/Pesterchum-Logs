<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, Gates are not a thing that currently exists because of Bakagami's rampage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: unless your using it to get a computer, than your pretty much screwed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hence why we all have to fly, warp, or transportalize between lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Wait, Voldemort fucked our gates? What'd he /do/ to 'em?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: blewτhemup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: left or right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: inτhewholespriτecaτasτrophe</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: He fucked us and in doing so he fucked them up to the breaking point</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Let us chalk this up to just another of the vile actions that that bastard will pay for in the end</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ... Welp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: One of the many...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: right was wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: where would i find grist torrent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Make it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: just get it from a furthest ring server</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: or did those get destroyed to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: It should be fairly simple to find.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: its fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ag is sending me a copy</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Ah, good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Brilliant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: if there are more of those forks in the road I am going to be really annoyed</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And get yourself a strife specibus as fast as possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, sooner or later you'll hit a consort village, and then they'll be able to tell you where to go for things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I already have two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Any will do, doesn't matter how crappy you are with it at first</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: oh? which two?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Which ones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: cuestickkind and riflekind</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( /me just realized there are FOUR players that all have almost the same shade of red text ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: (( Pff-))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((isn't one of them))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((swag((</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I kind of put holes in the imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...cuestickKind? first time I've heard of that being used.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's inovative.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Riflekind is UP in this game</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Shit let's be Venom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Trust me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because I prototyped an animal I shot holes into</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What /does/ everyone use? I've got cardKind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: laserKind</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: EpeeKind</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: i really hope none of you have trypophobia when we face the king</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: laser pointers gone crazy</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I mostly use spearKind, but have crossbowKind as a backup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: which reminds me</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: cardKind?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: brushKind, and I gained reflectorKind when I self-protoed (but technically the specific weapon is keytoolKind)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: since we have so many prototypings what does our battle field look like?</span><br />
DL: keyKind. It's fun.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: keyblade</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: ... well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: kingdom  hearts</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Phew, shame you didn't show up earlier, you could've been a part of gettin' one of those tarots.</span><br />
IP: bladeKind or whipKind!<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but really</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: what does the battlefield look like</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tarots? Ha! I've got an entire deck of those xD</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: do carapacians have blood?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: they must</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: ... yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The Chumosphere says that</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Cut one and find out?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: no one's even seen the Black King or Queen</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I don't know if that's true but</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: SCIENCE!</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I don't particularly wish to find out</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because if they do</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: AG you're worrying me :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think their all going to have holes in them</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: if they do, then... eeek</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Underlings don't so far as I know</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Somethin' the matter EQ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: they just get bruises and bumps</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Aw, c'mon. It was a joke. Mostly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: underlings don't, they just explode into grist</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: right up until they explode into grist</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: good</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CSE</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because I was worried I was going to start finding underling blood everywhere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (or flowers and grist, if the finishing blow was done with my brush-tail)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I really hope that the queens and kings don't bleed from that either</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: they probabely won't.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: hopefully</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: that would be too little of a challenge</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ... Doesn't the Archagent bleed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the King and Queen are carapacian though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Carapacians bleed, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Underlings, probably not. They're like, made from materials and junk.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: gross</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: true</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Hey</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: trust me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the underlings seem to be really unhealthy, however</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: you spend several weeks here</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: You'll start bleeding too</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Blood grist. Almost is like the same thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: a lot of them just stagger about</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Wounds are no joke, so get yourself some healing items on the by and by</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Its actually kind of sad</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: In other words, food and bandages</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess I should have let Jasper die completely before I shot him</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ((shit))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I mean, let him die before prototyping</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I prototyped my sick dog</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: pore dog...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: oh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: How is he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: he's actually pretty good</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: unlike the imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Thats good to hear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: who seem to be taking all of his bad health</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Always good</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's weird for the first few bits I find</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: But to be fair</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: having your former pet suddenly be talking to you</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: My kernel is my grandma</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: grandogsprite</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so they wouldn't have the revived health of my grandma</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I mean SimKittysprite remains aderpable but her ability to rattle off city-building tips and ask for crunchies at the same time was unnerving for a while</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: &gt;:/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I prototyped a Plush Amaterasu Toy... so technically no dead-revival, but still weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Jasper is actually with me right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: she-he has been mauling imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and the fact that she's half of my thinkpan took some getting used to, but other than the ocassional ironic bark, I'm 0kay with it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: thats good</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: By the way, we're hanging out with consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: they've been telling me a lot about the planet</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: What sort of animals are they?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: they are Chameleons</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: if you ever visit my land, I must warn you: do NOT accept drinks from my consorts. their vodka is stronger than sopor pie.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: kind of hard to see sometimes</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Oh, Nice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Same as mine then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so they've been telling me about my Denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: theres an entire lore behind him</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I would advise you never to go to LOGAM and expect help from the Consorts until after the Remaking of the Lighthouse</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: apparantely sometime before I entered the medium, he tyrannically ruled over them</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ghosts aren't much use</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and then the blizards and frost started happening</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and he got stuck underground</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: they believe that when go God Tier the ice binding him will be weakened and he will escape</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I'll then have to fight him</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: If that's the case it probably won't be for a while, then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: they also say that my bed is at the end of the road</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: i'm not sure how good that is</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Best to get your gear in tip-top shape before then</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: warning: quest beds are busted as hell right now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: apparantely many die attempting to reach the end of the road</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Climb those rungs well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so i'm going to take it slow</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Reminds me, who all are our Denizens so far?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: good idea</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Clio</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Hm... I have athena</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Light Player, so Cetus.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what broken with them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: As for myself, Abaddon</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: man, it's like half of you guys don't even check the guardian's blog</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Interesting thing:</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i didnt know tumblr still worked</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it does</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Oh yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I was fighting off an ogre earlier to help them</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i know now</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Oh, don't worry about it much SE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and in the proccess we smashed open the road</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I found a transportalizer system under the road</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Didn't remember I /had/ a Tumblr until now. Have no clue /why/ I do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i think i trust the word you guys tell more if apparently the guardian blog tricked you guys into almost killing your sprites</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: according to you lot</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what is up with the quest beds?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The bastard masquerading as our first guardian</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SE: no, actually there's a real First Guardian that runs the blog now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: have you traced 'the bastard'?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Bakagami ollied outy to Skaia knows where.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: most likely destroyed them to prevent us from moving up to the next series of rungs</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: long story short: skaia's too messy to do the thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Ornis, as far as we can tell, is a good guy though</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />

<span style="color:#969619">CEU: our real First Guardian, so to speak</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if skaia is too messed up to clean the game</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wouldnt it be up to us</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the players</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: to fix it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: the veil...</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: ((fuck. ignore that comma))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: then why don't we commission derse dreamers?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: The problem is, glitches can hurt us, or do nasty things as well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: to search the veil for him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: How can we fix the game we're playing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so can taking a hit</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: Isn'τ τhaτ suicide</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: We're not the programmers</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: because he's got the powers of time and space</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And, uh, if you got fooled once by a fakey-fake Guardian... how do you know this dude isn't just as fake?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Nor the developers</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we cant trust anyone but eachother really</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Frack.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Hence why the suggestions that</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: we form some sort of militia</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm one for one when it comes to vouching for people...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ((do the oracle clouds still work?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((nope))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: slow down</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Militia?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: to build up a force to deal with the bastard when he comes out of hiding, or eventually to track him down ourselves</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: not some militia</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: just</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hold up</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hes the bad guy cause he can beat us</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I'm sure there is a way to defeat him</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Skaia has its ways</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why would we want to march off to fight him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: its suicide that way</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But for right now, we can't do jack squat other than</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: continue as far as we can on our Land Quests</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: and submit bugs into the First Guardian to fix them</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: yup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Future Skaia, you mean. Present Skaia is a fucknig piece of glitchbage</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: thats like saying rather than learn more about the solution lets just add to the problem though</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I've sent in my reports so far, and nothing new much has come up since then</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: finding him might be the key to accessing our god tiers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: but</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: i think we should atleast consider it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and devise a plan for it in the mean time</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: For now... For now all we can do is get as strong as we possibly can. Try and tap into our aspect powers, or just making headway in understanding our aspects, getting to our Denizens and...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: did you catch the prego? I mean ragu.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I d✮n't kn✮w...it's just that everything seems m✮re clear t✮ me n✮w!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: Octoroon Rangoon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: As if I c✮uld feel every star in the night sky shining d✮wn ✮n me and filling my being with light!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((horrible repeating joke is horrible))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: did</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Octowhat now</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: did you guys just invite the guardian to the apparent player headquarters?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: But I d✮n't see h✮w I c✮uld have caught s✮mething fr✮m in here!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's like that spc about comic sans</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: It's pretty high up :/</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: i uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: think we did</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: he's pretty cool</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: i guess just, getting to know him and such</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: is</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: single-handedly the worst idea i have heard</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: as of yet</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#00aa00">CURRENT doctorSleep [CDS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: good evening evryone</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hi DS</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why would you invite him to where you apparently plan everything if we cant trust him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Perhaps it w✮uld all✮w y✮u t✮ investigate the idea that he is als✮ a fakey-fake First Guardian? &gt;:)</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, I trusthim more than the other guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: why would i want to get close to him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: Hi SJ</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that doesnt make any sense</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the issue is that we cant trust these so called guardians</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: they can dance circles around us because of an apparent case of omnipotence that they achieve from being linked to the green sun</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: hmm? oh you mean Ornis?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Keep your friends close and enemies closer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I mean, if the dude's omnipotent, he'd've been able to just show up there, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: I would like to point out that since he took over the clouds have been making more since.'</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so youre saying he has control of the clouds that show us things meant to aim us in certain direction?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Actually, what's the directions to that place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ NO more like he fixed the clouds /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ apparentlyy /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: apparently</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: more ore less</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ I would not advise anyyone coming here /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: because we dont actually know how anything works </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He seems a lot more down to earth at the very least. I think there's a good chance we can trust him; he was screwed over by That Man and trapped, and he wouldn't have done that if they were working together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Probably</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\ who is not alreadyy here /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tch, w/e.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: he can change things to fit how we think it works and still be wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or you know</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: well if your so conserned send an ask</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what would that achieve?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I am currently s✮mewhere with a l✮t ✮f g✮ld and yell✮w</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: thats what ist there fore</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: PRetty terrible fashi✮n sense actuallly!</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: Sonds like your on Prospit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG:  Uh, also, villains screwing over teammates is a thing that can happen. And frequently does. Not to mention stuff like pretending to be trapped to garner a sympathy vote. If you're lying, better make it /good/, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: which is where I am currently beeing asleep and all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: thanks ag</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: all im saying</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: trusting him right off the bat is incredibly... ugh i dont know the word</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: stupid?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: just</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: way to brash</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What would be your suggestion then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: act with a sense of caution</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What makes you think we're not doing that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: every action he makes is one to be considered as that of an enemy held at arms reach</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: can'τmemoτoobusywiτhτhebirdomgomg</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: ok what would you sugest then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what about bird dong?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: dont trust him for starters</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or it</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or her</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: him</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: ohmygodsj</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ag said it right when they said that it could be a simple change of faces</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: tt you okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: TT are you ok?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: She'll be fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but you still want to trust him dont you rs</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: She's just got a bad case of the fangirls</span><br />
DL: Changing the way you type or act is one of the simplest things to do.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Because I wanna have an ally in this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: youre throwing away any sense of self preservation for the notion that he might be an ally</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ONE WE CANT TRUST</span><br />
DL: Not to take sides, but is there any proof he is our ally? Real proof, not hopes or dreams?<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: did we ever even see the last fg?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: did we ever make contact with him?</span><br />
IP: Lars, he said something about the Green Sun.<br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: can we be certain in who we're dealing with isnt just the last fg </span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Well, we're making conact with this guy, pretty definitively</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no shit!</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you let him into your base!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And if Voldemort's also a sweet-talking bird?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: then theyre fucked</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: well we couldent have realy stoped him cold we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the action of trying to act is better than letting things act around you</span><br />
DL: Oh, right, so he did... Does anyone know what the Green Sun has to do with being a First Guardian, or how he used it?<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we arent scenery</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I th✮ught Mr. V✮ldem✮rt was a cr✮ss-dressing dem✮n ✮f space and time th✮ugh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aa00">CDS: difrent you know who</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you all so blindly trust the creature that puts out information from a blog</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you invite it into your home</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and i cant for the life of me understand why</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what if it stopped talking?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what if it lead us right into the place we needed to be and simply stopped leading</span><br />
