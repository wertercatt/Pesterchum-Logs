[09:22:12] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...yeah, but masterballs are the easy way out.</span><br />
[09:22:12] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: When it killed a puppy and transformed into an Abra, teleporting away.</span><br />
[09:22:16] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...</span><br />
[09:22:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not Black Kyurem.</span><br />
[09:22:48] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Awww!!! It turned into an Abra?</span><br />
[09:22:48] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And I still doubt that anyone will let you keep the mew, AG. I seriously doubt it.</span><br />
[09:22:55] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Abras are even more adorable! ^_^</span><br />
[09:23:45] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It teleported away. We don't know where it is. Gambit no you are not keeping the cat-god-monster-thing. No.</span><br />
[09:24:02] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You forget you're talking to the best tracker in the Session.</span><br />
[09:24:15] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And fuck you. /Mew/.</span><br />
[09:24:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I've managed to figure out the moves it knows as normal mew.</span><br />
[09:25:03] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: shuriken everywhere @ _@ ➜</span><br />
[09:25:11] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 1. Okay true fair enough. 2. GAMBIT FEW PEOPLE TRUST YOU WITH A KNIFE, NONE THE LESS A FLIPPIN MEW.</span><br />
[09:25:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ what</span><br />
[09:25:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: watching a video ➜</span><br />
[09:25:28] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Which are, FL?</span><br />
[09:25:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Psychic, Aura Sphere, Swagger, and Transform.</span><br />
[09:25:42] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: EQ, people trust me with a giant robot made of death lasers.</span><br />
[09:25:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: which one?</span><br />
[09:25:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oooh, nice moveset...</span><br />
[09:25:59] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And I have no idea why so.</span><br />
[09:26:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why does his neck have a snake boner ➜</span><br />
[09:26:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And considering Aura Sphere, its a Lv100.</span><br />
[09:26:13] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Because I'm responsible. And okay.</span><br />
[09:26:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ, link and approximate time you're at?</span><br />
[09:26:23] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Wild, presumably hostile, Lv100 Mew.</span><br />
[09:26:37] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Loose… waaait. /Clones/.</span><br />
[09:26:57] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Considering it already killed something, then I think its a safe bet to pin it down as hostile- Eh?</span><br />
[09:26:58] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's one of those videos RS linked to about an hour back. ➜</span><br />
[09:27:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah, Crux is a mutant clone of Buddy.</span><br />
[09:27:25] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … So if it's going by /that/ motivation...</span><br />
[09:27:27] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: he linked a bunch... also huh?</span><br />
[09:27:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Ectobiology.</span><br />
[09:27:43] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What other clones are there?</span><br />
[09:27:47] <span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: EQ trust me, you're not the only person wondering why so.</span><br />
[09:28:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...It might not have realized where it was at the time.</span><br />
[09:28:09] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: hmph</span><br />
[09:28:14] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: /Pawssibly/, FL. But before we start doing ecto, are there any other known clone-things?</span><br />
[09:28:17] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: wait... clones?</span><br />
[09:28:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Pretty much all of the frogs?</span><br />
[09:28:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And Mewtwo?</span><br />
[09:28:52] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So it can be expected to show up around LOFAT again.</span><br />
[09:28:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, "huh?" as in "wait that's who Crux was cloned from?"</span><br />
[09:29:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
