<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((land quest))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((mmk, just wondering. if it's as long as last week's dungeon thing, I'll have to miss it since I gotta do a thing at 5:15 pst))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: faHD</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm okay</span><br />

<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((hey, I'm wondering, around what level are the players right now ? i mean, the think closest to levels.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((iirc mostly everyone's at gate 1-2-3 right ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((Gate 3 is as high as has been "unlocked". we're waiting for the guardian to "fix" Gate 4 before we can continue))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((alright.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((sooo what's this planned event ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((TT is going through a mansion on her land that might be important, puzzles and monsters probably))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((there's going to be a player limit))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((alright. How long before it starts ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I prefer asking in delays because dealing with timezones is ew))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((4 hours or something))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah, damn it again, I don't think I'll be able to watch then))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((in the Minebent thread, we refer to time-by-delay as "Trollian Time". # useless trivia ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((*takes note*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((that's nice))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I found a note on the floor</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: from your spriτe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's hard to tell</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: "Wear that freaking vest already!" is all that it says.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: o-o</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess I have to wear that stupid brown poofy vest thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but not before I make it at least a little nicer looking</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably should make the new features hidden</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: so, I took a look at that pseudo-cursed-zone I found outside my dwelling spire... and I was right. cracked terrain, glowing green pixelated energy. it's the spitting image of the Corrupted Server.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: o-o</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((is there a character/status sheet somewhere, to keep track on how everyone's doing, what they've alchemized, glitches encountered, their progress or something ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((LL: not really, though some of us blog our adventures under the # v2journal tag))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((not really, most people keep track of their own stuff and maybe make tumblr posts ocasionally))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((I'd love to have more infos in order to follow these awesome looking chats))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((ah well))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((isn't it a bit difficult to go 'hey you didn't habe that awesome pogo-stick last time' 'oh but I alchemized it and i forgot about it see here *link* ?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((it's more of make-it-up-as-you-go-as-long-as-you-don't-go-too-overpowered))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((kinda, but you gotta remember that somebody has to take the time to update stuff like that))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((yeah, guess so))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((though with stuff like piratepad you can add your own stuff as you go))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((there's a general piratepad? besides the one specifically for puzzle-solving?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((you know, if you want, you can feel free to try and keep track of random character development))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((nah I was thinking of creating one or something and yeah keep track of stuff))</span><br />
<span style="color:#eacf00">CLL: ((but anyway g2g))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((RS was planning on making a tvtropes page a few days ago))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((seeya))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((and the character sheet would probably have all that stuff))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((*waves*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I think he said that he wasn't going to cover anyone because we're technically not apart of the thing))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((I was thinking it'd be like the Sburb Patch Notes page, where any of the "regular" players could post a short thing... but wwhatevver :P))</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CCP: ((also, why do I suddenly want to replay Yoshi's Island DS?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: PUDDING</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ???</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I hass τhe pudding</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I hope I don'τ randomly fall asleep and slam my face in iτ</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: τhaτ would be bad</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: welp, tiem to start hopping gates.</span><br />
