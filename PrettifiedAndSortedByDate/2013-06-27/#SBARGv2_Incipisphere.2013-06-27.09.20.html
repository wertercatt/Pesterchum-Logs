<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: how did it go with your denizen? Did you meet them?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: I did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sometimes I wonder why I even stay here.Lately it's been nothing but arguements, drama, and explosives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, despite that, it really is the safest place to sleep in the game. you're almost always alone at your dwelling spire, and the dream moons technically count as "places where you go when ALREADY asleep"</span><br />

<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Are you talking about the cafe/</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: there's a bunch of rooms for players to stay in</span><br />

<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: Ah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, that's pretty much standard</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: I don't really mind my home.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: All alchemy rooms are awesome rooms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been thinking about going back to lohan soon. </span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and the cafe has a replicator that actually makes GOOD food instead of alchemiter-blended-mush.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Food.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What a strange and foreign concept.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's something that people eat, apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Mind-blowing</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: You don't believe in it either, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: I can't believe it's not butter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's actually lemon fudge :D</span><br />
<span style="color:#8700cb">CPT: That sounds delicious.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, the alchemiter can only duplicate the base code of an item. the stuff that makes food actually taste like food is in the metadata part, which the replicator correctly duplicates but the alchemiter just replaces it with a spoonful of Pain Yogurt and drywall.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Doing training anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Aw, but you'll miss all the epicness. For some definitions of epic. What sort of training d'you do? :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Eh, not feeling too hot either way. Can afford to miss out on the "epic".</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: D:</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Hate to raid another person's fridge while I'm just a guest but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just ask MA. Or yoink it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yoinking is always the solution.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Dunno. I wasn't there for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think I gained a level because of how hard I was vacantly boggling at the shenanigans.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I have music on. Can't hear a thing. Is it bad?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Basically people don't trust my word that I know what I'm doing and would rather micromanage shit that doesn't need it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But what else is new.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Oh, does your thingy work?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hey, nice!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Containment? Raz, what are you doing, and is anyone dead?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You take a Pokemon away from me, call me crazy, then you do THIS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: This is a syndrome of Pot calling the Kettle black, and YOU KNOW IT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is that what this is about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Do you want your Skarmory back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, I'm just saying.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I just wanted to know how long it could handle max capacity like that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The worst that would've happened was some stray flames and a little explosion, like the one from the alchemy room that didn't actually do anything but leave a little soot and ash</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I told you guys I had it covered. It doesn't look it, but I /do/ know what I'm doing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Dude, you do realize that thing was hot enough to melt GOLD, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That hot?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Huh... Yeah it'd probably melt right through the ground if it got to that point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No good in that case. So, definitely not gonna shift it up that high again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, heat radiation doesn't function the same way in sburb as it does on earth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is how we can have our lava lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Lava lands...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah, right pain in the ass...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Would a board like that work in a lethal lava land?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Amost definitely</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: *almost</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: speaking of, you are keeping that thing at least one Prospit-diameter away from my land. I /like/ my Frozen Fucking Tundra being frozen, thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, it was over 1000 degrees Celsius.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah, sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not sure how heat radiation works in sburb, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats got.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hot*</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The wheel casing contains it almost completely. The leaking heat's still a thing at that level, but.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: YEah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hell, I'm amazed it WASN'T Liquid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, is it made of tungsten or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: by the way, do we even /have/ a lava-class land? looking over my playerlist, I don't see any Heat or Lava land types...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm not gonna push it that hard again anyway, don't worry. I'm not trying to melt anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The last part of my land is a Lethal Lava Land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Titanium?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. Spells and Echoes doesn't exactly imply lava, so I wasn't sure...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: My land's got /three/ different biomes, now...</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: And here I thought you were on drugs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well I did have a few ounces before I left the earth</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A few ounces of what, liquid courage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Courage is just being more afraid of something else than you are of what's in front of you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Or maybe that's bravery. Same diff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay Rob liquid courage is slang for alcohol and it ISN'T measured in ounces</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Courage is being afraid but not letting that stop you.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: the only bad part is, EventRoutineGetTiger.~ath will nullpointerexception if the player doesn't have an actual "canon" class.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so no matter what classes we decide to give ourselves, until the canon title isn't an empty string, quest beds can't work at all</span><br />
