<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( so did anyone ever take FL up on his offer ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#008400">CURRENT doctorSpace [CDS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ((no we all slept at the bar))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( ...okay. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: (( <a href='#SBARGv2_StarterPlanet'>#SBARGv2_StarterPlanet</a> ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Charlie what was that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: guys I'm sorry in advance if the town gets flooded.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But I really need to melt this snow.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: no dont do that! We are diging a tunnlenetwork!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why does noone tell me these things!</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: you were asleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And I was cleaning off my balcony.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: are we going to become an underwater village now? :(</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Was it realy nessisary to use sexplosives?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, I was /slightly/ joking. But it might be a bit muddier if the water doesn't refreeze.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: exploseves*!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...DS, I didn't use any explosives.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I used me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That was a steam explosion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...oh, that flame power of yours?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: well you could have fooled me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, we don't need to worry about flooding.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Until it warms up here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Im building the utiment sledding hill.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well I'm going to see about redirecting the magma.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So I can get us some fucking hotsprings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: be carfull</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sadly, the server keychain seemed to have stopped working.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I might have to cancel that project.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...why did it stop worki-- oh, because it's technically Sburb tech and got depowered like the alchemiters did?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0000ff">CURRENT blueBassist [CBB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Heyo...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Hay BB</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...How are things?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a theory about how to get them to work again, but it won't happen on /this planet/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I'm pretty sure about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup BB</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hi...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Would you guys like me to melt a path?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...FL I think I know what your plan is, and the probability of finding one of the planets in this universe destined for a Sburb session is astronomical. ltierally.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Isnt this one destined for that?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering my theory involves the existance of frog temples on a planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no DS, there's no First Guardian or Frog Temple on this planet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: ok</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, as you all remember, Alchemy is possible slightly before entry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: For objects such as perfectly generic objects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: However, that has made me think about it, and I'm currently between two theorys.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Quick question: How much has it snowed since last night?...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: the town is covered in 20 ft</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 1, That the Frog Temples create a "sburb field" around a planet allowing for alchemy to work... or 2, PARADOX SPACE IS BULLSHIT AND MAKES NO SENSE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But its likely the first one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: why can't it be both? <img src='smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I'm sure paradox not making sense is a universal constant...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, it seems paradox space has been /trying/ to stay self consistant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: after all, the alchemiters seemed to work on the Troll Meteor during transit, far outside of both a universe OR a session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: True, but it was also moving in the furthest ring, which /has/ no stable physics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, it is breathable to non gods, and also has no atmosphere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Otherwise the Troll Meteor would have slowed down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Due to hitting oxygen atoms that were in the way.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But yeah, at least the logic of paradox space /trys/ to make sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...I feel like I'm spending too much time just going with the flow and missing out on stuff...</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: Ok the hill is done!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm going to try to find the bar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: I can just port yo there Charlie</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /try/, being the defining word.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: DS, do /you/ know where it is under all of this snow?</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: right, space player sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: shouldn't doubt it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: yep</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: lol</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: any way the hill is done</span><br />
<span style="color:#008400">CDS: it is 30 feet of sledding hill awsomeness!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...Hm...I'm going to take a look around then...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000ff">CBB: ...bbl...</span><br />
