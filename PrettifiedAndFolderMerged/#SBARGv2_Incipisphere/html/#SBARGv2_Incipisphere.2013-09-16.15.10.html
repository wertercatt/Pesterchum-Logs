[07:57:37] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: murdering an ai really shouldnt be an issue</span><br />
[07:57:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: plus he is on a cloud network</span><br />
[07:57:58] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: Why not, SL?</span><br />
[07:58:07] <span style="color:#000000">CAE: Is murdering a person not an issue?</span><br />
[07:58:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: because you should have /backups/</span><br />
[07:58:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: regardless, my denizen blew up his-</span><br />
[07:58:23] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, SL</span><br />
[07:58:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'll make a clone of you and kill you.</span><br />
[07:58:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay?</span><br />
[07:58:53] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the point is it seems like a waste of effort to target an ai</span><br />
[07:58:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Is that "alright"?</span><br />
[07:59:02] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: you wont be able to wipe it out</span><br />
[07:59:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: and you could turn that effort towards killing the player</span><br />
[07:59:31] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: sounds like your denizen is bad at plans to me</span><br />
[07:59:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Perhaps his goal was simply to piss me off?</span><br />
[07:59:49] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Are you still having clone problems?</span><br />
[07:59:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: be cause he sure as hell did a good job at that.</span><br />
[07:59:50] <span style="color:#000000">CTT: noÏ„ Ï„his shiÏ„ again</span><br />
[07:59:56] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: there are much easier ways to do that</span><br />
[08:00:14] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: why not try, say, destroying your dwelling spire</span><br />
[08:00:22] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>.</span><br />
[08:00:23] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: What.</span><br />
[08:00:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[08:00:44] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: would be much easier and piss you off about as well</span><br />
[08:00:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: considering i'm still waiting for the radiation to clear up...</span><br />
[08:00:55] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: especially since you dont have a backup of that</span><br />
[08:01:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm kinda glad that we have ectobiology</span><br />
[08:01:21] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: which, philosophy aside, does mean that killing an ai has less impact than it would otherwise</span><br />
[08:01:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: that way I don't have to worry about my kids</span><br />
[08:01:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright</span><br />
[08:01:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Considering that DT is a backup of /me/</span><br />
[08:02:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like literally that was his orignal job</span><br />
[08:02:13] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i /understand/ all this</span><br />
[08:02:25] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[08:02:26] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: FL.</span><br />
[08:02:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: would killing me be okay since we have DT as a backup?</span><br />
[08:02:31] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: HOW THE FUCK.</span><br />
[08:02:32] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: the point is that if an ai is killed you can have something that is functionally identical</span><br />
[08:02:33] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ARE YOU.</span><br />
[08:02:35] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: STILL.</span><br />
[08:02:40] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: no because dt has branched off from you</span><br />
[08:02:42] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: ALLLIIIIVVVVVEEEE!?!?!?!</span><br />
[08:02:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Simple.</span><br />
[08:04:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not going to say why!</span><br />
[08:04:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I</span><br />
[08:05:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It may have something to do with my alchemy</span><br />
[08:05:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: did you make gordon freeman's suit</span><br />
[08:06:14] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have healing items that ensure I won't be dying from poison or other slow damaging effects.</span><br />
[08:06:23] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh yeah</span><br />
[08:06:23] <span style="color:#000000">CTT: waiÏ„</span><br />
[08:06:26] <span style="color:#000000">CTT: where are you</span><br />
[08:06:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But that isn't the reason.</span><br />
[08:06:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm in the <span style="color:#bacafe">BaCafÃ©</span>.</span><br />
[08:06:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why?</span><br />
[08:06:38] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[08:06:49] <span style="color:#000000">CTT: and where is Ï„his radiaÏ„on Ï„hing</span><br />
[08:06:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: my house.</span><br />
[08:06:56] <span style="color:#000000">CTT: oh ok</span><br />
[08:06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: mostly the lower floors</span><br />
[08:07:05] <span style="color:#000000">CTT: had Ï„o clear someÏ„hing up Ï„here</span><br />
[08:07:11] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: but yeah</span><br />
[08:07:25] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: caelus doesnt even bother being a cool villain</span><br />
[08:07:35] <span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CAE</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
[08:07:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: because the explosion that wrecked DT's hardware kinda broke the housing for some radioactive elements that helped him function.</span><br />
[08:07:45] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: he just sits in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and sends assassins and shit</span><br />
[08:07:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Quantum Computing isn't simple to maintain!</span><br />
[08:08:04] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: you gotta make sure all those electrons spin right, after all.</span><br />
[08:08:07] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: doesnt even bother warping in and giving ominous exposition</span><br />
[08:08:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh please</span><br />
[08:08:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A cool villain usually fails.</span><br />
[08:08:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: here we fuckin go</span><br />
[08:08:46] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[08:08:51] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
[08:08:53] <span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how's it all going</span><br />
[08:08:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A villain who doesn't care, and is genre savvy</span><br />
[08:09:01] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Nox from Wakfu. That is all.</span><br />
[08:09:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: thats what you need to watch out for.</span><br />
[08:09:09] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: oh god yes speak trope names some more</span><br />
[08:09:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I have a better idea.</span><br />
[08:09:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I will post a link.</span><br />
[08:09:58] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: i swear if its just a tvtropes article</span><br />
[08:09:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ho- It seems that would be a "bad" idea</span><br />
[08:10:09] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: according to DT</span><br />
[08:10:11] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
[08:10:19] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yo, FL, are you still having clone issues?</span><br />
[08:10:26] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well now you gotta post it</span><br />
[08:10:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I haven't gone back to my land yet to check</span><br />
[08:10:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but I assume so</span><br />
[08:10:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: please don't kill me.</span><br />
[08:10:45] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Coolio.</span><br />
[08:10:53] <span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: that was not actually the game plan.</span><br />

[08:11:21] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Wait.</span><br />
[08:11:31] <span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Why does FL has clones?</span><br />

[08:11:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: hold on</span><br />
[08:11:51] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: this better be good</span><br />
[08:12:27] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: well its a half-step up from tvtropes articles</span><br />
[08:12:34] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: see why dt didnt want you posting it though</span><br />
[08:13:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
[08:15:29] <span style="color:#887000">CSL: ...maybe hes just trying to lure us into complacency</span><br />
