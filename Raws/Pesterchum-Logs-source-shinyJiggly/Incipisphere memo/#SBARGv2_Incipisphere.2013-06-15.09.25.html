<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just wondering, last night when I was flying the heck away from stuff, I accidentally forgot to give you the thing I snagged out of that pyraxis thing. I can't tell what it's supposed to be for some reason.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think I might have figured that out</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Oh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: keep it</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: still doesn't answer my question on what it's supposed to do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: its a bomb that goes off when its in a certain proximity of my Denizen as well as at a certain heat</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The consorts said such an item should have been found there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: That must be why the Denizen isn't awake</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Well, I guess its time to go down and see what this place is like without all the ice obscuring shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so, SJ. Destroy it or save it incase we can use it for something later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Your safe from it exploding, just to be clear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess this turned out well</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I don't have to fight the Denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and I get to explore my land</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: at this point it doesn't really make since to call it LOCAG</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: I guess so. Some of the books collected yestrday have also proven to be useful in my research. So theres that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I wonder if there are any cave-consorts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: frozen in time</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I can't find my frozen denizen</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Uh... If hes free, and made of gas, there is a chance you might have inhaled a little bit of him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ew</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe he got stuck in the atmosphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe he's awake and he just can't come down</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: also, some consorts have been telling me something interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what are they whispering now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: apparantely, the Denizen's palace is vacant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Which would make since</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because the Denizen is trapped in the atmosphere</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I kind of want to see whats in it, if its not the Denizen</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Careful, there might be an "ink" effect.</span><br />

<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Does it now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: understandable, since he was once the gaurdian of LOCAG history</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL, I doubt that thing is that powerful. At most it'll probably only blow up a room.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I found something on the incipisphere and types of sessions</span><br />

<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: Also true, SE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Glitched Sessions involve when the session has elements missing</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: It also says that Glitched Sessions are more varied</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFL</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so it is really difficult to say how they all work.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but when Key elements fail to occur in a session that don't neccasarilly involve prototyping occur</span><br />
<span style="color:#2934ca">CEQ: great. still up in the air for what could happen. perfect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: god that was semiredundant</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2"> AG: Get a better plot device, then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: So anyway</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: What it does know about Glitched Sessions is that the plot of the game varies extensively</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: such as in the form of the Imposter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hey</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: bh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this isnt getting us very far</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mind looking other places? </span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Sure</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this is just sketchy stuff that we kinda already know</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Glitched sessions are interesting because they only occur after a scratch</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: or atleast... standard ones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: didnt someone say that The Big Bad came back from his session to get us or something? </span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2"> AG: Sounds like the Session Glitch from Homestuck.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i swear i heard someone say that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: This is because Glitched Sessions are one scenario when a scratched session won't fail completely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: would that mean we're the scratched session of The Big Bad?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and hes come back to get us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I dunno</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2"> AG: I've heard that too, SE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: It think it means that we are a scratched session of The Big Bad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: thats what i said</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and the big bad is probabely mad at us because of our session being glitched</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and there for not condemned to failure</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: or maybe hes from the scratched session before us</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm really confused right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and hes trying to get revenge?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: thats what I just said</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: He's mad at us because he survived his session by some means.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and he won't be able to have victory</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: in that he won't be able to claim the Ultimate Reward</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: So he's mad.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: stalemate</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: we cant make the Ulimate Reward</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and he cant claim it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: we can</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or can we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but he isn't in a position to</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Probabely because he's alien to our session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: so I guess his mind set might be:</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: "If I can't claim the Ultimate Reward, then neither can you"</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the beta kids are alien to the alpha kids session too</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but they brought their planets with then</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: which are alien too</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: so</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: that doesnt line up</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but they brought their battlefield to the new one</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: which is also alien</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: being foreign doesnt seem to work</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: something else is stopping him</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: thats another possibility</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: maybe it was a pirated session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: what does that even mean?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: like...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: if it was illegally made.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: the game is older than time and space itself</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dont think it has bootlegged versions</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: yah..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: probabely.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2"> AG: Wait. Do we know who found the original disc/compiled the code for this one?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: But I feel like he's just pissed at us because he can't claim the Ultimate Reward</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Or maybe he's just a sociopath</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: nnnh. .n.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: maybe its a bit more direct than that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: could be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The book is really unspecific for some parts</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: and then other things its REALLY specific for</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: if we are the scratched session that he was originally a part of</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: then maybe hes mad at /us/</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: The encyclopedia also has an index of alchemiter codes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how does that sound to the rest of you guys?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's sorta confusing, but I guess it might sorta make sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i guess?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dont know</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: have any of you ever been able to get onto our battlefield?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: this is as confusing as my quest is right now</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: There might be more for us to investigate there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2"> AG: I'm going to drop out of this discussion so I can use my brainpower to kick ass at this new game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Do we have any void players?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I wonder what Earth looks like now</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: nothing worth seeing</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: lets not think about that</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CEQ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Clio's ability to manage the collection is amazing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: If I put a watch in the shunt do you think it would make a wrist alchemiter?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I want to be able to move the thing somewhere more convenient</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it'll probably do some weird timey thing or attatch a watch to it or something</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: that sucks</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: it would be nice to have a portable alchemiter</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Okay, odd...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I think my Denizen is actually talking to me.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay</span><br />
