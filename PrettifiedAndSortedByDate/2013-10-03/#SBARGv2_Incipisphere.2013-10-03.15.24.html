[03:29:52] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Oh my god.</span><br />
[03:30:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the problem is we are stuck on sidequests</span><br />
[03:30:02] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think I just realized why nothing has been happening.</span><br />
[03:30:07] <span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont think i can get amy on board though, and shes an active participant too</span><br />

[03:31:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you saying we left a mcguffin in some hard-to get place or need to talk to this one guy somewhere and that's locking things up? ➜</span><br />
[03:31:15] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like getting a special ability it's not /required/</span><br />
[03:31:22] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: and unless you actually /do something/ with it it doesn't mean anything</span><br />
[03:31:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm... maybe we should go back and do Part 3 of Fahr Caverns soon...</span><br />

[04:02:44] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (okay, I'll see about tracking LE down sometime)</span><br />
[04:02:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (and see if I can trick the two into killing eachother)</span><br />
[04:04:29] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (that would be crazy dangerous, but might just work) ➜</span><br />
[04:04:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (which is why it wouldn't)</span><br />
[04:05:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (logicly we would need to kill chronos in a way that would /never/ work)</span><br />
[04:06:20] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: (why are we whispering) ➜</span><br />

[04:12:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe</span><br />
