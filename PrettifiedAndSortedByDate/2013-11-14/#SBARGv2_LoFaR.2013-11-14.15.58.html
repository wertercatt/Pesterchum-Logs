<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((still trying to think of an IC reason why I'm here... or something))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  the shadows start leaking from the ball again, looking like they're reaching out for MP. They don't actually exist, but she probably couldn't tell. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  comes in for a landing, hopping off and keeping an eye on the pair from afar. They're just... standing around. With a nice-looking sceptre spear thingy, huh --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  is doing a thing so yes she CAN tell actually. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals in randomly, not sure why, something just told him a thing was happening so idk --</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We were boning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  exhales once, closing her eyes, then the runes light up on the scepter, then all over her left arm, a multitude of black runes burning and carving itself on her skin up to her shoulder, where the tattoo there shifts into something else. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Aw shit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Swear to god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ....I didn't think I'd prefer the other thing but</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Hi Rob ahahaha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: i might prefer the other thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hi Fi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'm kidding I was just ..... what the hell did your arm just do</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: that was creepy</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...the skaian clouds told me to come here, /why/ again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Why the hell is CP here? -finally opens her eyes, black sclera and reddish-purple irises, whoops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: -</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Whoa whoa whoa whaaaat the fuck I didn't sign up for this shit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  glances from MP's arm to the sceptre and then to her eyes and --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  ...blinks. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...What did you /do/...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I am an innocent man</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Envy has a cursed sword.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Scepter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Though that cursed sword of his has the same runes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Are my eyes weird?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: .....Yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Awesome, that means this worked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  goes to yank the spear away from her, blinking somewhere between concern and confusion. Probably both. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /This/?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't even know man</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Spell.</span><br />

<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Envy did I forget to show you that--</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: I forgot to show you. Whoops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  licks her thumb and runs it down her arm, runes immediately vanishing from her skin. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: What the actual hell</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Can someone explain to me just what the /hell's/ going on?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Can someone remove CP from this are?</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: *area</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Empy's into some kinky shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: God NV shut up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Hey Kimmy, s'up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess the cloud was pranking me or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...but seriously, what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  btw has only a tank top on and apparently intricate tribal looking tattoos on her shoulders. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: just go, it's nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeeeeaaaah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  just sort of... doubles back the way he came then --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I was told there was a cool spear to be had.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  tank top on INSTEAD OF HER USUAL JACKET. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ....</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: was I lied to</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: That's a cursed spear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ....................................There's totally a cool spear to be had you've got to see this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  groans and buries her face in her hands --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  glances at NV and the spear. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: We were just taking a break for really kinky stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP]</span>  backs away quietly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT melodiousPsyche's <span style="color:#5c315c">[CMP'S]</span>  eyes has incidentally shifted back to normal btw. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  in his defense, it's actually a really cool looking spear, wrought iron staff with a large top piece somewhat resembling the chitauri scepter but nooot really, golden bits to it as well, There's a black ball in the connection from the staff to the blade, other than that totally radical spear. Looks like there's a tooth sticking out the back of the blade, making it like a little...weird halberd. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  portals back to Prospit, more than a little weirded out seeing MP like that (the spear curse thing, not...) --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That /is/ a cool looking spear.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Cursed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Naaaah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just powerful and broken.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Yeeeeeeeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Watch this!</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">CMP: Oh my god.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT neuroticVagabond <span style="color:#005500">[CNV]</span>  goes over, walking over to the nearest and largest tree he can find, touching the spear to it. It promptly vanishes away into ash, the spear's blade now glowing black and blue creepily. --</span><br />
