<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 THEGRID.</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ...Everyone else is never going to believe this</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: they're just going to think were trolling</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#9d001f">CURRENT rambunctiousSkater [CRS]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: So we're in a computer system remeniscent of a game...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  walks around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: inside of a game</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Inside of another game that effects the state of reality on the whole</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: then again, the amount of Jurassic Parking in the rest of the game (most players' lands being a copy of SOME OTHER game), it's probably not too far-fetched.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: we have to go deeper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT rambunctiousSkater <span style="color:#9d001f">[CRS]</span>  said completely deadpan --</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or, higher, maybe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: we should play one of the grid games</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What's to say Sbarg isn't another virtual reality? I wonder...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT powerKitten <span style="color:#55aa00">[CPK]</span>  goes to a disc court --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: actually RS, the only way deeper than this is to install Sbarg on this grid's "User world"...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I wonder whos computer this is</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: five boondollars says it's either Ornis' computer or Chronos'.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Wait i just relized something</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Ornis is going to be pissed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Because like what if we fuck up the session even more</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Eh</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We won't, jeez.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Let's just look around, see if there's anything amiss, any bugs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Guys, dont derezz any programs</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I think Green means bugs, right Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: or shit would get fucking crappy</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I only read the tropes page, never played 2.0</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Or Evolution.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I havent played any tron games</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: so im in the dark</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: green cracked lines are Corrupted Programs, yes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: But if there's one handy thing about The Grid its everything's color-coded</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Limit of my tron knowlage is whats presented in Uprising</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and from the fact that my land was infested with green corruption in Curse Zone form, I can pretty much smell that stuff from a distance...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ("was" being the operative word, I fixed the problem a while ago)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: try not to act susspious</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: There is no way to get past amnessia</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hm?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I tried to view my memories that i forgot due to my amnessia</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: and my disc cant view them due to "curruption"</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Guys is the occupation dangerous?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Too users i mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Occupation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Raz, i thought you watched Uprising</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: corruption? well, technically yes. Thorne was the SOURCE of the corruption in 2.0, because of a botched digitization.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Oh, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: No the Occupation</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Wait, you mean this is The Grid circa-that period?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I dont know</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: Maybe</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is this /the/ Grid, like will we run into Clu's forces, and such? Ay...If that happens it'll be trouble.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: I dont know</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The last thing we need to do is draw attention, regardless. Can you like, shift into human form for at least a little Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: It appears like they copied the grid, and like Sbargv2'd it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hmm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CPK: because i see sbargv2 looking programs</span><br />
