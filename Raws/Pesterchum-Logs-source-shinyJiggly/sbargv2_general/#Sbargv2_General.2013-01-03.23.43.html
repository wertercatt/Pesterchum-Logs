<span style="color:#3a4961">CAE: ??</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: then again, I might forget eventually</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: why is this happening</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I honestly have no idea what I was or will be doing here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: i am surrounded by idiots</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: meh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I wonder if this is supposed to be like in the Back To The Future movies where coming in contact with yourself from another time apparently asplodes the universe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: then homestuck wouldn't work</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: yeah, wrong time mechanics.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey, I know you were thinking about that one too! or at least maybe later or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: man, you're taking quite a long time to think of something to type.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: You do this sort of stuff too! and I know it because it's a havit I've always had and always will have.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *habit</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: and of course, your dumb little typos. What, going to blame it on the laptop keyboard again, are we?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: mistakes are inevitable. You know that as well as I do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: man, you're in a pessemistic mood tonight.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: hey look, I think we scared everyone off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: ywa</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: yes</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: you did</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Good job, doofus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: it's not your fault</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: it's your fault</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: which one of us?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ:  <img src='smilies/mspa_face.gif' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I kinda have a point there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kind of, but not really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: Electivire is such a cool pokemon</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: if you wanna be factual, it would be both.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: &lt;_&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: meh, whatever. I'm tired of this. Maybe next week I'll know what I'm doing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that was me, from last week?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then how come I don't remember squat about this?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and why couldn't I had just warned myself about that problem with bulbapedia?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sigh...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: freaking timeloops.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ:  <img src='smilies/pc_rancorous.gif' alt=':rancorous:' title=':rancorous:' /></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: maybe you don't remember because you'd fallen asleep before the conversation began?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: harder to remember things when you've just woken up...</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF:  <a href='http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Electivire'>http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Electivire</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: look at this majestic fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: i still think elekid is cooler</span><br />
<span style="color:#55007f">CGF: i wonder if there is a elekid toy</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA:  <a href='http://alexlaughingalonewithpuppets.tumblr.com/post/39650379205/milesjai-hello-windows-windows-xp-startup'>http://alexlaughingalonewithpuppets.tumblr.com/post/39650379205/milesjai-hello-windows-windows-xp-startup</a></span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: this is neat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: and why the hell are you still even awake? let alone sharing tumblr posts?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ...can you just... stop talking... please</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: why</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: fond memories of xp... </span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: because i don't want to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: oh whoops, looks like i gotta be elsewhere.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">?MA: laters.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: seeya</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: ... i really hope i don't ever involve myself in time shenanigans ever again</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: not counting whenever that apparently happened</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: welp... i'm gonna attempt to sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000c1">CMA: just gonna idle here</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: goodnight</span><br />
