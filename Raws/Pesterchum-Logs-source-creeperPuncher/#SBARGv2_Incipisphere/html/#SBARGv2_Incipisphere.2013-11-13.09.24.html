<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … On the Euclidean plane, it's impossible. An internal angle is 3pi/5 and not a divisor of 2pi.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: well...maybe the entire floor was based off of five sided tiles</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: "standard" pentagons can't tile. but if they're distorted into, say, a house shape (still five sides technically), they would tile.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, pentagons that aren't equilateral can tile fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#dba521">CMV: if you've ever layed down tile you'd know you could pretty easily do five sided tiles</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Okay, its just they were perfect, same length on everyside..</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: The magicant is /weird/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Then they shouldn't be able to tile in a Euclid-- OH</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The /Magicant/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...and you're just figuring that out now, DJ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yeah, non-Euclidean geometry functions there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: FL has me on a mapping project, he says he will help later, but yeah, the magicant /is/ pretty messed up.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Also, my camera exploded when I tried to take a picture.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: snrk</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Like, the tiny camera just went up in smoke!</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Non-Euclidean geometry.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Like a hyperbolic plane.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...In english?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: And don't say "because the place is fucked up"</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Space doesn't work right there.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: /sigh/</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Euclidean is "normal" geometry. How things fit right here. Non-Euclidean is when you have hyperbolic planes.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: what is a hyperboltic plane?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: bloic*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: bolic*</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: To quote directly from Wikipedia about this, as it words it better than I do, the difference between the geometries is as follows...</span><br />
AG: "The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement that, in two-dimensional space, for any given line R and point P not on R, there is exactly one line through P that does not intersect R; i.e., that is parallel to R. In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through P which do not intersect R, so the parallel postulate is false."<br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … More than one line can go through the same space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Oh, okay!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I don't know how to explain it to you really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: The Magicant is just spacefucked.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: It looks kinda normal to me, but its weird.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Its kinda wavy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: Oh well, gotta go!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffc080">CDJ: I'll post the link one more time since Gambit might wanna look at it!</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: How everyone doing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Decent.</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay at the moment ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Good, I guess... guess the others are AFK</span><br />

<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, found the beginning of the magicant map sam was working on, might as well add to it.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Stupid Land of Water and Webs...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura can likely fix it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Can the fix-it felix hammer it, or something?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: he can scribble in the broken area like in Okami.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But it /looks/ better!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I also noticed that two of the coins in the lobby were missing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...coins?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Gambit, did you take the coins?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: From where?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The copy of Peachs Castle in the magicant... you know, in the main entrance area!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh. uh... yeah, we saw those.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Your "main entrance area" and mine?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: are nowhere near each other</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: main entrance of the castle ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Main entrance in /the game/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: :?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: That the castle is originally from.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I don't even know what Peach's Castle is.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The one with the sun carpet.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So you... have never played Super Mario 64.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Never heard of it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /DAMMIT/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I am a disapoint.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: She can quote near every work of the bard I'm pretty sure but doesn't know about SM64</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: My priorities are as straight as I am!</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...FL, Gambit doesn't knwo lot bout gamer culture. that, and I never played the game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: FL, remember? AG isn't versed in most video games? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :|</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Gambit, that... thats makes no sense. you are not straight... I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, who took the coins?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Exactly! ^^</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You could have at /least/ taken the coins on the other side of the stairs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: ...If straight is het and... curved, presumably, is homo what's</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: instead of just the two on the left.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: What's Bi?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: A SQUIGGLE</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: /hahaha./</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: like a curved line going in a straight line</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ~</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: can't you just like, move one of the coins over or something? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: or are they still in roflcopter mode? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... well, I know SJ knocked one of the right coins off, and I knocked over /and captchaed/ one of the left ones... did you need it back, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...thats you, alight, Gambit. A ~.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: nope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I tossed mine pretty soon after finding out it didn't have healing properties ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: No, not really, It just doesn't match now.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I am a Gordian knot.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gambit, you should watch Chugga's LP of 64 DS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: ...thats the thing that Alexander the Great cut, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Why should I?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: gambit you need to video games</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: No I don't.</span><br />
