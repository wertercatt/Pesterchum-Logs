<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I'm not even a citizen of Neon or PA's Empyre.</span><br />

<span style="color:#225604">CCP: gramps is leaving our house for eight hours a day every day</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: and we don't know why</span><br />
<span style="color:#225604">CCP: because he usually lives a pretty sedimentary lifestyle</span><br />

<span style="color:#4ce6e6">CCS: Perhaps it would be most conveniant to your pursuit of knowledge to follow him</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((that's because "those who write the rules" aren't even on most of the time and I keep forgetting too many rules))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and I forget to enforce them....))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and now the skypers are gonna complain again...))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((this is why I REALLY WISH there was someone as picky as them that actually cared))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I mean, they wouldn't have the rings since both of those have likely been taken care of off screen. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: (( what about the consorts? ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((so as long as we don't tell them, and don't mention anything on the one day every other week Ash is in the memos, we're fine.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((but unmentioned things eventually make it into plot which make it onto the front page))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and consorts were brought through the door just fine. one of the moons is a consort nation.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((consorts are fine))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((yeah, that's pretty much how it went))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((and the mini-tumblr thing probably comes from the fact that the blogs within v2 canon are tumblr-based))</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((then again, i'm not even sure if it can even be called grist anymore, considering there are no ways to earn grist during the postgame))</span><br />
