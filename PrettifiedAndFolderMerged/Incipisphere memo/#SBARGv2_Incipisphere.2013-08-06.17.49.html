<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: I'd buy the jelly thing *nods*</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: I liked it better than NV, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: For a mild concussion? Probably just an hour. At worst, a day. So no overdramatic OH, MY MEMORIES...WHO AM I...WHAT'S MY PURPOSE...! </span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: For more than a day</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Hehe, I can buy that theory too Anna.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How severe would you say the concussion is? Scale of 1 to 100. 100 being "Her brain is literally about to explode out of her skull"</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: ...AG is it weird to you that our text colours are so close?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Are they? I hadn't noticed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: Yup. Super close.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...I thought AG said that first line..</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … 79,184,132 versus 99,167,144.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Huh, you're right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...But didn't question that AG was talking to herself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Ahahahahaha</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: hehehehehehe</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: ... I like how you would expect me to know the answer to that question</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Well, uh… I got nothin' there. *shrugs*</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Wait, are you talking to her?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: You'd know from how much blood is escaping her skull, I'd think</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Don't worry, I know a test for this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: How bad does she think her head is</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Yo, /FS/. You got an answer yet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ..I'll take your silence to mean it's fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Perfect timing for our mutual patience to run out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Fine or he's too wrapped up in her to remember we exist. But yeah, haha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: Heh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: It has officially been too long.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: my apologies I still have not gotten the explicit answer</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Have you gotten /any/ answer?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: initially she had scaled it down to between 1 and 10</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: and declared seven</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Again</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: 1</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: to 100</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: which I suppose would equate to 70 perhaps</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Could she put it on a scale of 1 to 6?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: the aliens of the not-parenthesis seemed to agree somewhat</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: She's seeing aliens? Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Well</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I'd say that's a strange thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: What?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: No, the aliens are real.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: They talk sometimes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Weird</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I decree her amnesia should not last more than 7 days at the worst.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Since she's not sneezing out brain fluid, I'm going to assume it's not bad enough to actually be harmful to her.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Though if this is a normal concussion, she shouldn't really remember anything</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So just throw her in her house with a bunch of shiny objects, and she won't know what happened 7 days later.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: who tosted me? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *toasted ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Shiny, SJ.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: You still have that as a toast for some reason. Around us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: aaagh @ _@ ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: and now even if I had wanted to I do not think I would be able to bring myself to sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: this is a good thing, really</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: huzzah</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Dude. Sleep sucks. Avoid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Don't listen to Gambit</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Unless you're afraid of I don't know, resting</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: No; the nightmares that come with it, on the other hand…</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Boo hoo nightmares oh no</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: FS don't let her sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Freddy Kreuger might get her!</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Aaaaah!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: let her sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: do not let her sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: good graciousness man make up your mind</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: I think he was being sarcastic</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#29486d">CURRENT avoidantCorrespondent [CAC]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#29486d">CAC: FS, he is joking. let her sleep, please..</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: she will be going to sleep</span><br />
<span style="color:#2a0046">CFS: there</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Good</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Another success for...ENVY....SUPER DOCTOR...</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: Are you actually a doctor?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Am I actually a doctor, HAH.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I have a theoretical DEGREE in medicine!</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: some kinda doctor at least :b ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: theoretical</span><br />
