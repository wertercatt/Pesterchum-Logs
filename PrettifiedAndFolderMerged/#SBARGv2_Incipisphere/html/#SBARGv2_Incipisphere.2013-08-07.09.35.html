<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: The spring water is reknowned for its soothing properties by my consorts, so typically my Denizen had to be a big jerk about it and block off all of them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b3b3b3">CPA: My quest, insofar as I can tell, is removing the obstructions and returning the springs on the surface to full capacity. And presumably lighting the forge at some point, perhaps to give them the steam for maximum comfort?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Lighting the forge? What's your aspect? Also I can see why the caverns and caves would help in that quest</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, the only way a Player of Space can end up with a land that doesn't have Frogs in the name is if someone /actively modified the game data while land generation was running/.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, its possible for a Space player to get a natural Frogs land and have the second aspect be replaced by frogs.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So I mean, if he's pissed I wouldn't really hold it against him.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( it wasn't DT in the concept so you know. ))</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: ((well dang))</span><br />

<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...Though, this does spark an interesting dilemma.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Am I a part of your session's code?</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: I would think so...</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: And even if not, could I still be affected by the destruction of the session by... what do you call it, revelation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm going on the assumption that anything within the session boundary counts as "part of the code"...</span><br />

<span style="color:#955311">CSB: indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I would run, but I would assume that abandoning another session do die would make my next death "just".</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how do we even know that it would work?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: wouldn't the game prevent shit like that on account of it already having the scratch as a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: The Scratch is a clean reset.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I mean what I said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: This is like if you took the disc for your session, like, the entire session, and threw it in a microwave.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: According to... someone or other, there were apparently 2 scratches already</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I seriously cannot remember who baited us with that if it wasn't Daedalus.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Just one. And it wasn't /really/ a scratch in the typical sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: hm</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Are you here to just call me an idiot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: He said there were a bunch of sessions. I have vague memories of going on after the Scratch to play a different session, with a different group of people...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like, a branch-off. I have no idea how /entire sessions/ really branch out, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...Anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: I assume that comment was ment as a question, but I'm not sure.</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...You wouldn't accept returning back to life as usual?</span><br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Like everyone else?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...I was afraid of dying. I still am.</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I mean hell I've probably died twice by that logic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...I realized halfway through that the only choice would be Scratching.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: I don't remember shit but HEEEEY maybe I just never joined. Or maybe I'm not a universal constant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: ...Or maybe Empy's sick twisted joke has validity..</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: No I...I remember, that people wondered how we could get rid of a guy from a universe we were supposed to create</span><br />
<span style="color:#5c315c">?MP: What joke did I make, now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...I came because I am not going to let anyone die because I didn't do anything.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: The Denizen family one</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: How killing his universe before it had a chance to become, well, his universe, would do anything but dump us on a one-way track to doomed timeline.</span><br />

<span style="color:#802020">CFL: Will you, FL?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...alright, fine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I disconnected DT after he went behind my back and tryed to prevent Ash from talking to me, he took it the wrong way, used the backup power supply he installed into himself, and flew off with two drones.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The drone he transfered into took the brain scan I just made to check DT with, discovering that he was based on a period of time when my dreamself was still alive, alchemized a copy of Revelation 4.13, and flew into the jamming field.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4fb884">CIA: Someone's learning the Quarian/Geth problem the hard way it looks like</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The other drone was remote controlled to make the satelite that makes the jamming field, and send it back in time using the sendificators in the veil.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And he has adapted his code to be running around a picture of a certain shipping wall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Seriously, he is having code pointers point at code pointers IN THE image.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And we can't take out the satelite, as he will activate revelation if we do.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: o_O; ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … What's Revelation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Best case scenario, it wipes out all the computers in the session and we can alchemize more.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Worse case, it gets into the fundamental code of the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: So basically the ending of ME3 or some wacked out shite</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Also hey Niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: uh erm</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, any plans for how to safely stop DT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Our current plan to stop DT is to go into the jamming field and talk him out of this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span>whats going on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: If he's cyberwarfaring, I'm just saying, other AIs could fight the program or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#802020">CFL: ...and if that doesn't work, take him behind the shed and shoot him between the eyes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: idefk what this program /is/, so.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Its a possibility, AG...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, mind explaining? you do it much better than me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: But considering that I don't know the location of said AI, it would be very difficult, and would take /way/ too much time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Other AI's could help, but still.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...basically, if DT activates Revelation, and it gets into Sburb's source code, THIS ENTIRE MOTHERBARKING SESSION WILL SELF-DESTRUCT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: A jamming feild is a good place to hide from a computer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's all there is to say that hasn't already been said.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...The jamming field is off center from the south pole.</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: Well, the others seem to know where the jamming field is, and… what's it jam, anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Also. /Why does Revelation exist/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: CP, mind explaining its role in uplink?</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: <span style="color:#00ff00">...</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh right, explaining /that/. in Uplink, Revelation is a virus that is meant to destroy the internet by infecting computers and, well, making them self-aware and then self-destruct.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: Can't we have one day without shinaigains?</span><br />
<span style="color:#005500">CNV: Just one day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FF, /WE TRIED/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#955311">CSB: Saddly, no...</span><br />
<span style="color:#63a790">CAG: … Jesus fuck. Why do /you/ have Revelation?</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: YOU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: DO.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: anyway, the program can be stopped with the Faith antivirus, but if Revelation is a higher version, Faith can't do shit.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm not exactly sure what DT has made defense wise.</span><br />

<span style="color:#aaaa7f">CFF: I don't give a fuck. I have a Bazokka that shoots expolsions.</span><br />
