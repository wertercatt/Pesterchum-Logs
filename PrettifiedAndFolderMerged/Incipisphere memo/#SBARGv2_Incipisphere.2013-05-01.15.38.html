<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Anyways.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Yeah as CP so eloquently put, this entire game could be classified as magic of a sort.</span><br />

<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Huh.. nice RS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: The question then becoming to what extent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Aspects and classes serve to guide the the extent to which we might use "magic", as we'll define it for the sake of simplicity</span><br />
<span style="color:#a8a87e">CFF: Da.</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: But then farther still go the abilities alchemized items might grant us, or even outside forces like the clouds that allow us glimpses of the future, or the creatures that might open our minds to things best left unpondered...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Which is, while interesting, getting wildly off topic</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Back to the question at hand which I assure does in fact exist...</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: What "Magic" allows you to animate the inanimate?</span><br />
<span style="color:#970025">CRS: Is it the same magic that grants you flight?</span><br />

<span style="color:#005500">CCP: RS: well, going back to a "the world is code" analogy, animating the inanimate would theoretically be as simple as data type conversion; for example, casting EntityPlushThing (extends Entity) to EntityLivingPlushThing (extends EntityLiving, itself an Entity subclass)</span><br />
