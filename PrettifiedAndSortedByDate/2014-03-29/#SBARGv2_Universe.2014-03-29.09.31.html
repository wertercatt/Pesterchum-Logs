[09:51] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: for petes sake</span><br />
[09:51] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: as much as i like the talking, i dont like the annoying arguing</span><br />
[09:51] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: so please</span><br />
[09:51] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: take this somewhere else if you need to</span><br />

[09:52] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: then sorta but no</span><br />
[09:52] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: there are plenty of things who will grant a "wish" for some price</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: but the wish is just fufilled by some strings and whisles, nothing much</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: so basically its a scam</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...So no wishes that can bring her back.</span><br />
[09:53] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: nΘt th▲t bringing her b▲ck will help yΘu in ▲ny w▲y.</span><br />

[09:54] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: maybe there is a person or race out there with that sorta tec. however, as far as i know, dead tend to stay dead, and i like it that way.</span><br />
[09:54] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: which is why the lot of you annoy me</span><br />
[09:54] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: thinking you can just cheat the system like that</span><br />
[09:54] <span style="color:#000000">CWD: which eventu▲lly cΘmes b▲ck when yΘu kill ▲nΘther thing yΘu deem "c▲ncerΘus"</span><br />

[09:58] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: oy i kinda take offence to that upon reflection- uh</span><br />
[09:58] <span style="color:#716604">CNL: i know little about souls. i myself dont even have one so</span><br />

[04:41] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Anyways, she could take a hit quite well, but she still backed off when I went for the eyes.</span><br />

[04:42] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: Maybe. I also hooked her nose so she would get off of me, and it did seem to effect her.</span><br />
[04:42] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Which I thought was a dead language</span><br />
[04:43] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...</span><br />

[04:43] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: since you obviously aren;t taking her seriously.</span><br />
[04:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: No because I understand that's an incredibly stupid idea Charles, we've seen her take a massive laser to the back and shrug it off</span><br />
[04:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: and seen her pick up and throw a nuclear bomb</span><br />
[04:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: But a laser isn't solid matter.</span><br />
[04:44] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Jovin is telling us the most basic attack ever might work and that's actually helpful</span><br />
[04:45] <span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: But here's the thing- she KNOWS thats her weakness, I think.</span><br />

[04:51] <span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: The fact that you can't concieve a punch having more power than a cannonball is pretty goddamn telling in that regard.</span><br />

[06:31] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...If a magical girl got hit by a potion of gender bending, what would happen?</span><br />

[06:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: More like magical men</span><br />
[06:35] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: i don't think this grief seed will summon kyubey or nothing</span><br />

[06:49] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Oh, right.</span><br />
[06:49] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I concider ignoring a perfectly valid point, turning it back upon the one who made it, and then ignoring his reminder of a part of a deal to be exceptionally rude</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...assuming near the town square...</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: Probably Kim</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: And I started no smear campaign</span><br />
[06:50] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And okay so after that holobaoth incident I was still digesting all that information and I came to the conclusion I wouldn't feel right fighting somebody like that</span><br />

[06:53] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: it doesn't matter in anycase. You just admitted to saying something that you just said that you did not</span><br />

[06:55] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and not onlty that</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: And you followed that line of thinking all the way to death threats against somebody who was barely turning the idea of being unable to fight her.</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: but not 10 comments ago you stated that you only said that would would not fight her</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and not what i've been saying that you had</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and yet you just admitted it</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#c8382d">CVS: so how about them red socks</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: I get that you're from the usual suspects and are probably not very bright nor quick on the draw, but let me get this in your head.</span><br />

[06:57] <span style="color:#005500">CNV: In an argument, mind you, taking her side in an argument if this were an objective debate</span><br />

[06:57] <span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: you can not fault me on that</span><br />
