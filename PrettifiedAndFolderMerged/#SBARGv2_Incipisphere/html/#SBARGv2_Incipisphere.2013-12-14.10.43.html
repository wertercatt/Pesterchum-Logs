[05:35:46] <span style="color:#c6b608">CNL: you... could have just built them some metalic ones... instead of going to all that trouble?</span><br />
[05:35:58] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: only the best</span><br />
[05:37:03] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: plus we needed them to be players</span><br />
