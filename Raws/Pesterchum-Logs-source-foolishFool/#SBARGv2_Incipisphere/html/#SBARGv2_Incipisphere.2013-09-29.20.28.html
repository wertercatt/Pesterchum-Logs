<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I have the funniest feeling</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but you dont walk in and go "hi everybody, i have a death laser"</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That your reasoning will only make it /worse/</span><br />

<span style="color:#000000">CTT: No fucking deaτh lasers aimed aτ my house</span><br />

DS: I know I was not on the best terms with everyone, and I wanted to insure my relative safety<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i understand his reasoning for /having/ it</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: D_S ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you're putting yourself on worse terms.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: you dont bring it up as soon as you walk in</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: you failed to show us that you trust us.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: speaking of Death Lasers, if PK comes on, tell her I EMP'd the haywire one in orbit around LoCaL so it wouldn't destroy her land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and aren't you supposed to be a /Mage/ of Blood?</span><br />

<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: next point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: ▲nd you pracτically lied on whaτ your charisma sτaτ /really/ is like.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: RS, could I have your attention for a moment?</span><br />
DS: yes<br />
DS: ((that sheet isn't canon, I messed up and haven't fixed it))<br />

<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah, what's up?</span><br />

((I will when I feel like it))<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: that said, i do thinkk theres another angle to this</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((wouldn't it makes sense for your char to be able to mess up a player sheet?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I understand that you wish to be a leader sort. If you /really/ wanna. You gotta learn not to take personal matters into things. While I understand that AE was heckling you a fair bit, you drew yourself into that far to much. </span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: which is that /ds felt that he needed to have a death cannon pointed at the hq/</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what does that fucking say about us</span><br />
DS: we don't trust each other<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: bullshit.</span><br />
DS: and I'll openly admit that<br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well, it's more like you have trust issues ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think thats really disturbing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: since you were the guy with the cannon in the first place ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#00aefe">CAH: The fact that you are able to aquire death lasers and point it at HQ's very easilly? And thats bad?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: how many people in this room are capable and have trust me with their lives in the past?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and the blame cant be placed entirely on ds</span><br />
DS: yeah i have trust issues<br />
DS: I'm fucking paranoid<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: everybody rushes to blame ds's trust issues because we dont want to admit that /we made it difficult for him to trust us/</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: though it seems that it creates these stupid self-fulfilling prophesies ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: okay SL. let's play your angle for a second.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: DS what is it that drove you to decide that was a good idea?</span><br />
DS: ummm<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Take your time. I want a thorough answer.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont be scared to be honest either</span><br />
DS: the fact that at least two people in the room have expressed desire to kill me in the past?<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because im almost certainly going to white knight the hell out of you</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Would you kindly keep quiet?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: alright</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Thank you.</span><br />
DS: I've died twice before. Not fun experiences<br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I'm gone eating pizza for ten minutes and wat.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Alright. Now DS. If you /truly/ believed that they held an actual intent to kill you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Where in the line of sense and logic does it lie to aim a large laser at a high center of players. Not only do you endanger yourself and others but you may force their hand, if they actually wished to kill you.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ok im sorry but youre changing the subject and hoping no one notices</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: the question is not if ds made a good decision</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because he fucking didnt</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SL.</span><br />
DS: yeah, I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to give ADD kid the capability to make a death laser<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but whether the fact that said decision was made reflects on us</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'm asking him to think it through and realize why he /shouldn't/</span><br />
DS: ADD kid doesn't think things through<br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: because τhis game doesn'τ seτ limiτs depending on cerτain people???</span><br />
DS: and may I remind you<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also ds dont play the mental disability card</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: and we can'τ babysiτ you S4/7</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000">CTT: *τwenτy-four*</span><br />
DS: when TT asked me to remove it<br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: speaking as someone with autism its just a shitty thing to do</span><br />
DS: I did<br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I blame nothing on my PTSD. </span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: And that's fine. </span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but the point is we need to think about the fact that we created an atmosphere where the thought of pulling a mutually assured destruction card even came into his head</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: SL.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: We've estabilshed that two people have stated their wish to kill them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and thats a big fucking deal</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: especially since, in an ideal world, he would be able to say "well if either of them try there are enough people that they can stop him or her"</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and why wouldnt he?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: every time he comes on the memo theres this atmosphere of hostility</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: You're speaking for him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: I'll ask you to stop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm wondering why I even absconded to his ship during the evactuation. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: well hes gone now so he cant speak for himself</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: So speaking for him to push your own agenda is what makes sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what agenda</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: What a lovely politician you would have made.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: yeah, i got that a lot</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Your agenda is that you believe to see something wrong in that we project a "atmosphere of hostility" and you wish to change this.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You said you would white knight the shit out of him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: because /no one else will/</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: every time he says or does anything everyone gives him shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's the defining attribute of a white kngiht, isn't it? Caring more about the abstract cause then the person in question?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: Mhm. You just want to push what you want to say, and he's your center piece. Whether he wants it or not, you just want to get your idea through.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: It's selfish.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: if my agenda is making it so people can feel safe interacting with other players, then i fully embrace that agenda</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i had to step in, because you werent giving him a chance to really speak</span><br />
