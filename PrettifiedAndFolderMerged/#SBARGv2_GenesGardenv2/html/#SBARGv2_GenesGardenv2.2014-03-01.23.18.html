[12:22:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or maybe the tree was already there and just recently bloomed.</span><br />

[12:32:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: okay FL, let me put it this way. if both Lifers we know that are still around won't help us... then we'll wait and see if anything happens with the tree.</span><br />

[12:34:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Some sort of sky block map.</span><br />

[12:37:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Flatgrass Map with generate structures on.</span><br />

[12:38:50] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, we probably should resume doing minecraft at some point...</span><br />

[12:44:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, dangit.</span><br />
[12:48:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Maybe we could play doom?</span><br />
[12:50:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess that's a thing that's possible... considering how well SRB2 worked once I got the ports aligned correctly...</span><br />
[12:52:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I wish we had some other people that practiced magic.</span><br />
[12:56:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hey, Kimura.</span><br />

[12:59:13] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Connecting them.</span><br />

[01:00:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Hold on, I just thought of an exploit.</span><br />
[01:00:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. I learned them about the same time as my custom techniques like Waterbomb.</span><br />
[01:03:34] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Okay, but I would need to keep it moving some how...</span><br />
[01:04:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: How long does it last?</span><br />
[01:04:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh... until the two objects are next to each other, or as close as they can get if there's an obstruction like a wall.</span><br />
[01:05:12] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh, so the magnetism doesn't stay that way... dammit.</span><br />
[01:05:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, fraid so. what were you thinking of trying?</span><br />
[01:05:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Using Magnetism to power an electrical generator.</span><br />

[01:13:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Always found them in pairs.</span><br />
[01:15:57] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I guess that's logical. like matter-antimatter particle pairs at the event horizon of a black hole, or something like that?</span><br />

[01:38:14] <span style="color:#8f8b12">CSB: Personally, I'd say the earthquakes are more important than the tree.</span><br />
[01:38:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What came first?</span><br />
[01:39:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The quakes, or the tree?</span><br />

[01:39:33] <span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  was about to do a "YOU'VE GOT THAT WRONG!" pose if FL blamed the tree for the quakes, but nvm :P --</span><br />

[01:41:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[01:41:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Kimura, it makes sense when you treat events as if they were happening in a movie, book, or video game.</span><br />
[01:42:15] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I suppose so...</span><br />
[01:42:23] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but what would she have to do with the tree?</span><br />
[01:42:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Life powers, Touhou references...</span><br />

[01:45:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Heck, one is the namesake of the seventh game in the series.</span><br />
[01:45:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: still, considering the Starterquakes have been going on for a month and the tree only appeared a week ago, the latter is definitely not the cause of the former.</span><br />

[01:46:26] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And it would be likely she would make a giant cherry blossom as a reference.</span><br />
