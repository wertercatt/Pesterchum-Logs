<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 so maybe I could convince my friends to play :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 but if I could, tehy'd already be here wouldnt tehy... :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: could be the time scaling</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 or tehir entries are fartehr down teh line :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: maybe...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: delayed entry, out of contact, there's all sorts of reasons they could have not contacted yet. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah, I've gotten it down to a science, the delayed entry</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: they will /always/ enter at the time of day they left...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: however, every hour of entry equals a month here.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 because bullshit :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, someone who entered 2 hours after the first entry, would enter 2 months into the session.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but the /time/ they show up /here/ would be equal to the time of day.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 So possibly ive already saved tehm but tehy havent showed up yet because of that :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: maybe you didn</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: didn't /need/ to.</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 unfurtantly I have no way of knowing until eitehr I fo or tehy show up :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#12bc00">CPK: :3 *go :3</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and this time thing spreads into the /minutes...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think i did my math wrong, hold on</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ah, right.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: every two hours equals a month here</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and that splits into minutes lining up with days</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so people that entered 24 hours late would get here a YEAR later? O_O</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CMP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: but by then, most of the world would have been wrecked, so those would likely be the last entries.</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...so, what is the time setting on the V2 Blog again?</span><br />
