<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: sounds interesting</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: aaaAnd there we go.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Interesting, yes. Pleasent to go through, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah basically</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: &gt;:[</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: You might want to begin grinding on your Land Quest though, meeting your consorts, documenting your experiences, alchemizing stuff, and reporting any bugs you come across though</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: As I understand it, Tumblr is widely used for this purpose still</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Indeed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: So just follow the giant ice sculpted road?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably your best bet</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I guess the consorts did that</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: But its REALLY long.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or land gen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: BH, what's your land name? probably Land of Snow and Something...</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Documenting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Ha.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: Land of Clouds and Glaciers</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Land of Snow/Frost/Cold/Glaciers/Ice/Christmas</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: aha, glaciers</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: man this road is really nice</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Well, greetings to LOCAG from the Land of Ghosts ad Mirrors!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 18 people now...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: its like they put months of work into it</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: My land is LoSaCR, for Land of Steam and Crossroads.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: its got carvings of frogs as well as this wierd serpent thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: YOur lands sound way more interesting than mine</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: what is this serpent thing?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: What's your aspect?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: If I didn't know any better i'd say it looks like the symbol for my web browser</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Oh, that. You'll most likely see the "serpent thing" in a bit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: my aspect is space</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: mine's LoSaCy, Land of Snow and Crystal</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd"><span style="color:#000000">CFI</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Is it really her...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nico had her already, though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Can't be, unless the game glitched even more than we thought</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: A different flavor yeah but I figured these things were one-off...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: No idea what that means</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: three of us have the LOSAC landcronym, so we suffix it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: My bro, Nico, he's another Space guy. Echidna's his Denizen.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: or just use a separate land nickname, like mine is Fahr Caverns and FL's is... oh frogs, I forgot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: it looks like the browser icon for Clio</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and the piratepad is still deadtier))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((use the code you got from the enter flash into the aspect puzzle page to get a "legit" aspect, but usually space players have to have frogs in their land name))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but that is way to coincidental</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: *cough*Sunset Park Zone*cough*</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ((I didn't understand that and just ended up coming up with it myself))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ((If its any concellation, it has frog carvings and sculptures on the road</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (oh right)</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: uh</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: hey guys</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: yes?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: ?</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i seem to have a bit of a gristy problem</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: How so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Take mine.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: what kind?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Except for the Mystic Crystal kind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: mostly build</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: and obsidian i think</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: just use torrent</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I crushed a imp hoard with my house</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: i dont have torrent</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: but doesnt that only link to the other players in your chain?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, gristTorrent is global to the entire session</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I don't know</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: oh, in that case you should download it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, Gates are not a thing that currently exists because of Bakagami's rampage.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: unless your using it to get a computer, than your pretty much screwed</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hence why we all have to fly, warp, or transportalize between lands.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Wait, Voldemort fucked our gates? What'd he /do/ to 'em?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: blewτhemup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: left or right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: inτhewholespriτecaτasτrophe</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: He fucked us and in doing so he fucked them up to the breaking point</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ..........</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Let us chalk this up to just another of the vile actions that that bastard will pay for in the end</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: ... Welp.</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: One of the many...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: shit</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: right was wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: where would i find grist torrent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Make it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: just get it from a furthest ring server</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: or did those get destroyed to?</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: It should be fairly simple to find.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: its fine</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: ag is sending me a copy</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: Ah, good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Brilliant.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: if there are more of those forks in the road I am going to be really annoyed</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: And get yourself a strife specibus as fast as possible</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, sooner or later you'll hit a consort village, and then they'll be able to tell you where to go for things.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I already have two.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Any will do, doesn't matter how crappy you are with it at first</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: oh? which two?</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Which ones?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: cuestickkind and riflekind</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (( /me just realized there are FOUR players that all have almost the same shade of red text ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: (( Pff-))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((isn't one of them))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((swag((</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: I kind of put holes in the imps</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...cuestickKind? first time I've heard of that being used.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: That's inovative.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Riflekind is UP in this game</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Shit let's be Venom.</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Trust me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: because I prototyped an animal I shot holes into</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: What /does/ everyone use? I've got cardKind.</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: laserKind</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: EpeeKind</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: i really hope none of you have trypophobia when we face the king</span><br />
<span style="color:#55aa00">CSE: laser pointers gone crazy</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: I mostly use spearKind, but have crossbowKind as a backup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: which reminds me</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: cardKind?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: brushKind, and I gained reflectorKind when I self-protoed (but technically the specific weapon is keytoolKind)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: since we have so many prototypings what does our battle field look like?</span><br />
DL: keyKind. It's fun.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: keyblade</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: Wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#969619">CEU: wait</span><br />
<span style="color:#4f26ca">CEQ: ... well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: kingdom  hearts</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Phew, shame you didn't show up earlier, you could've been a part of gettin' one of those tarots.</span><br />
IP: bladeKind or whipKind!<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: but really</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">CBH: what does the battlefield look like</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Night.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Tarots? Ha! I've got an entire deck of those xD</span><br />
