<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yes, yes he did.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Also, I may have gotten in contact with a version of Jade but lost connection.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You can see the log on tumblr.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you mean that one that apparently busted into the bacafe a couple weeks back?</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I noticed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Nah not that one, I'm pretty sure</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: huh. interesting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sucks that the signal didn't work all that well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … I should check Tumblr more often.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: at least it was Normal Jade and not Grimbark Jade ;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might be the horror terrors trying to piss me off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: might be.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (("Were made for a water balloon fight that ended in touhous." PFFFFFFFFT))</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((hahahahahahahahaha))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys the Dewey Decimal System doesn't work with books on magic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: does it like, go on a different system?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: 793.8</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: That's the code for books on magic and magic tricks that I remember.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I don't think this kind of magic really works for that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: So? Use it anyway.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what's so important about the dewey decimal system anyways?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I dunno, I just know a lot of codes from it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Guys, you come up with a better method of sorting the books while I cry in a corner.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Make 'em alphabetical I guess</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stick them on a rack and hope that you find the right one</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And how does that help for SUBJECT?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  what is organization <img src='../smilies/mspa_face.png' alt=':mspa:' title=':mspa:' /> --</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Okay. I'll group them by subject, alphabetise the titles in each subject, and alphabetise the subjects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, that works</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Yeah, because we can't do authors real well.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I'm not gonna lie I only barely care about this right now because I"m watching Summer Wars' finale.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Good stuff. Nope, /great/ stuff</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I care about it because it involves books.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I should show Summer Wars, cripes.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Maybe later after the dungeon romp</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that is an awesome movie</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Hell yeah it is!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And what area would each subject be in?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: boo. yah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: We can think about this later i don't even know man.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just give me the books again.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not sure if I'll be able to make it to the dungeon and/or movie though...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: We don't need "area".</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: First thing we should probably do is set 'em up with some kinda database, log 'em all. Then maybe once we've got that info down we figure out how to organize from there and carry on</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Yep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Aw man, what's up Kimura?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: There in the library.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((Dad may or may not need me to mow today...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … are /you/ in the library right now?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ((ah))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: dammit.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its the old armory.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I didn't even /realize/ we had an armory dang</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: there was an armory?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … right then. I dunno where /that/ is. Can I get some directions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Right across the hall.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Awesome.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hey uh, DS and IS, apparently you stayed the night on my land? think I saw SJ out in the distance, but where are you two?</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Don't worry, I used to do this sort of stuff all the time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh, okay...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: How many books /are/ there even?</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: TAKE A BREAK!</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … Dude, why so insistent?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: I've pulled three-hour shifts doing nothing but this sort of stuff on a weekly basis before.</span><br />

<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Used to be a library volunteer, dude.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: RS: actually, I think I can probably make it to the dungeon thing after all. it's a Lethal Lava Land type one, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Hells yeah it is.</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah, the mowing is actually going to be later this afternoon, so I should be able to do at least the first half))</span><br />
<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: … and Raz, with your time sense?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If it starts in an hour, it was probably supposed to start /now/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: I suppose I will wake up for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Yeah. Sweet loot, the locale's crazy (if possibly lethal), it'll be a blast.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: FS. SW33T LOOT. You cannot miss SW33T LOOT.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Just bring fire gear!</span><br />

<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: I will see what I have</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: If you don't have fire gear, we can probably help out :)</span><br />
<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: is it the enemies that are on fire?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7900b5">CFS: or will I be wanting to inflict fire damage?</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: It's a Lethal Lava Land.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Made of fire and lava and stuff, mostly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#7ccfb2">CAG: Bring a fireproof suit or something to protect yourself from the flames/heat.</span><br />
