[01:29] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Just recently got here. Remember me?</span><br />
[01:30] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, but I just woke up a few minutes ago so my brain's still half-asleep...</span><br />
[01:31] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: It's Jess. Also known as AA.</span><br />
[01:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh, gotcha.</span><br />
[01:32] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: So where exactly am I?</span><br />
[01:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: you're at the town bar, Gene's Garden.</span><br />
[01:33] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: a lot of us hang out here... but it's been pretty empty lately for some reason.</span><br />
[01:35] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: I see. I hope to see everyone soon then. I really hope they don't hate me for just disappearing.</span><br />
[01:36] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: nah, you're fine. I think it's just been kind of a slow week and a half lately?</span><br />
[01:37] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: Alrighty then. ^_^ I wonder where everyone is... gosh I haven't seen them in so long.</span><br />
[01:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((tbh, everyone's donetier as fuck with NN after an argument a week ago over something we've been planning...))</span><br />
[01:39] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((Oh))</span><br />
[01:39] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((I see))</span><br />
[01:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((basically, we're planning a kind of post-game story thing, and we wanted to invite Ben (slothfulLunchmeat), but NN was like "no. he's permabaNNed from v2, and either you drop him or drop our setting."))</span><br />
[01:40] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((even though no one owns v2, legally speaking. it's a fanfic of a fanfic, so copyright /cannot/ be claimed on it))</span><br />
[01:41] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((but basically, we're saying "fuck you" and doing our own thing that starts in v2, but goes outside of it and will have a different set of memos and stuff))</span><br />
[01:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((I can't really tell you more until it actually starts, unless you have skype since we've been doing the planning in a skype memo))</span><br />
[01:42] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((I have skype))</span><br />
[01:42] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((also um I didn</span><br />
[01:42] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((I didn't realize that NN was such a control freak))</span><br />
[01:43] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((p much. Ash and Kaylen were originally on their side, but after we kept arguing, they both decided "fuck this, do what you want" and left. NN was the only one that kept falsely claiming copyright))</span><br />
[01:44] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((My god. I dont know why I didn't know this before. Maybe I'm so used to seeing the good in everyone))</span><br />
[01:44] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((anyway, contact SJ on skype (username and display name are both shinyjiggly), and she'll add you to the main v2 memo and stuff.))</span><br />
[01:44] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((It seems obvious now that he's been a control freak all along. And ok))</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((the actual side-RP planning is in a different memo btw, but yeah))</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((and it's okay, I'm like that too, always trying to see the good in everyone.))</span><br />
[01:45] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((He was actually nice to me in the general too. I wouldn't have guessed he'd be an asshat))</span><br />
[01:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((yeah... also careful of the pronouns, NN's actually trans. I just refer to them gender-neutrally to be safe, and also because they have parental monitoring apparently))</span><br />
[01:47] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((which reminds me: NN, Ash (FA), and Kaylen (SG/PT) do not know about this, and we want it to stay that way.))</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((Sorry. Them. Very sorry.))</span><br />
[01:48] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((And I'll stay quiet.))</span><br />
[01:49] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((it's fine. they're kinda triggered by misgendering, so I'm just warning you so you don't get in trouble with them about it ;) ))</span><br />
[01:52] <span style="color:#2fc1ff">CAA: ((Thank you. The least thing I want to do is insult anyone))</span><br />
