<span style="color:#887000">CSL: but thats just a subset of hearts</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so it opposes balloons</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: what canon description?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: that they are a series of pranks and games or whatever</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: remember aranea describes the concept of charms in general but gets cut off before she can break down each</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: moon needs to be candle light romance</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and if you believe aranea, well, look at karkat</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: who thinks <span style="color:#ff0000">♥</span> is /PITY/</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i think a description of charms as a whole is pretty hard to fuck up</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yes. yes they should.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and maybe we'll break the minds of people on Beta Earth by having figured it out :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, we have been working on meanings for Charms.  Heart: Human Companionship Moon: Romance, Kissing, all that stuff Star: DAT ASS</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, have I ot it so far?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and balloon: parental affection</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and balloon was parentalness, I remember that.</span><br />

<span style="color:#887000">CSL: whats clover of the felt do again?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: While a ♥ ☾★ relationship would be a good thing by our standards...</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: n is horseshoe, and U is pot of gold</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what do you mean by home then</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and keep in mind that star-hear-horseshoe needs to be a thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, love of a house</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: this conversation is a waste of time to be having.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: what does that even mean</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: well, mr. yellow sun, tell us what we should be doing at this time of day. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: love of a house</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh you bitch</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I know there're no such things as girls on the internet you can't fool me</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: I was just about to say that again ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ^ unless told</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: hah, hah. very funny.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: I try.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Succeed surprisingly often</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: also no offense but that is an awful definition of horseshoe</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: that was quite lame, actually.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: like, why?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: okay</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: You're quite lame.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: id base it on resemblance to omega myself</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: give me a better example</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: gasp. what a come back.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: how creative.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Could've cleared up the mistake at any time but when you don't people assume you're in fact a guy</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: okay so, lazor lady, what now ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: Squarely on you</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Then what should <span style="color:#800080">Ω</span> be then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: i don't care. i was merely pointing it out.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: It should be /stop taking bullshit seriously/</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: apparently omega was the symbol of vietnam draft protests</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont know how that would work but</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /this is how we got /tentacle junk headcanons for trolls/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: oh god</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: /stop/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: OH GOD</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: oh gog ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: NO STOP WITH THE WHIP</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: GET OUT OF MY BRAIN</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: and of course theres all the "the end" associations</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: ooh, apparently omega male is the opposite of alpha male</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: so it could be a more one-sided &lt;3&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: What do you think would a better use of our time SF?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: sf is what i used to be</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so Disturbing Sexual Fantasys is Ω?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: ugh. i've had enough of the stupidity in this group. i can feel my brain cells slowly killing themselves.</span><br />
<span style="color:#9d001f">CRS: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: not just fantasies, and not just sexual</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: actually doing something productive, maybe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: its domination-based romance</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: :&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color:#0000aa">Noodles: And what productive thing can we accomplish?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and yet that totally means that it would be horrible</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: not necessarily</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: i mean it could just be the idea of the happy housewife except without as many sexist connotations</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: to quote someone</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: "kinky"</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: why should i be telling you? i'm sure you can figure /something/ out. unless of course you really are that low on the food chain you can't even do something as simple as that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A clover could be happyness</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: there doesnt need to be a sexual aspect</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: or just a relationship based on mutual pranks/riddles</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: since thats clover of the felt's thing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: relationships are a waste of time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: sometimes time needs to be waste ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: dont feed the trolls</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: *wasted ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Ashsprite, how do you feel about setting this guy on fire on his Crypt Slab?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and throwing /healing potions at him/</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: so he won't die</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: until we so choose it</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: you don't even know where i am.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: horseshoes could also be sort of the black version of balloons</span><br />
<span style="color:#a80000">CFA: (\  <span style="color:#550000">Ummmmm</span> /)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: you don't know the name of my land or even my own name.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I assume you are a female bowl of fruit</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">?SJ: your name is Lemony Snicket ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: much like noodles</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: of course this makes star-heart-horseshoe much more disturbing</span><br />
<span style="color:#ffd607">CSF: oh, wow. how ever did you come to that conclusion because wow, you are just right on the mark.</span><br />
<span style="color:#887000">CSL: please go</span><br />
