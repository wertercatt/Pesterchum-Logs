<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm sorta woried, once I run out of notes</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: then maybe you won't need to focus on the past anymore</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I won't have any reason to not be picked off by something</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: you're familliar with the term plot armor, right?</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: I am familiar</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's sorta like that</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: but do you really think that you are that unwanted that you believe that is the only thing keeping you here?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: wel, I'm not even sure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *well</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: how so?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it doesn't seem to be a thing with being unwanted, more of just being unsure.</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: Then why do you feel you need a reason to not be picked off?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#d1cfcd">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks down to the ground, sighing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been trying to contact my futureself, but either I'm not answering, or barely any details are being revealed at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm really worried</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: I would be too</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: but she is answering</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: is she not?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: in some instances yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: but most of them are so ambiguous that I can't even tell what to make of them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: also there's the fact that it could have been an earlierfutureself answering messages in the furtherfuture</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: did dave not say that time was not something to think about too much</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been told that quoote multiple times by Kimura already.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *quote</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: I'm sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: well...</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: may I ask what you have been told? or are you not allowed to say?</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: because I have a thought, but I cannot be terribly sure it is the case</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: most of them are just things like "yes, I'm here", but it's hard to tell the context exactly. </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: maybe I'm just overanalyzing things</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: mm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: reassurance perhaps</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: the future version of you would know you were having these thoughts, correct?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: probably.</span><br />
<span style="color:#670c82">CFS: then maybe this is her way of letting you know that everything will be alright after all the letters are delivered</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, future me literally was me in this very moment, so I would at least remember most of it at that point in time.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so.</span><br />
