[06:17] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: AV just informed me.</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: oh god</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: why.</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: why</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: why</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Deep inside I knew this was going to happen.</span><br />
[06:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I only barely managed to escape in time.</span><br />
[06:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: But... CruxiteBuddySprite...</span><br />
[06:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: :&lt;</span><br />
[06:19] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I understand FL.</span><br />
[06:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I... couldn't save him.</span><br />
[06:20] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: My condolances.</span><br />
[06:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I could only save myself...</span><br />
[06:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I am going to kill him.</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: He wasn't infected by the glitch...</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Because he was the cause of it.</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: He was the glitch afterall.</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I know.</span><br />
[06:22] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I´m.. oh god.. svsprite is crying.</span><br />
[06:22] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: He feels the disturbance.</span><br />
[06:23] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: That´s it.</span><br />
[06:23] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I knew this was a bad idea.</span><br />
[06:24] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: But I just explained to myself how the avoidance of this situation was impossible.</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: He wasn't using the energy to stablize the session...</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: he was using it to stablize himself.</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Come to the base if you need a hug.</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I forgive you for your previous idiocy, it it's any consolation.</span><br />
[06:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Alright, I'll toss the sky gem over.</span><br />
[06:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...After I finish the funeral.</span><br />
[06:30] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I'll see you then.</span><br />
[06:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: The gates...</span><br />
[06:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: useless.</span><br />
[06:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...Looks like the nexus became our primary node of transportation.</span><br />
[06:33] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: The nexus?</span><br />
[06:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Yeah, the little room I made on a meteor to use transportalizers to go between lands...</span><br />
[06:33] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I never thought it would have to become a primary node.</span><br />
[06:34] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Where is it located?</span><br />
[06:36] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, I have a transportalizer from my land, and CS's... and SJs. RS has the others, and may have set some up.</span><br />
[06:37] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I guess its time to convert your map back into a shipping chart.</span><br />
[06:38] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: That is my least of worries.</span><br />
[06:39] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Excuse me now. I have to rinse my body of this horrible feeling.</span><br />
[06:47] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I need to see my denizen.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: You and I think alike.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...perhaps he will count my sprite.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: :&lt;</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: You still feel it do you.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: emotions.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: mine have shattered.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...yes.</span><br />
[06:48] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I feel so horrible.</span><br />
[06:49] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: but I can't place it as either sad or angry. Ironic perhaps.</span><br />
[06:49] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: It does not matter.</span><br />
[06:49] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: AV provided me with information on the next action I must undergo.</span><br />
[06:49] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: It is that what you just mentioned.</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...how did I know.</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Chronos was tapping into the code.</span><br />
[06:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I took buddy out for a walk the day before, knowing I might never see him again.</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: We will have to do that.</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Repair the godtier system.</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Acquire power, synergise, organise.</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I hate to say it, but my alternate does have the most experience...</span><br />
[06:53] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: with fighting him.</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: My alternate self speaks of two fraymotifs.</span><br />
[06:54] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: One that locks space, one that locks time.</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: ...I'm glad we never had the glitch of mine fixed.</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: I know what to do.</span><br />
[06:55] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: The one with PIx10 boonbanks.</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Money is no problem then, I presume.</span><br />
[06:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Well, unless we spot something thats more expensive than the money I have.</span><br />
[06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Then while I can transfer the cash to you, I won</span><br />
[06:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: I won't be able to get it myself.</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Don't worry. We can transfer it back to you once we've resolved that gltich and everyone has aqcuired their needed currency.</span><br />
[06:59] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: Or you can just buy it for me.</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: ((So, you play chronos huh? ))</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( What? ))</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: ((I mean, the animation did show a person piggybacking a sprite))</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Oh, no. ))</span><br />
[07:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( That could have been alot of people. ))</span><br />
[07:02] <span style="color:#0080ff">FL: (( Except off screen. ))</span><br />
[07:03] <span style="color:#ff660d">SV: Fine.</span><br />
