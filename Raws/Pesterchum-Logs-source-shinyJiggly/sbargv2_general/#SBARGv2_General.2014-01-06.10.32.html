<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why isn't vlc working why am I so upset about my laptop which is clearly overworking itself when I'm barely running that many programs sdlfkjhadsaf ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#72a0c1">CURRENT imagineBreaker [CIB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: in other news, I finished watching Madoka last night and lets just say: Manga made me sad, Anime ran me over with a train of feels and proceeded to beat the dead corpse afterwards</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  checks task manager, skype is only at 65,636 K, dwm is at 31,548 K, pesterchum is at 20,964 K, the rest is a bunch of smaller background things that are always running, I exited out of dropbox to lessen the slow-down, and usually it's better than this.  --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is whining to an empty crowd --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  also pats --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it could just be random slowdown...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: my lappy sometimes does that for no reason. the entire system behaves like Dolphin choking on a game and doing /everything/ (audio, window animations, etc) at half speed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: what doesn't make sense is that usually vlc will play midis and mp3's when there's more programs running. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, last night when I had 3 different pesterchum windows open. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...is the problem only with VLC, or is the entire system derping?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: mostly vlc at this point. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's probably one of those weird sound driver problems or something. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: even though the pings that all of you seem to hate that I still have active on pesterchum still activate somehow. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: but yeah, the problem I was describing (key giveaway is WMP playing at stuttered half speed and the window tabs in the taskbar slugging along when you open/close windows) is only fixable by rebooting</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ok, another question: did VLC update recently, and did you update it or did it self-update?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've been preventing it from updating to allow it to still play midi files. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: the newer versions got rid of it for some stupid reason. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: oh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, windows media player can still open midis, if all you need is the ability to listen to them.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I mostly like vlc because you can change soundfonts, and I don't like using windows media player anymore because I'm a biased fool. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: eh, guess that makes sense.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I only use vlc for watching streamed videos (though it's been forever since I went in <a href='#ajatt'>#ajatt</a> ), and I use WMP for regular media playback</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  attempts to use winjammer, it encountered an error with the wavetable synth --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, I guess I'll reboot this thing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: brb ➜</span><br />
