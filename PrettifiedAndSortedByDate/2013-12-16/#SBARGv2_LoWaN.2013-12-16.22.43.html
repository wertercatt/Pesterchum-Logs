<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  looks up and groans, standing up, dropping the bottle and his phone. He opens the door, god-tier clothing on, his gold rimmed, red tinted aviators on as always "What?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#72a0c1">CURRENT imagineBreaker [CIB]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  grabs him by his collar and drags him outside into the fresh air. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  just kind of lets it happen. This has happened too many times before. "Ugh, does this have to happen now?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  lands ship and stumbles out, clearly drunk --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  had a serious and concerned look on her face. "Can you tell me about it?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: hey doggy</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  stumbles a bit --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  turns around and waves off the other people. --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT foolishFool <span style="color:#a2a280">[CFF]</span>  just stares. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  steps back and brushes his clothes off. He wasn't that drunk yet. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: ((isn't*))</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: (( how tall is AE))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  stumbles into ship --</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: ((5"11'))</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: (( shoot, eye to eye))</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (Any idea whats going on Kim?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  looks at AE for a moment before motioning back inside. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (not a clue)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  takes off --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  sighs, walking back inside and turning the lights on. Oh yeah, he forgot to clean his brains up the last six or seven times he blew them out. Whoops. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((can i stay to observe))</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: ((Sure.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  walks inside and closes the door behind her. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (...Well, that was fun,)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  notices a lingering smell of something awful. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  didnt think about it too hard though. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (...I really hope they don't kill each other. or Get /busy/.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: WElcomE to CAsA dE ClArkE. MAkE yoursElf At homE.</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (........oh frogs.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (what?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Sorry for being all.. assertive here, I'm not really good at handling some people's certain... "habits".</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (the second thing)</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: It worries me.</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (yeah... sorry. )</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Godtier or not.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: It's fucking cool, don't worry About it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: If I pickEd At thE littlE things I'd spEnd much morE timE in thE mEmos bEing A bitch.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  rubbed the back of her neck. "So... can you tell me whats going on then?" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (So... why is AE so... you know, drunk all the time?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (and should we, ya know, leave?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  laughs, pouring himself another shot of Jack Daniels. "Because I don't want to live anymore, but I'll be damned if I'm going out a coward." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (I wish I knew, and shrug.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: ((Shit, I can word.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: We're all kind of in the same boat here...</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (...well, lovely. So... how ya doing man?)</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: but there is an ending to this game.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I don't know what comes after but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  tries to find the right words. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  leans on the wall. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (getting kinda weirded out by everything, but fine otherwise)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  nods, downing the shot. "Indeed there is, but whatever's after this will be filled with, /her/, and fuck, she's already screwed me over enough. I don't need to be living out the rest of eternity on her leash." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Her?</span><br />
<span style="color:#b5b500">CAE: AshEs.</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: What is between you and Ash?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (Yeah... so am I, to be honest.)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "A very short history of her fucking me over in every way possible and not caring enough to stop me from becoming what I have." He pours another shot and downs it. "Of course, she's not my only reason for it, but she's probably what tipped the iceburg." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: Would you like to give an example...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#a2a280">CFF: (So...)</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "Lying to me, making me feel like I was worth /something/, then forcing me to watch as she went off with another guy." He sighs, leaning his back against the wall. "Oh, and if you haven't already noticed, I'm pretty much a little bitch about everything. What point is there to life when your emotions make every move made by everyone ever seem ten times worse? Not to say Ash is innocent." He wipes his mouth. "I think even --</span><br />
from a normal point of view, cheating on her boyfriend with me, telling me she'd leave him, then dragging me along until I had the guts to walk away." He laughs. "That's some pretty bad shit."<br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  nods slowly and looks to the floor for a moment. "I really have nothing to say to that but... hmm..." --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: You can't let one person ruin your life. Personally I haven't had any kind of intimate relationship but I've always watched other's from the sidelines...</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: I've seen some pretty bad stuff.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT atomicEagle <span style="color:#b5b500">[CAE]</span>  "I can't die, so it's not like I'm actually going to. Plus with me missing the final boss a heroic death is pretty much impossible. I'll just live out my time alone and hope she never calls." He downs another shot. "That's a shame, I'm sure you're a catch, in a good way." He wipes his mouth again. "I wish I agreed with you, but while I'm sat here with no motivation to get out of that chair and stop wasting ammo on my own head, --</span><br />
<span style="color:#72a0c1">CIB: One of these days you might stop thinking like that... heroic death or just death aside, when death comes to your door, you may not think the same way. Personally I'm terrified of death!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT imagineBreaker <span style="color:#72a0c1">[CIB]</span>  laughs awkwardly. --</span><br />
