<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ</span> RIGHT NOW opened memo on board SBARGV2 BLUHWHATEVERWOODS.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  keeps walking, clearly kinda frustrated  --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  heads into the woods with little else to work from --</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  spots SL and starts following --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: oh hey kim</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#2806ea">CURRENT enderQuestral [CEQ]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is a couple paces behind CP --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  calls "NIKI!" --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: hey EQ. you worried about SJ as well?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm. Lately, if someone who is not me nor MP heads into the forest, its not a good sign.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It means someone most likely feels bad for whatever reason, so I need to help in whatever way I can!</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah... this place seems to be like a "go here if you feel bad" thing.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im more confused about what she said in the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: keeping things together?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I dunno then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Last time I checked, we were all insane yet mostly "together?"</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  finds a spot near a tree to sit down --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I mean everyone pisses eachother off from time to time. Just happens.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: and when was it entirely her responsibility anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  shrugs, looking around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  also looks around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I think maybe she feels like she's responsible for keeping the group together since no one else seems to be trying to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: even though for the most part, almost all of us are trying to keep us together.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  keeps looking --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: NIKI!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  hears the yelling, but mostly ignores it --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I just hope we find her before that thing later today...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: NIKI, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Besides, I really can't wait for us all to go into space! I don't want Niki to miss all that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: It just wouldn't be the same without all you dorks there to cause trouble and fun. :P</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, for the space thing, DS said /preliminary/ testing is on wednesday...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dunno if id want to go without her, either...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so we still have time to get everyone settled and back together</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Niki! SJ! Can we all at least calmly chat about the situation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  thinks he almost smells SJ's trail, but decides not to bring it up, and to let her come to them... --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  tosses a rock to the side. The group can probably see it land on the ground up ahead --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Eh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: SJ, is that you?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...who else? michael jackson? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: niki, whats wrong</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: /now/ you care? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: we cared before, you just left the memo</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because suddenly it appears that I don't want to be anyone's trophy wife, even if it makes them happy? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Woah what? Who has been saying anything around those lines?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...what?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Who do I need to beat up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: every single freaking day I hear the same broken record "wweh forever alone". ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: uh, what.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and it feels like I'm being... railroaded into being coddled into fixing that, but I'm not sure if I want that to be my future. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i didnt realize...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and now I just made certain people feel horrible. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just because I have opinions. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...huh?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Okay. Well, first thing is first: You know that whining about it does not mean they want a solution right that second. Also, you are in control of your own life; You don't want that sort of situation with a person, then you dont have to have that situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If anyone ever pressures you into that sort of thing... ooooh boy /THEN/ I'll have quite a few words to say to that person.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah. no one should be forced into /anything/.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I don't want anyone to hurt anybody else just because I'm having a hissy fit. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: You are not hurting anyone. No, not at all.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i never meant to feel like i was pressuring anyone... i was never even trying to talk to anyone specific</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: just putting my problems out into the void... shit, im an insensitive asshat</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: yeah, it was all an out-of-context misunderstanding...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was more talking about worring about what you guys might erronously do in an attempt to keep their "perfect woman" blindly content. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: *worrying ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I could tell you were about to punch someone in the face just because of my stupid feelings. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...i...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CFA</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: geez, i dont even know how to react to this...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: me either, SL...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Because I thought someone was hurting you! If anyone phyiscally or emotionally hurta anyone here, then I am going to take a stand! Besides, I've learned that a relationship with no arguments is not exactly a good one.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Seriously. Fairy-tale relationships are not things to strive for. Some people need to realize that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: yeah, it was never...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((oh shit I forgot about my shower...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  is just rambling now, honestly. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT slothfulLunchmeat <span style="color:#2d8a18">[CSL]</span>  is just speechless --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT enderQuestral <span style="color:#2806ea">[CEQ]</span>  //CP go shower, then. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: doesn't mean that the solution should be so rash though. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  is a zoned-out chum. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I've always wondered, why do you guys even care about me? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...because youre a friend</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True. -And being in a relationship with someone, not because of love or companionship but because you two are part of a simmilar group? Rash and unhealthy, I would say- Yeah! Because you are a friend!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Friend help each other out, yet also annoy each other!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: *Friends</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: Hannah, do you even know what you're even talking about? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have a feeling that you barely know what the situation even is. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: /i/ barely know what the situation is</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: what are you so upset about?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I might not always, no. I however do know that, if you care about someone, you keep them safe as well as you can.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -And coddling and letting them force themselves into a situation or feeling is NOT safe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...why did you feel so personally targeted by my bemoaning my relationship problems?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i never meant to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((still typing...))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: For as long as I've been thick with you guys, I've tryed to be there when needed. But sometimes, I just feel so burnt out, even when there's clearly those in the group that I worry about sometimes. Ben, I've seen you in emotional distress in the memo and always the subject of being torn down by others. I felt like I could maybe make you happy for at least a moment when nobody else could, but it never ends and I feel so tied down and useless, not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I've seen Shon get jealous sometimes... disasters and lack of logic seem to follow him everywhere though... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...you dont need to do anything like that for me...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sometimes it feels like I care too much... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and then I don't care enough. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no, theres... i didnt realize...</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sighs for the 576th time  --</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Just... Well, to care for everyone, you also have to care for yourself. I'm... now not so sure what else to say on the matter.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: christ, im so insensitive</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Nah. You were just talking about your feelings, and you did not expect this sort of reaction. If you did know about all this before hand, then yes you would have been insensitive.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i should have recognized... fuck</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: but, really... you don't... need to do anything like that, niki</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's alright, I probably kept my thoughts too wrapped up to even be noticable anyways. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i... christ, no one should feel obligated to do /anything/ because of me</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why not? somebody has to care about you out there... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i dont want it to happen like this, you know?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if someone... genuinely cared about me, that would be great, but...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess you have a point... I just wish others would take the initiative sometimes... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so I wouldn't feel like being another jerk in the crowd. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((i gotta take a mini-break because parents, so event pause i guess))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((okay))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ((alright back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: i just...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: why didnt you say anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also back))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: because I'm a manipulative jerk who just wants to avoid pain? I don't even know. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((back x 3))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: no, you just had to...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: christ, i didnt know</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Sometimes you just don't really have a reason for not speaking up? </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess you could put it that way. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Kinda like how I never really spoke up against that one "SS" guy.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah... /that guy/. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: if you had told me in advance, maybe... maybe we could have worked something out...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and SJ, I know what it's like to want to speak up, but not knowing what to say if I do...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so don't think you're the only one feeling like that, because it's common and completely natural to be confused about others' emotions.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm. Exactly.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: im just... im sorry</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: is there any way we can help, now that we know something's up?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: well i can stop whining about how lonely i am for starters...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'm not even sure what. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...dont feel any sort of obligation, okay?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...I'll try not to. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2d8a18">CSL: ...ready to head back to town?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I guess so. ➜</span><br />
