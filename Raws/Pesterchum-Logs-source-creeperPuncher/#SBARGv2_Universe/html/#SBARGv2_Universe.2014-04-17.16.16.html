[05:28] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: ...sorry</span><br />
[05:32] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's okay</span><br />
[05:40] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Anything happen at your arcade of legends?</span><br />
[05:42] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: no, because NoSuchLocationException.</span><br />
[05:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Kimura, don't lie to me.</span><br />
[05:44] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I /know/ you all have a secret hideout.</span><br />

[05:59] <span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#225604">CURRENT crazedPyrotechnic [CCP]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
[05:59] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: what</span><br />
[06:00] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: seriously do they have some sort of island with an arcade and everything?</span><br />
[06:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[06:01] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((........))</span><br />
[06:01] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Maybe they are building soulbots and robotic limbs there in secret</span><br />
[06:03] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: cheer up charles, if i actually had a secret private island lair, you'd be the first person i wouldn't invite</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So are you saying I need to look for the island and then KICK DOWN THE FRONT DOOR?</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: no i mean i'd fucking rub it in your face, but i wouldn't invite you</span><br />
[06:07] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: in fact, fair warning, if either of you nerds find my evil tropical island lair when i get it</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: you're to be shot on sight.</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: by warlocks.</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: So wear power armor.</span><br />
[06:08] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Got it.</span><br />
[06:12] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: That's... not going to work.</span><br />
[06:16] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Most Power Armor would be able to take heat fairly well, and the kinetic acceleration of air into a large missile would have little to no effect.</span><br />
[06:17] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: Are you assuming we'd be using simple cantrips to disarm you?</span><br />
[06:19] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Of course, I might need to modify it so electric attacks would only power it up, and enough heat sinks to melt any ice that covers it.</span><br />
[06:20] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: We're not exactly the barbarians you take us for.</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Though perhaps I would need to put some of the research I did in the session to use, in order to prevent psychic attacks.</span><br />
[06:21] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: Psychic.</span><br />
[06:22] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: The mind is a powerful thing, Isaac.</span><br />
[06:22] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........</span><br />
[06:23] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: Y'know, I'd love for you to start implicating you're psychic.</span><br />
[06:23] <span style="color:#225604">CCP: Dad'd totally kick your ass, Charles.</span><br />
[06:23] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: Oh please.</span><br />
[06:23] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: I am /not/ psychic.</span><br />
[06:26] <span style="color:#0078f0">CFL: And with the amount of bullshit that goes through my head, I pity whoever would try to read me.</span><br />
