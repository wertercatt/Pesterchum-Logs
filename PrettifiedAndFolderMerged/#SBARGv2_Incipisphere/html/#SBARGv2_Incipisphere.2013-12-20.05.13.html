[11:17:02] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: wait, would it be impossible to dedicate the server?</span><br />

[11:18:58] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its simple.</span><br />
[11:19:03] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Her client is a god.</span><br />
[11:19:38] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and AC, I /could/ do a dedicated server if I could find one I didn't have to pay for, but it's just simpler (and makes server security easier ;) ) to host locally.</span><br />
[11:19:54] <span style="color:#00e100">CAC: ah</span><br />
[11:21:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: But um, I would like to have one of the FTB packs that includes Applied Energistics if we decide to do a FTB server.</span><br />
[11:23:05] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And maybe Mystcraft and Forge Multipart</span><br />
[11:25:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So, maybe the Tech World 2 pack</span><br />
[11:25:17] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, I'm thinking that when OptiFine updates to 1.7.2/.4 (since that's the whole reason I made the server 1.6.4), we'll do a new map and it'll be FTB. and when we get to that point, send me a list of the mods you want on there.</span><br />
[11:25:25] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: not gonna worry about FTB until then :P</span><br />

[11:26:21] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...ah.</span><br />
[11:27:05] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I still want to run a vanilla map for a while, since everyone was having fun with it yesterday... and if we go mods, I really want it to be a fresh map.</span><br />
