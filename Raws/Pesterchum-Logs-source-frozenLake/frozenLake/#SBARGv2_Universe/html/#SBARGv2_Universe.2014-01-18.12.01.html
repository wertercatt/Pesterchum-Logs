[01:29:01] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah, it's a clock. ➜</span><br />
[01:29:10] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: oh ok</span><br />
[01:29:10] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: clocks count upwards ➜</span><br />
[01:29:24] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its not another countdown.</span><br />
[01:29:26] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: didn'τ know iτ was a clock</span><br />
[01:29:30] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (thank god for that)</span><br />
[01:30:12] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I goτ so used τo counτdowns, man</span><br />
[01:31:31] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, once we add all the fancy stuff, I could have countdowns to things.</span><br />
[01:31:52] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like, the new year for the planet if we decide to go from the year zero I have.</span><br />
[01:32:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Which is the Unix Epoch</span><br />
[01:33:32] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or should I start counting from the day the planet was created?</span><br />
[01:33:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Man, this shit is /confusing/</span><br />
[01:34:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Anyone have an issue with the Unix Epoch being used as a basis?</span><br />
[01:35:09] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: not sure exactly. ➜</span><br />
[01:35:31] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: shrug</span><br />
[01:36:17] <span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: my brain imploded.</span><br />
[01:36:19] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: other than the philosophical argument of basing a zero point on the timescale of a planet in a completely different universe, it seems logical.</span><br />
[01:37:00] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Eh, they will likely change it in a few thousand years anyways.</span><br />
[01:37:28] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Or maybe just 20.</span><br />
[01:37:45] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: The Ring server /is/ 64-bit.</span><br />
[01:37:56] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: So we don't need to worry about that.</span><br />
[01:38:14] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I thought the Year 2038 Problem was only 32-b-- oh, nvm</span><br />
[01:38:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: wait, did I make it 64-bit or 256-bit?</span><br />
[01:39:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Now, to get onto the biggest question of all...</span><br />
[01:39:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...What the fuck do we /name/ this planet?</span><br />
[01:39:52] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I have no idea. ➜</span><br />
[01:40:24] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I was going under the assumption that starterplanet is pretty much it's name now. ➜</span><br />
[01:40:38] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sometimes just starter for short. ➜</span><br />
[01:40:42] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...lets name it after Deiwos or another of Ash's frogs.</span><br />
[01:41:01] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, when we talk to aliens its gonna be awkward if we have a name like that!</span><br />
[01:41:51] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dude, the troll name for alternia is trollplanet. ➜</span><br />
[01:42:00] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Eh... Starter is honestly good enough. Besides, do you honestly want to name a planet inside a universe-frog after a frog that was used to make said universe?</span><br />
[01:42:19] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, its /one of the many planets that make up the universe/</span><br />
[01:42:48] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Like how Deiwos was one of the many frogs that made up Gene.</span><br />
[01:42:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: tell you what, FL. if we decide to make other planets later, /you/ get to come up with names for some of them ;)</span><br />
[01:44:10] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah. I myself like just keeping this planets name simple and sweet. Starter is honestly good enough, in my opinion-</span><br />
[01:44:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, how the heck do I stick this thing into a thing? I have a div with the class "thingie". ➜</span><br />
[01:44:32] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: also gaaaah I keep forgetting to nag SL and DS about when we get moving.</span><br />
[01:45:10] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if you assume 10 letter planet names, we have 141167095653376 possible names if we limit to 10 letters.</span><br />
[01:45:22] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And much less if you wanna follow the rules of the english language.</span><br />
[01:45:59] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: FL, you're starting to sound like a what-if.xkcd.com article.</span><br />
[01:46:18] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 32577022073856 if you have to have /one vowel/</span><br />
[01:47:07] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Thats less than 1/4th, and thats only making sure a vowel is in it!</span><br />
[01:47:38] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: like yzzzzzzzzz isn't really a good planet name.</span><br />
[01:49:29] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...here's a better question: Y is not a vowel under everyday rules of english.</span><br />
[01:49:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: change body in innerhtml to... wait, we don't need the first document body since it will clear it every time!</span><br />
[01:49:51] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Sometimes Y is a vowel.</span><br />
[01:50:17] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y.</span><br />
[01:50:23] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I tried changing it to div, and i tried changing it to thingie, but that didn't do anything. ➜</span><br />
[01:51:06] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: then again, I think i broke it anyways. ➜</span><br />
[01:51:06] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I said, under /everyday/ rules. only hardcode linguists follow the "sometimes Y" part.</span><br />
[01:51:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Why.</span><br />
[01:51:35] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (thats an example)</span><br />
[01:52:02] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: &gt;_&gt;</span><br />
[01:53:05] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: okay, I can't think straight. maybe someone else can put it in a fancy thing. ➜</span><br />
[01:54:06] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: document.getElementById('td1').innerHTML</span><br />
[01:54:25] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: if you use that ID in a place, it will put it in there.</span><br />
[02:01:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: I reject your insanity and substitute my own.</span><br />
[02:01:37] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: er...</span><br />
[02:01:39] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: wrong paste.</span><br />

[02:01:46] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: that's the right one</span><br />
[02:02:00] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: also, about to snooze out</span><br />
[02:02:11] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Either copy-paste is still relevent</span><br />
[02:02:34] <span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: indeed</span><br />
[02:02:34] <span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -Also, 'Night CP.</span><br />

[02:28:43] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: is everyone asleep already? ➜</span><br />
[02:28:50] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: nope</span><br />
[02:29:40] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, you still seem to be using the basic Tumblr code...</span><br />
[02:29:49] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: which might be throwing it off.</span><br />
[02:30:27] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I put it on custom layout so I could define the style ➜</span><br />
[02:30:43] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah...</span><br />
[02:32:20] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I think the Javascript you copied over from Tumblr is conflicting.</span><br />
[02:33:19] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it automatically inserts the dumb tumblog script thing. ➜</span><br />
[02:36:21] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: uploaded to dropbox, still the same problem without the tumblog thing: <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59572658/pesterlogs/tiemer.html'>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59572658/pesterlogs/tiemer.html</a> ➜</span><br />
[02:43:46] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: add document before the getElementbyid</span><br />
[02:44:08] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: should be document.getElementById('td1').innerHTML</span><br />
[02:50:00] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I readded it back in, didn't fix it. ➜</span><br />
[02:55:16] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...ahahaha</span><br />
[02:55:29] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hold on.</span><br />
[02:59:15] <span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, move the javascript to the /end/ of the page.</span><br />
[03:02:26] <span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: stuck it in a bunch of places, didn't change it. ➜</span><br />
