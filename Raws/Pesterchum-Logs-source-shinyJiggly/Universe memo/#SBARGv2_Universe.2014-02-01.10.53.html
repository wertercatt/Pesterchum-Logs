<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Getting one to fall asleep is one thing, keeping someone from having nightmares... well, thats an entirely different problem.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why do I still feel horrible about not being able to do anything about it on that day... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Honestly? I have no clue how to stop nightmares, besides talking to people about them... and maybe try and realize its a dream within the dream...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I τried changing iτ while lucid buτ iτ had...disasτerous effecτs</span><br />

<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Yeah... changing your dream whilst dreaming doesnt seem to work for you, hm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: My only other reccomendation is talking to someone about it. Maybe a plushie of yours who has yet to hear much about the session?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Simple "therapy" like that can do a lot... but again: it depends on the person and the situation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hm..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: You know, I kinda wanna do the AU Machine with a large group.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: are you sure the thing would be able to handle it? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Hm... why not, then?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course I would need to find a scenario everyone would agree with...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: mmhm..</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Dwarf Fortress?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: uh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: no thanks ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait no, thats stupid.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Know litterally nothing about that, so yeaaah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...maybe a second try at a Harry Potter AU?</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: can I noτ die τhis τime</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -That... actually, I wouldnt mind that. It could sound fun, at least.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, lets make sure Kat doesn't become Horcrux fuel this time around.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: (also I will know not to mess with polyjuice...) -Sounds good.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: It might end up sorting you into completely different houses than the first scenario.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just to let you know, I really only know the bare basics about harry potter stuff.  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its likely I'll get voted into the same house I was last time... So lets not panic about that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: hm.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'll have to hold back the magical knowledge I got last time in the AU...</span><br />
<span style="color:#6507ff">CTT: I forgoτ a loτ abouτ τhe series besides τhe basics</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Alright, then I guess you will be learning as you go along.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 'Sure sounds like it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Not sure where the start point will be in the AU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Could be on the train, could be at diagon alley, it could even be halfway through the 5th year.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least I managed to adjust it so Tom Riddle doesn't exist in this AU.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I swear we won't get blindsided like the Half Life Loop.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Thaaaat's fortunate... but yeah: I think dropping us off at a random point could be an interesting challenge. We could know little at the begining of the first year, or we could know little in the middle of the fifth.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Who knows. It could be fun, though.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: First year. Totally First Year.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I'm gonna be going shopping for quite a few hours, probably won't be here for the event...;-;))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Actually, I'm gonna add Riddle back in. Too much of a ripple effect.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Are you so sure about that...?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Do you /want/ Umbridge as the Headmaster first year?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... True, but do you want to deal with Riddle in the /first year/?!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Pick your poison.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Riddle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: One thousand times riddle.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Oy...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Basically, Riddle is required for Hagrid to be the grounds keeper.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ... Good point.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...But I should be able to repress him from becoming too big of an issue.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, at the least, we should know near the end of the first year.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: If so, then please do so. I somehow doubt all of us as first-years would be able to do much of /anything/ against Riddle, if needed. </span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: True...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I have the best plan for this. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( And you will either love or hate me for it. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ((I'll probably be back in about 3-4 hours or something @ _@))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: (( I can wait. ))</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: ((I am now excited and scared for this- I think we can wait, yeah.))</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Gonna need to wait for the Pre-Generation to complete.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Alrighty.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, thats about 50 years getting changed.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: 's reasonable that it would take a while to get ready then, yeah.</span><br />

<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#0080ff">CURRENT frozenLake [CFL]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Hannah. Kinetic Weapons.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: no</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Wait, no.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Too much recoil.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: No. Just.... no Kinetic bombardment weapons. No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Oh bombardment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Lets see... what would be best for a Battle between two spaceships...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Well, energy shielding is a must.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Of course. But thats just defence itself.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...Wait, we could actually weaponize it!</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Noooo no. No.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: If we boost the shielding for a short period of time, we can use it to carve a path through enemy ships!</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course, we would need to have... Alright, that won't work either I think.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Mhm...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: We would need to have the mass energy of the enemy ship going through the shields at the time, which is well... /possilbe/, but not feasable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: possible*</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Plus our own shields would end up slowing us down.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: So, yeaaah...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, if we could study Brad or another void player, we could create missiles that could phase out of reality for a brief moment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And then Telefrag the opposing ship.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: pft... good luck with that</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, our best shots would either be Lasers or Nuclear Weapons. In space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Not Nuclear weapons, considering the mess that we would make... Lasers, on the other hand...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Of course we could try to fire a shell of magnetically contained plasma...</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Well, you have to be accurate. Very accurate. But even a small-scale laser can cut through some plateing, and...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: At least we aren't making planet killers.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: 10^38 joules of energy is a /tad/ bit out of our range.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: and by a tad I mean a whole fucking lot.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: After all, none of our powers really work for direct energy creation.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: -true enough.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, its likely a Void player could create something that violates conservation of energy, but here, we gotta abide by it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Come to think about it, is a void player violating conservation of mass itself? or is it summoning objects from another universe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Might have to study that.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: shrug</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I mean, I think the Golden Power Nodes work by creating a dimentional gateway to a paralel universe that has infinite energy... or It might be just connected to the green sun or something.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Its just, eventually, we will have to disable all of them to avoid a big crunch...</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Won't really matter by then though, I guess.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: How long will "eventually" be? Because we have the lifespan of a universe, really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Well, I might have to study what I believe to be the edge.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Because wasn't our old universe wraparound according to the cosmic microwave radiation?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: I have no clue. I did not have the chance to study much of the old universe, really.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I question why time players are doomed if they come from a doomed timeline, but information and objects... can't seem to be doomed?</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: How do you doom something that isnt alive in the first place?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Infact, I wonder why things get doomed in the first place!</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#941894">CURRENT moroseTerminator [CMT]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#941894">CMT: It can still theoretically be destroyed though, can't it?</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...So, make that Void /and/ Time that violate conservation of Mass/Energy</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: In theory... But then you just have that item in (x) number of peices, or whatever else happened to destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Wait, space players can scale objects.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Because its matter would still exist, yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Void, Time, and Space.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: ...I'm gonna end up figuring out a way that all aspects can be used to violate conservation of energy and mass.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Shrug. Physics during and after the game confuse me. Some things are intact, but others are not and... bleh.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: I swear, if I end up living to near the end of the universe, I'm going to fight a Cherub.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: Just so I don't end up floating in an empty void forever.</span><br />
<span style="color:#2806ea">CEQ: Please do not do that. Besides, 1. I somehow doubt you will not encounter one heroic or just situation in... how many years there are in a universe. 2. Even then... you could find a planet which is destined to play the game later on.</span><br />
<span style="color:#0080ff">CFL: And 3, I could stash the ring server in my sylladex until after the universe ends then uncaptcha it and just... do the AU Machine on endless loop mode.</span><br />
