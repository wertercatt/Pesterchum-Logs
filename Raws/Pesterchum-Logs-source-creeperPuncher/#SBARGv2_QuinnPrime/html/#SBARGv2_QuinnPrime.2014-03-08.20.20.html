<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads upstairs looking for - and finding - her --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: hey there Kim. ➜</span><br />

<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: so, the airlock thingy?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: yeah. I think that one guy wants to come inside. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: alright. I'll show you... I /think/ the controls are simple, but... yeah.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  heads toward the airlock, waiting for SJ to follow --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  follows behind Kimura --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  gets to the airlock... and yeah, let's just say the controls are "Zenon"-tier user friendly --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  looks at the thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: let's see... close inner door... *pulls right lever down* ...depressurize airlock... *slowly turns middle knob counterclockwise* ...open outer door... *pushes left lever up*</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  perks a bit and floats over --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  once CC is inside, he does the things in the reverse order, closing outer, repressurizing, opening inner --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC:  /me watches interested in the mechanics</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: and that is basically how you do it, apparently.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: what an odd vehicle...being in space...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I think there's an interlock preventing both doors from opening at once... I hope.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, hi there  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  waves at the new guy --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  looks from the door system and looks towards SJ, suddenly smiling a little and bows to her before standing up --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Greetings</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: and voila...I stand before thee, exisiting.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  smirks a bit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: nice to see you made it here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Yes, magic is...extremely useful</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Of course now...You'll never be able to keep me out of the vehicle without it</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Not that I intend to give you reason to take such measures</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  will casually remind everyone that he looks to be 14 --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so... what brings you to the Quinn Prime? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  blinks --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I believe you already are aware of my somewhat...silly...reasoning for appearing here today</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: why do I always forget details so often... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I came because you did not recall my appearance after I appeared at the bar despite not wishing to endanger any timeline</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: And to me, that was unacceptable.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh yeah, that... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: sorry about that, by the way. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: it is fine, and it has been corrected...</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Though i do not know the cost, as i am not a time player</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  blinks and looks curiously at kim. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Hello there</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: sup.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Beg pardon?</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...I said "sup"?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's short for "what's up", which is an informal greeting. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Oh</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ...sorry, didn't know you were unfamiliar with english slang.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  starts to appear lost --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I am only somewhat familiar</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((nix last grey text))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464"><span style="color:#000000">CCP</span> ceased responding to memo.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I suppose I must thank my more...vulgar...friend for that which I already have learned</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  remembers a thing and ports back to the planet --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  just sorta stands around --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  watches him leave and sort of shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Well...perhaps I might be able to ask you time questions?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, sure. Let's go to the main room first. Kinda tired of standing. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: after you</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  begins walking towards the main room --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  quietly follows her --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  sits down in one of the chairs at the kinda cheap looking table --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  doesn't care about the look of a table, sits down --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: so, what's your first question? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Well, it's more of a question of my situation in general</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I am currently...at least a thousand of my planet's years away from being...created...</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: huh, got sent back that far? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Yes. i am unsure if it is lucky or unlucky. But I'm not returning to the surface anytime soon</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, I understand. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: want to minimalize prior interactions. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: of course...since I am so unfamiliar with the territory..that being time manipulation..I have tried extending it to all races and planets</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: However, I am experiencing a sort of..cabin fever..if you would.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: And my friends seem to be unable to cease their arguments</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh man...  ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: that's really gotta suck... ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: It does indeed suck</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: just wondering, did you happen to keep some history books or whatever from your native timeframe? because that might be helpful. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, if you know what you're avoiding, it's a lot easier tododge it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: and with that out of the way, you won't have to worry about screwing anything up. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I'd rather not go there at all, honestly. </span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: alright then, just a suggestion. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Yes, and thank you for that</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I was wondering more about my interactions with your people</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ...with my people? do you mean the folks that are usually at the bar and/or in the memo? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: kinda confused here. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  nods --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: ah, okay. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: um, kinda of a vague query still. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  sighs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I don't know how to not be vague</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: would you concider my interactions with your group to be temporallly safe?</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: oh, that. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: dunno, probably? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: like, I doubt it's gonna mess up any timeloops on either end, considering you can connect to the memo just fine with us. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: your conclusion is bot releiving...and confusing</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: it's sometimes hard to tell these kinda things. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT creeperPuncher <span style="color:#ee1e00">[CCP]</span>  //muffled echo of "I HATE TIME TRAVEL" from DN earlier :P --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: ((XD))</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  sighs a bit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Well then, perhaps you will be seeing me more often</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I can't tell if that will either be good or bad for you</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: eh, could be either way, but I'm cool with it. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  nods a bit, pulling out what looks to be a leather bound soft cover book and a quill. it lights up as he opens it and begins to write --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  this is him chatting --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  is typing a thing with her glassestop, which pretty much just glasses with the reflection of a pesterchum window --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  looks up at her as she does this and looks interested --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  yawns a bit --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  returns attention to his book thing --</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  chuckles a bit to himself after his last chat comment before closing the book and putting it away along with his quill. --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Well then.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: It's been a long while since I've plagued anyone.</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: heh. I guess we'll see what happens next? ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Oh. I know what will come of my company. </span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  shrugs --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I can only describe it as...chaotic. You should all be glad that i' not actual chaos though. It  would not end well for your group.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  smirks a bit and bows again --</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: Good evening to you,miss. You should get some sleep.</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT shinyJiggly <span style="color:#cb7de6">[CSJ]</span>  chuckles a little --</span><br />
<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: I'll get to bed eventually. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#646464">-- CURRENT courteousCalamity <span style="color:#41dd11">[CCC]</span>  smiles some, appearing a bit of a gentle type of happy before seemingly just...not being there anymore. --</span><br />
