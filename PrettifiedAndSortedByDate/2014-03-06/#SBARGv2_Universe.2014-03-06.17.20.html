<span style="color:#000000">CTT: ((pft))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((also sprite-style opinion question: PO and RS are the only black characters in v2, apparently. should I make PO's sprite reflect that, or keep the skin color aracial like the other sprites and just draw his dreds?))</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ((probably depends on what RS does with his sprite, I guess))</span><br />
<span style="color:#1bc20a">CVE: th' fuck you talkin' 'bout "fate"</span><br />
<span style="color:#1bc20a">CVE: the only "fate" y'all gotta accept is th' one y'subject y'self to</span><br />

<span style="color:#722881">CAS: There's a fucking battle with life-sucking trees because some dipshit girl has issues with another one. i lost my fucking mind because of brad and connor. and people around here are generally too stupid and chaotic for me</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: well, I do have a two-way method of getting there, in case you change your mind later or want to return once we deal with the Kat issue...</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (come to think of it I need to make it so it can be opened from either end... remind me to ask FL once he fixes the damn AU Machine to replicate a Door Station for me)</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: (...i have the utmost confidence that you can remind yourself)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: (:P)</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: The answer SJ is that the only thing I'm sure of is that I can't stay here</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: it's just not safe around here anymore?</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: I don't even know if it was safe for my mind past the first night</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: ........fair enough?</span><br />
<span style="color:#722881">CAS: But I broke, and we are all lucky it was just towards myself</span><br />

<span style="color:#cb7de6">CSJ: well hey: if she's gonna be safer this way, maybe it's for the best. ➜</span><br />
<span style="color:#ee1e00">CCP: plus like I said, it's not a one-way trip, she can return anytime.</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I'm sure her decision is well thought out</span><br />
<span style="color:#41dd11">CCC: I'm just curious how she knew about me, and why she called me faust</span><br />
